On the strengths, it began with a high note and got me glued with expectations and promises. The instructor sounded extremely comfortable and confident with her subject, and had a very calming and pleasant presence which helped establish a kind of ""remote"" trust. On the improvement areas, I however have a few to list. For one, the intensity, rigour and to-the-pointedness of the content sharply fell after the first week. Having known about mindfulness, Metta meditations, gratitude, it became personally disappointing to me how this course conveyed so little about them and impacted so less than can be possible with the time and space alloted. The framework which initially looked hopeful is perhaps not the best framework, as much as is said about this not being ""spectator course"". Because this format diluted the intensity and possibility of the course, making it drag and bore towards the end. I wish there were guest interviews of more experienced academicians than what happened here as interviews from which there was little to learn. Honestly, this is my 4th of 5th course on positive psychology and this one will have to make many a fixes to any other that I've taken on coursera. The course ended and I find myself not a tad upbeater or nourished, or knowing something useful that I did not know already other than about vegas nerves which really did not make sense to end user who are here to know what and how to do things and feel better.",0,9,Sinjini Sengupta,9329679

Barbare is not the greatest and most charismatic speaker in the world, although she did surprise me in her TED talk.in general, human emotions are operating on a scale from positive to negative. Positive Psychology takes a one-sided approach by looking only on the plus side. That is about as incomplete as the approach of focusing only on the pathology.

provides a sound introduction to the subject. Her attitude and pleasantness
goes a long way into making the case for positive psychology. The group as a
whole provides diverse notions and feedback which is also broadening. With this, there are several things that could be improved I
believe. The quizzes could and should be more challenging, and formulated in a
way to distinguish participants from non participants (often, the answers are
too logical to be challenging). i would urge more interactivity as much as possible, this allows
engagement, and improves learning significantly. In previous courses we had
assignments completed by the students, which were read and graded by the students of the course. Finally, it would be extremely useful to have a venue to share
not only thoughts and feedback, but also ideas for future research. Prof Frederickson, I think you
will be positively surprised at the amount of innovation that could result from asking
your students to come with research questions. For example, my proposal would be to further explore, research,
and teach about the effect of volunteering on one's well being and positivity
status. PS, i will be visiting Research Triangle on another business soon, and would be delighted to briefly meet and discuss some of these ideas.Thank you, Yotam Levin, MD, MBA. Israel",0,0,Yotam Levin,10030167

This fantastic and well-designed course provides me with the “night-version goggle” to actively feel the “love” through noticing the Micro-moment and building positive connection with others to form the positive resonance. The assignment of each week is really practical and beneficial to empower me every day. For instance, I have been keeping writing the “Gratitude Notes” for several weeks and every time I encounter some hard time, I will reflect those grateful blessings I own now and my mood will turn better to face the challenge. Also, sometimes when I am down or tired, I will take the “lovingkindness meditation” after which I will feel much better. Beside, based on this amazing experience, I will continue my positive psychology learning and chose a positive psychology course in my university next semester as well.

It almost makes me want to join the group.  About the only thing missing is a glowing fireplace!  She also emanates a very positive, open approach, again teaching by example, which I believe is the best way to teach.Finally, I am very comforted by the knowledge Positive Psychology supports the teachings of Buddha and Jesus, which essentially is ""As you think, so shall you be.""
