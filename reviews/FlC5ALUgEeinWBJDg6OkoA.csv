35135161~COURSE!~FlC5ALUgEeinWBJDg6OkoA,1659390494331,3,0,"I've been enjoying this specialization but I was disappointed in a number of problems with this one.  Questions on quizzes were prior to the actual lesson those questions came from.  Some of the quizzes had questions that were not topics from lectures and these questions were straight recall and not critical thinking.  On the final, the same question appeared twice!  Are the videos transcribed using some thyp of AI?  I kept having to stop the video to correct the transcript and this slowed me down.  In addition, the overall course outline was lacking figures shown in the video even though figures were supposed to be in the outline.  I had to copy a lot of these missing figures to put them together with the transcript for better understanding.",0,0,Vickie Rae Roettger,35135161

I came searching for a holistic understanding of immunology through this specialization, and while I did learn, I felt that the courses failed to transition concepts and put everything together as a painting.Evaluations focus on memorizing regurgitating minute factoids rather than learning. I find courses went progressively downhill after the first one, which was wonderful.",0,1,Jay Pimprikar,61574839
