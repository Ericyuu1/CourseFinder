63909888~COURSE!~94jQ-3EnEeWhZxJhllGpHQ,1653754756839,1,0,"​I do not doubt the instructor's skill, experience and knowledge in the field of Agile, however, he's not a good teacher. This class was extremely stressful because most of the time is spent trying to keep up with what he's saying and understand the content. As such, this course is not for beginners who are looking to learn about Agile, Scrum, etc, or anyone who is not an expert to be honest. I​ pushed through the course in hopes that the clarity gained along the way would make up for all the stress and turmoil from the begininnng and majority of the course, but unfortunately, I did not feel as though I learned enough to feel at ease or confident in what I gained intellectually after completing this class.H​e would talk extremely fast, fly through slides, his handwriting was not legible (respectfully), and as I previously stated, he would not break down concepts and really teach them so that the viewers could gain an undrestanding of Agile. This seemed to be more of a ""brush up"" course for people who already are or have been in the Agile field for a while. ",0,1,Lara Sedaghat,63909888

I am not a beginner in Product management and Agile, but even for beginners it is nothing, you learn nothing, nichts, zero, null. Also I should mention Alex' way of delivering the information. With very serious face and with very very difficult words he speaks very very simple things, so that it's almost impossible to realise what he is talking about. And he makes gestures, like a Jedi or a seagull! I have an impression that he himself took a special presentation course there somebody talk  him to make gestures during presentation. So he makes gestures like a windmill. All the time I tried to concentrate on his words and not to pay attention to these awfull gestures. So I recommend to take another course or simply read a book about Product management and Agile.",0,0,Boris Rotenstein,70064083
101060438~COURSE!~94jQ-3EnEeWhZxJhllGpHQ,1649611936295,1,0,"Based on my personal experience, I would advise against taking this course.  T​he content is OK, but the delivery leaves a lot to be desired.  Ironically for a course talking about agile and lean start up philosophies, this is delivered in the extremely old-fashioned way of having someone talk at you (also, if I'm honest, in a quite American waffle, which isn't particularly user-friendly for those whose first language isn't American English).  Oh, that said, they do give you about 3 minutes of a ridiculous 'skit' to illustrate the point... But really nothing innovative or experimental at all here..! H​owever, much, much worse than that is the fact that it is a hotbed for people who want to 'scam' a qualification.  There appears to be no vetting of 'students' whatsoever.  The majority of the submissions that I was required to review were one and the same document (that is, exactly the same, not one word changed).  Because I had to report them for plagiarism, this also meant that they don't count towards the total no. of peer reviews completed, meaning it's extremely difficult to finish the course and earn the certificate, as there are really no genuine submissions at all it seems. (The few I did manage to complete were mostly just copied and pasted from the internet).  Pessimal experience, and the same goes for the related courses - Hypothesis-Driven Development, Agile Analytics and Agile Meets Design Thinking.  A​lso, if you alert Coursera to this and / or ask how to complain, the 'customer help service' just repeats the same thing over and over regarding the plagiarism function and ignores the complaint request outright, every single time. In my opinion this is disgusting for a course that is this expensive. ​ Save yourself some time and hassle - best avoided.  ",0,0,Laura Wallis,101060438
