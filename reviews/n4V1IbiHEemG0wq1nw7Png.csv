It is  quite challenging but I finally achieved it.  The course  is very practical with good case studies and exercises, the R  is an enhancement tool for my professional job as  a black belt of six sigma.  Thanks to Professor Martin for the great support to answer the questions while got problems with the r programming.  ",0,0,Zhaoyang Liu,33146330
