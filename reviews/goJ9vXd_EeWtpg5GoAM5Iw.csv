38356519~COURSE!~goJ9vXd_EeWtpg5GoAM5Iw,1641661044883,1,0,"Unfortunately this course is clearly not quality checked. Week 2 and 3 both have errors for both assignments. 

Week 2 

You get given this ""Assume you are a magazine editor and discover that one of your journalists has committed plagiarism. Write at least one paragraph (at least 50 words) describing how your news organization should handle such a situation. 1) discuss how you would deal with the journalist, acting as their editor/supervisor.""

All well and good but then you get the two following boxes

""Did the learner, acting in the role of an editor, discuss how they would rectify the plagiarism incident with the magazine's audience?""

""What do you think of their responses to deal with the plagiarism? Do they work? Not work? Please explain...""

Both are clearly made for the person giving feedback for writing in but you the learner can type in them and the person giving feedback can only tick yes or no and not write anything at all. 

Week 3 is a total joke. 

""The learner's response should reflect both an awareness of ethical standards and the need to treat news sources with respect.""
&
""Is the reasoning the learner provided logical, practical, and understandable? Explain.""

Again both clearly made for the person giving feedback for writing in but you the learner can type in them and the person giving feedback can only tick yes or no and not write anything at all. How this course is rated so highly without being quality-checked is beyond me. Passing this course as it currently is worthless as it's full of errors. ",0,1,Roberto Solomita,38356519
