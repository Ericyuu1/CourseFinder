90363929~COURSE!~236umrjFEee3pwoql1lO6A,1627252526576,1,0,"W​hen I enrolled this course, I didn't I was about to be explained about football nor that the questions of the tests could have been that badly phrased. I mean, when I am asked ""can I reconfigure the FPGA without stopping it from doing calculations"", as far as I am concerned, I always proceeded that way with two Terasic boards I worked with. I mean, I don't have to power them off and flash them. Then if we think about what happens in internal and with the JTAG bus, it is another thing.O​ther point, most of the articles/papers I was invited to read were on the IEEE website and they required me to be part of an organisation and to provide loads of credentials. I mean, when one wants to subscribe to a training, I hardly think that he/she wants to be sent to loads of websites and make one inscription per website. The articles should have been available directly on the platform.N​ot serious!",0,1,Gui llaume,90363929

A general description of the low-level configuration details of FPGAs, to the bitstream composition and configuration registers. A view on how CAD frameworks evolved through the years. This is done to show how fast the technology is evolving and the rationale behind the choice made to improve the users' experience when working with an FPGA-based system. I really recommend this course. Finally, I would like to thank Professor Marco d. Santambrogio for his effort and Coursera for the opportunities it gives to students, engineers, researchers and even hobbyists who are passionate about the field.  ",0,0,Khalid JOULID,39152484

I would say just one negative thing, which is about the big number of offered research papers in the reading section of every week. The issue is, students as beginners in this field would be lost and unmotivated because they are not able to read that much of papers which might lead them to think that they are not going to acquire the desired knowledge of this course.I would say that if the instructor would to choose some papers that are direct and easy for beginners would be way much better for learners.
