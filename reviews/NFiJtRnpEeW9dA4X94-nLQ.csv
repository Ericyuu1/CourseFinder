Getting basic examples to run is sometimes impossible. I'm literally talking about the most basic examples copied and pasted straight from this class. 2.) The moderators do not interact or help when it comes to finding work-arounds for the broken code libraries provided. Many people have posted with regards to these problems, yet no one ever gets a response.3.) This is the third course in a 4 course specialization on OOP. I am on week 11 in this specialization, and so far very little has been mentioned about OOP concepts. We are using OOP concepts, but without explanation. Every once in a while, a key word is thrown in, but never explained. The whole course is literally a professor telling you what code to copy and paste into your own program. When complete, you run the program and it works like they told you it would (well duh, they tell you exactly what to write). The course is garbage. I'm going to finish it because I've payed a couple hundred dollars at this point and I want the certificate. However, I will be posting any and everywhere to let people know not to waste their money.

39886634~COURSE!~NFiJtRnpEeW9dA4X94-nLQ,1660351827516,2,0,"This course reminds me why software engineering is so dry and boring. I took the first two courses with Duke University where they did very little to spoonfeed the code. They gave helper code but majority of the classes were written from scratch by the programmer. There is a satisfaction in that. You really get to write your own code so to speak and understand it and debug it.C​oming to the UCSD methodolgy, it's more of fill in the blanks with so many hints that you feel like your creativity is stifled. Half the work goes in setting up Eclipse and where the Map library is referencing the underlying source (protip: Don't use the google map source). I think they have conflated complex projects with enjoyable learning material. UCSD profs if you're reading this, don't focus so much on making a large project with multiple moving parts, focus first on the fact that students actually get the basics down through programming the assignments.The lectures are super easy to understand but the project really builds no intuition on how to tie the lecture material (this is what real world software engineering seems like...write very little code, read more of other people's code).T​l;Dr - If you're coming from Duke's courses this is a downgrade and frankly, just tedious. Duke should have stuck with it through all four courses and UCSD should probably look more into what makes programming fun (writing it; not reading it).

Also, the course is unnecessarily spread out for the actual amount it teaches. I think the entire course can be summarized in two weeks of materials. I would say that only week4-5-6 are important to understanding OOP. While the videos are good, some sections are pointless.

Nonetheless, I decided to give it a try and it did not disappoint me. Many bad reviews about this course complained about the old library and version of Java used. I agree it was a problem, but I was able to solve it within an hour.This course focuses on OOP, particularly on the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism in OOP, and how to use these concepts to solve real-world problems by implementing them as interfaces and inheritance, which makes the implementation more flexible and generic. The lecturer does not explicitly teach how to apply these concepts to real-world scenarios, but the provided code for each weekly assignment was implemented using these concepts, and by reading and solving the assignments, you will learn how to apply them and what they mean.In summary, I have learned a lot of useful things about OOP in this course despite the use of outdated technology. I think it does not really matter because I want to learn the concepts, not new technology, through this course. However, one downside is that there is no mentor, and you have to learn by yourself.

I especially liked Christine's and Mia's presentations. The videos on memory models were really great and helped me a lot. The assignments were really interesting too as they collected and mapped real time data of earthquakes onto a map, but some of the external libraries being used in UnfoldingMaps could have been explained a little better as to what their implementations were. In the beginning it was a little confusing trying to figure out the superclasses even though the Javadocs for them were available. I also felt that the Interaction Design Lab in Germany - the folks who implemented the UnfoldingMaps could have made the Javadocs of their classes a little more detailed. Further explanation of how to use the classes built into the course would have been very helpful. Hence the 4/5 stars given.

The lectures are very good, I think that the teachers are excellent expositors  but I feel that they could be more detailed. The project is about representing earthquakes in a map and you are always increasing the complexity. Finally you need to add your own extension which I found an excellent opportunity to test your imagination and your capacity to create new things. The only cons of the course for me is the way assignments are evaluated. I think it has to do with the fact that they are interactive. You have to answers questions in a Quiz related to the week content and the project. But the are not very demanding, therefore they do not reflect how much you really know.

The use of 'unfolding maps' and processing is a really good choice, and though I won't be using 'unfolding maps' in the future (it's kind of outdated and isn't used in the field), I gained a lot of insight into how geodata is used and was easily able to apply what I'd learned using other map platforms.As for object oriented programming, you couldn't ask for a better way to convey the material.

1487796~COURSE!~NFiJtRnpEeW9dA4X94-nLQ,1449283926267,5,0,"This is course is really awesome and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested to Software Engineering using JAVA programming Language.A little history about my background will help understand my excitement about this course. I am a newly graduated in the field of Electrical Engineering. So far, I wrote code mainly in C++ and I have not really participated to very challenging programming assignments. Looking for job (Unluckily so far ) I quickly realize that Java programming is really big on the job market. For these reasons, I got this book in Java programming called ""Starting Out with JAVA"", but may be due to lack of discipline I was not really able to move deeply in book. However since I have enrolled in this course, I am being influenced tremendously by the design of the class.I got so much positive vibe from the professor who make this class really exciting. The level of details use in lecture videos make this class really easy to follow. In addition, the class assignment are just plainly cool, practical, and challenging. I really feel like I am learning from expert in the field. This fact has raised my confidence that my gaining the skills combined in this specialization I magnify my qualification on the job market.Thank you.",0,3,Roussel Kamaha,1487796
