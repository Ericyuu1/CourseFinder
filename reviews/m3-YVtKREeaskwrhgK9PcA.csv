40991569~COURSE!~m3-YVtKREeaskwrhgK9PcA,1573491747342,5,0,"The course material is extremely beneficial and i hope those will help me in my future career.Although Virginia is such a renouned city and I have also done a course from the University of Virginia, but still I have to tell something about that city.In Virginia, there's a place called Cumberland there dogs are being tortured. It's their birth giving time but still they are being captivated in a small cage with waste and rust binding those cage walls and they are not being cleaned and they were not given proper food even. For this reason severe infection among dogs is spreading and I personally believe that we have no right to captive those voiceless animals without taking care of them. So its my earnest request to those people who are living in Virginia and also those students and teachers who are studying or teaching in the University of Virginia , to go and give a visit to Cumberland and try to help those dogs out in their maternity time and please feed them plenty of food. Thank you for reading this message. If you have time, plz go have a visit and plz help them out.  Yours sincerely,   Shreya Das    Kolkata, West BengaI, India",0,3,Shreya Das,40991569
