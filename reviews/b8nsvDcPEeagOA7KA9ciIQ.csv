53466299~COURSE!~b8nsvDcPEeagOA7KA9ciIQ,1618517284621,1,0,"I did not enjoy this course. I felt the topics were extremely interesting, yet I felt that the course was Global Health through an American perspective, with limited information on any other international key players in the field.  Secondly, a big problem is that the course is not updated and most of the articles and readings are no longer available or outdated. Lastly, if you plan to obtain a certificate, know that you need 3 peer reviews, and as this course is not so popular nowadays, so these are nearly impossible to obtain without having to beg for other people to review your assignment on the discussion forum. If you have the opportunity to take another course in this field I would recommend you do so.",0,1,Jessica Hubbers,53466299

4831003~COURSE!~b8nsvDcPEeagOA7KA9ciIQ,1516034678680,2,0,"It looked really interesting, but I was wrong. The videos are explained in a very boring way, the American focus is too present (I expected a more worldwide focus, even when she is explaining international organisations and world funds the American focus does not fade away) and the Gates Foundation spam is too much to handle (and yes, we all know that she worked there, she reminds us that every single week). Besides, many links do not work anymore and the final assessement task was too much for a self-employed like me who has to work every day more than 10h (weekends included, perks of being self-employed). It could be a great course but it has become the most boring course I have ever taken in Coursera and the only one I regret paying for. Unfortunately, a huge disappointment which I did not enjoy as much as I wished. ",0,1,Arnau G,4831003
51655180~COURSE!~b8nsvDcPEeagOA7KA9ciIQ,1595120327103,4,0,"Global health diplomacy is an important strategy yet there aren't many resources to learn about it. This course is a great introduction to the basics and the players. The instructor is knowledgeable and experienced. The course would be stronger if the lectures had slides to reinforce the most important information. Also, there are a number of errors (typos) in the quizzes. They need to be reviewed and corrected. The course is somewhat outdated but it is still quite useful. ",0,0,Pamela Marcus,51655180

26110922~COURSE!~b8nsvDcPEeagOA7KA9ciIQ,1499497970299,4,0,"Ultimately, it is very consistent, well-reasoned and logical course, but I mark this course with 4 stars and not 5 stars, because the barrier of assignments is very high, stands for 80% either for quizzes, as well as, what is the most important, for the last peer-graded assignment. It is even harder to earn honor certificate, because of that 80% of points' barrier. However, I recommend this course to those, who are keen on diplomacy and global health issues and, generally, love to work hard. And lastly, I want to admit, that the performer professor of this course is very interactive and engaging and it is very pleasant.",0,0,Beka Katsitadze,26110922
