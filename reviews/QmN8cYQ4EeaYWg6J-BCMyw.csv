In most cases the other students take their responsibilities and try to do a decent job of grading, but there are some students who have no idea what they are doing when it comes to grading assignments, and there are some students who seem to be downright malicious in their grading.  One student in particular ended up grading two of my assignments, and did such a bad job of it that I had to complain to Coursera.  Coursera's attitude was ""tough luck,"" and refused to do anything to help me out on that issue.  Because of that horrible experience, I decided to drop the course.

There are too many verbs as some points and not enough practice for them. At the same time, the grammar videos are too short and do not really contain much explanation. Even the examples are too simple then the exercises do not correspond to the simplicity of those examples. With the submission of the peer reviewed assignments that carry much weight (grades), it would be helpful to have some kind of way to record through the page so that the peers can have access to those audio recordings easily and therefore, the student gets the grade that they deserve.

56301913~COURSE!~QmN8cYQ4EeaYWg6J-BCMyw,1589359057449,3,0,"1. This course did not provide much focus on speaking skills and pronunciation, but the mandatory peer-graded assignments evaluated the learners on how well other fellow learners understand their vocabularies and pronunciation, which I found quite unfair and very subjective. Evaluation of speaking skills should not have been worth as much as 5 points out of 22, or at least shouldn't have been done through such a poorly designed, heavily subjective question. This is an online, beginner level Spanish class that only lasted the maximum of 3 weeks, the fact that near perfect pronunciation was expected is highly unrealistic. I spent a decade trying to speak understandable English to native English speakers, to expect fellow beginner level, non-native Spanish speakers to understand 100% of my speeches in a course that I only spent 1 week to complete is unreasonable. 2. Peer-graded assignment submission template should be easier to understand to prevent people from accidentally failing to submit their assignment with a valid link to their video/audio records.3.

30434276~COURSE!~QmN8cYQ4EeaYWg6J-BCMyw,1520913653040,3,0,"Generally speaking I think the course content is good, but I rated this course average because of three main reasons.1).  I think a little more effort to organize the material would go a long way.  For example, the grammar presentations refer to new vocabulary words that were not introduced in the vocabulary list, and the vocabulary exams refer to content in the grammar section. It would be nice if the curriculum were designed so that you could study the vocabulary, take the vocabulary exam, then review the grammar and leverage what you learned in the vocabulary section to re-enforce your learning.2).  I also think that some of the topics deserve additional clarifications, and the presentations themselves are very short.  I appreciate the length of the presentations when reviewing the presentations to refresh my memory, but difficult concepts sometimes require more attention than they are given.  In some cases, it seems as though an elegant choice of words to describe a difficult concept is more important than taking the time to deconstruct that concept into simple phrases.3).  Lastly, there are errors in the presentations and exams, and little to no involvement from the professor to clarify points and/or correct those issues.  I have noticed comments from students who have reported the same issues for the past two years, and those issues are still not corrected.  I used to comment on the message boards for clarifications and to report errors, but after getting zero responses from the professor I stopped participating.Conclusion:Overall, I think it's a good course - it provides a good structure for learning the Spanish language despite the above shortcomings.  Although they appear very simple to address, I see the same shortcomings exhibited by every course in the series.",0,13,Bryan Chin,30434276
