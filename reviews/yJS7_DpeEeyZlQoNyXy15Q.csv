68152746~COURSE!~yJS7_DpeEeyZlQoNyXy15Q,1644993820703,1,0,"Unlike other courses and guided projects I've taken, this one does not include a spreadsheet with all of the data we need. We are required to type everything up on our own spreadsheet. This was a little annoying, but I still would have stuck with it becasue the information was useful. However, the instructor seemed to be unaware of the fact that we are trying to follow along in a split screen mode. When it was time to work on a new sheet, we had to type everything up on a new worksheet, but her information was not visible. She needs to scroll over on her sheet so we can see her sheet and type on ours at the same time. I wish this class would have been set up properly. I ended up leaving the project to look for something better.",0,0,VAH2112,68152746

It seems that the instructor did not update this project after they prepared the data file for learners to use.For learners who do not know where the data file is: First, follow the instruction login your Microsoft account in the cloud workplace.Second, go to OneDrive.Third, click upload file. You will probably see there is a file for you to upload to your OneDrive. That file is the data file.Fourth, open the data file and continue the lesson.",0,0,WONG Sze Yeuk,69546350
