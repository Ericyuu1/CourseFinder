For example, in the 4th and 5th milestones, using R was a little tricky because I forgot most of the commands and had to go back to learn.

I am offered to extend  the course, which means that I will not receive my certificate for another 3 months more and will have to wait for the next start of the course. This is unacceptable, the course is paid every month, I am happy to study and do all the work on time, but they are not checked! I ask you to understand this situation and give me the opportunity to complete this course and get a Certificate, and not wait for the next course, which will end only in mid-January. I started work in September!",0,6,Anastasia Arefyeva,76662060
