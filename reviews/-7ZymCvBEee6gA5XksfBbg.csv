Many topics are explained clearly, with valuable field practitioners insight, and you are given quizzes and code-exercises that help deepen the understanding of how to implement the concepts in the videos. I would recommend to take them after the initial Andrew Ng ML course by Stanford, unless you have prior background in this topic.There are a few shortbacks:1 - the video editing is poor and sloppy. Its not too bad, but it’s sometimes can be a bit annoying.2 - most of the exercises are too easy, and are almost copy-paste. I need to go over them and create variations of them in-order to strengthen my practical skills. Some exercises are quite challenging though (especially in course 4 and 5), and I need to go over them just to really nail them down, as things scale up quickly. Course 3 has no exercises as its more theoretical. Some exercises have bugs - so make sure to look at the discussion board for tips (the final exercise has a huge bug that was super annoying).3 - there are no summary readings - you have to (re)watch the videos in order to check something, which is annoying. This is partially solved because the exercises themselves usually hold a lot of (textual) summary, with equations.4 - the 3rd course was a bit less interesting in my opinion, but I did learn some stuff from it. So in the end it’s worth it. Not sure I would have taken it as a stand-alone course, though.5 - Slide graphics and Andrew handwriting could be improved. 6 - the online Coursera Jupyter notebook environment was a bit slow, and sometimes get stuck. Again overall - highly recommended",0,3,D. Refaeli,19165148

(2) The course went over some interesting topics in a very high-level way, but skipped a lot of the details that would have been very interesting to people looking to learn deep learning in depth (like the target audience of this course!). (3) While I think the approach of having some themed case studies for the test is neat, a lot of the answers left me thinking ""well, the correct answer would also depend on X which isn't specified"". Good concept to test knowledge in a ""discussion/oral exam"" session, but IMHO bad for hard ""wrong or right"" multiple choice tests.(4) Some videos had ""black screen"" times at the end, errors, cut-offs and repetitions were not cut out, and overall I think this had the least amount of ""polishing"" of the courses in this specialization so far.I'd have preferred if the content of this course were a bit more steamlined and merged it into the other courses of this specialization.",0,0,Felix Eggert,27684585

14805531~COURSE!~-7ZymCvBEee6gA5XksfBbg,1600019228365,4,0,"In my opinion this course is an important part of the specialization. But a number of issues made it fall short of a five star rating.First the positives: Of the three courses I've taken so far, the quizzes showed great creativity, which made learning fun. Well done.  Unapologetically this course does not require students to write a single line of code. Instead it necessarily addresses issues that coders and their managers need to consider. It's not 'fluff,' but real decision points for machine learning applications. So I found this course of value for the specialization. Here's what keeps it from five stars.I think that there ought to be mini-quizzes at the end of every lecture so as to reinforce learning, rather than once at the end of 10 to 12 videos.This course is probably the right place in the specialization to include a section on the shortfalls of machine learning. So far the specialization takes the perspective of happy technicians solving the world's problems through machine learning. I think it appropriate to spend some time on how machine learning caused such a grading problem during COVID-19 (in the UK and for the International Baccalaureate), how thousands in state employment can skew results by data input and the like. Finally, as a small but jarring note - can't somebody re-edit some of the videos? Having audio repeated, hearing ""test test,"" and microphone problems are shortcomings not expected from a course that endeavours to teach professionals. Overall four stars.

The only downside is that the programming exercises are little too easy in my opinion. I feel like the best way to get your hands dirty is to do actual projects (do your own projects).

I am a working professional (13+ years), but just getting into the field of ML and AI.  Apologies for flashing this preamble for every course that I review on coursera.This course is the third in the deeplearning.ai series offered by Dr. Andrew Ng.  This is a relatively short course as compared to the other courses in this series.  However, there are quite a few videos to watch and learn from.  This course is really a series of practical advice, strategies and analysis techniques that are an indispensable part of the ML/DL toolbox of a practitioner.  The techniques are presented through a series of examples and Dr. Ng helps beat the ""practical theory"" into the student very well.  I was at first disappointed that there were no programming proects.  However, the ""flight simulator"" quizzes were quite challenging and made me think -- thereby, more than made up for the absense of projects. This course is a critical part of the entire series and it is best understood when taken as a part of the sequence.Thanks Dr. Ng and teaching assistants.  This is a fantastic course.

It appears to have no technical details and I can see some people may consider this course worthless or make disparaging remarks. But based on my personal experience, what he taught in this class is really important and kind of shapes the way one needs to think about how to tackle a machine learning project from the start. As researchers and engineers, it's easy for us to delve into the technical details and algorithm approaches, papers too early when the overall direction is not too clear yet. I feel very grateful for what Andrew did by sharing his knowledge to all of us.PS: I believe the content taught in Course 3 is also similar to Andrew's recent NIPS tutorial: Nuts and Bolts of Building Applications using Deep Learning.

I've gotten much more than I've expected at the beginning. Not only deeply understand how the neural network works, but also how to build deep neural network and how to train it efficiently. Now I know how to start to build a machine learning project and solve the specific problems from data preparation to model training and I know how to quickly get my network works through transfer learning and fine-tuning, etc. By watching the interview videos I got a lot about the future of AI and I deeply know what I am really interested in now. I really appreciate what Prof. Andrew and TAs have done to make this series available from all around the world and I really too impatient to wait to learn the next two course.

Join and it will make you more curious to dig dipper and also at same time making you better than some of real experts in the industry. ",0,0,kunal singh,22546799

Besides the content of the video lectures, which are a must-see for every ML practitioner, I particularly liked the ""flight simulator""-style assignments. Although the content is of very high quality, I noted that there a couple of mistakes in the assignment texts, unfortunately sometimes even in the options of multiple-choice questions, which make it unnecessarily hard to guess what the option actually means. In one case (assignment 2, question 10) I even think the ""correct"" answer's text is contradictory to what Andrew says in the lecture. I feel that half an hour of proof-reading could have taken care of these mistakes.",0,0,Michael Koepf,4954857
