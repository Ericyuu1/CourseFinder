104567111~COURSE!~YO9_vwpyEeun9Q5tylnU9Q,1669823847536,1,0,"Course lecture videos give good conceptual overview, but it was very difficult to connect these concepts to the homework assignments. I spent much longer than the recommended time on the assignments as there was little support from the course instructors. Wouldn't recommend this course to a friend.",0,0,Nate Stephenson,104567111

So you must send your work without knowing if you are in the good direction and you only have 5 tries... A​lso, nobody answer you when you're stuck somewhere, the staff team seems to be inexistant.",0,0,Thierry Ksstentini,94104241

It's not a course to learn things from scratch, furthermore it would be difficult to apply knowledge from notebooks elsewhere if you aren't experienced. I wish about an assignment about GNN / GANS / VAE, all these things are interesting but only briefly covered. I've never heard of Graph Neural Network. Well, every neural network actually is a graph, didn't know it's a separate kind of network.",0,0,Ernest Warzocha,1427998
