57819885~COURSE!~TxrgOYqvEeaIrA7v8VIl-Q,1652125533060,1,0,"My formal education is in engineering but not specifically in systems engineering. I am about to start a job as a senior systems engineer after accumulating work experience. I took both the introduction to systems engineering course from University of Buffalo and this MBSE course in order to start developing a more formal background. The MBSE course was not helpful. I learned close to nothing. I took away only a single page of notes. For comparison, I wrote 17 pages for the intro course from University of Buffalo. The reason why this course is unhelpful is that weeks 2 and 3 come off as a sales pitch for systems engineering. I do not need half the course to convince me that systems engineering is useful. Most people who are interested in systems engineering understand that already. I wanted to learn specific approaches and techniques that I can use to be a better systems engineer. There are no in-depth use cases covered in this course. I would suggest that the instructors rework the course to include various example projects and go in detail on exactly what a systems engineer might do from beginning to end of the product lifecycle. This way, we can get a sense for how to utilize MBSE tools and for how different tools might be better suited to different projects/enterprise scales (e.g. small medical device vs large aerospace vs medium software company).",0,0,Sunny Kapadia,57819885

I also really enjoyed the ""guest speaker"" Prof. Long who was clearly a very knowledgeable professional on systems engineering and MBSE.
