17035374~COURSE!~XDC_NbfLEeS4lSIAC1AIDw,1672070798878,2,0,"The peer marking system is terrible. Basically to get the completion certificate, four compulsory assignments have to be completed, which is fine. The problem is that each must be marked by at least three other students, so your completion status basically depends on the number of students who enrolled with you.Since there haven't been enough peer markers for my work, I have not been able to complete the course despite already finishing the course content. Due to the need for peer marking, my first assignment has been marked ""Overdue"" too, even though I had actually submitted it well in advance of the due date. There's an obvious issue if students cannot get the certification that they have paid for, even though they have already submitted all their work on time.The course content is interesting but I would have liked more links between the different parts of the course. For example, it would have been good if the teachers covered the link between multimodal learning and learning that takes into account student social identities. These are covered as separate parts of the course but I felt there wasn't enough integration between the different parts.",0,1,Zhengwen Lu,17035374

I fully support the words of the maintainers and hope that in the near future more people will study multimodal literacy. Knowing the main aspects of it, people can not only improve and speed up the quality of learning or learning any information, but also make the connections between each other stronger.
