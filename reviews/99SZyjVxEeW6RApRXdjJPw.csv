17444867~COURSE!~99SZyjVxEeW6RApRXdjJPw,1628761671560,4,0,"This whole specialization is not  Product Management but is really a course in software Project Management. Content on building a product strategy and roadmap is limited to some (albeit very useful) frameworks on prioritisation, but does not go beyond this.But the biggest failure of the course is the lack content on customer insight. The one module that covers this simply suggests to ask the CEO - not a single mention is made of talking to an end user, or even prototyping! Other vital skills of a Product Manager beyond shipping the initial product are ignored. Product data analytics and iteration are barely mentioned. Where data analytics is mentioned, the focus is on does the product work as designed, rather than does it actually meet the goals of the business. The course seems designed for someone working for a rather unimaginative consultancy, where you build what the client tells you, and wipe your hands clean as soon as that is done. This does not match any of my experience working in-house as a Product Manager. The focus is very firmly on building the product right, with little attention given to building the right product. However, as a course in Software Project Management, the content is great, and I found this course to be extremely useful. But please don't go away thinking this is all that a Product Manager does, and I'd strongly suggest taking other courses on customer insights, prototyping and product data analytics to build up your skills across everything that being a Product Manager involves.

1. About what I have learned   There a lot of things from 
concepts to practical exercises. I believe the Agile and its concepts 
while development processes were a highlight and the last course about  
Metrics was other great too.  I think to speak a little bit more about 
Scrum and Kanban could be a great benefits for the next learners.   
Another point is about the needed to have more video bring a deep 
guidance ""how to do"" some artifacts as burndown chart, unit test, and so
 on.2. My favorite parts   The capstone project was a the 
best course experience where each all artifacts were developed using the
 concepts learned before.3. Overall experience    I can really 
say it is great and I recommend the specialization because of the 
material quality (quiz, papers, tests, and so on).   I had a concern
 about peer reviews because some times there are no one to review my job
 and when there are some points to fix or to improve unfortunately the 
feedback was gave almost deadline.. 4. Improvements...      I
 think to talk about DevOps into Agile Practices is needed today. So, I 
have as suggestion to add this subject in the course Agile process and 
Metrics as well to explore a little bit more about Scrum as well other 
agile methodologies.

It helped me to switch from a theoretical mode to an IRL mode where you can really understand the concepts when in a realistic context. I’m very excited to apply what have learn here in my job. It’s also great to have managed to cover almost all the items studied during the specialisation. Not only that really help to assimilate each concept but it also put each concept in perspective in a realistic time line. Thank you for taking extra effort to tune the difficulty level in order to make accessible for part time student. Nevertheless a good understanding the course content is mandatory and sometime several assignment submissions will help you to keep it in your mind. Even though a lot of effort have certainly been put in the exam quizzes, sometimes submissions get blocked and that's very frustrating. I can understand the technical constraints and when your assignment is freeze for a couple of days that's not a problem. But when it is blocked for more than 2 weeks that is really a pain and it's quite annoying not to be able to get in touch with a tutor or a technical contact. Thanks to your willingness to create some kind of community around this specialisation, it solved partially the lack of professor feedback! It was pleasant to recognised fellow learners across exams and feedback. I didn't have time to spend on forum nevertheless I felt as a part of a whole. You really manage to create a good balance between video, reading and exercises.

learned a lot, and as a result I feel confident and look forward to applying
this corpus of knowledge to my next job.Thank you to the team who has put these all together. Thank you also to the
peer students. I learned quite a bit by reading some of the contributions.The assignments are practical even though some are too much (and very well) prepared (to make our life easier). They
have helped me get immersed in the actual role of a project manager. As a
matter of fact, I am using some of what we have learned on a personal project;
I wrote user stories and could see how powerful and useful they were to discuss
with the developers. Then, I kept the rhythm of sprints in my mind to pace the
velocity of the project and the developers' works. I am super satisfied I enrolled. There were aspects I already knew or had
similar knowledge, coming from an engineering background. But I am a novice
when it comes to the process of building a software. The whole set up,
especially the simulations have helped me gain practical insights on 'the how'
all these come together. The role plays are invaluable. The testimonies
(interviews) of professionals of the industry are invaluable. It is like a
concentrated internship, and even, not all internships teach you as much.At the beginning I was skeptical with the peer grading exercise. The quality
of feedback and discussions is variable but all in all, I like it when co-learners are as eager to learn too and take the course seriously.
At the same time, this is the mere reflection of the real wold: people are in
it for different reasons.What could be done differently:Availability of course teachers/moderators. I saw that many questions from
students were left unanswered so that was a discouraging factor to post more
questions on the discussion portal.As is, the specialization is already very good. To take it to the next
improvement step, maybe keep it current and show it is current, responding to
or even anticipating industry needs.Last, a minor detail that did not get in the way of leaning: the delivery
(speech), the 'acting' in much of the courses and capstone is very natural,
very credible. When that was the case, it was enjoyable and made the learning
easier. Sometimes, the delivery was too fast, less easy to follow; but
fortunately the transcription was there to support... It is a question of
preference but offering both options (oral/video and written) is a big plus I
believe, and I am glad you do because it makes the specialization accessible to
many people in places around the world where internet access does not always
allow watching video easily. ",0,0,Andry Ralijaona,22079718

Also, Inukshuk stones representation is very good way, as I am visual type so that helps to connect modules.  Mentors for this socialization were really excellent in summarizing so many different practices and metrics and methodologies in such a small period of time. Small and frequent quizzes throughout video lessons are excellent to test yourself and to keep focus. Additional material provided for the course were also very informative and interesting read!

Also some times many days pass with your assignments in ""grading in process"" state.The metrics course need more practical assignments, because many people have problems with the burndown charts and the PDF was not enough, maybe a step by step video.

use of solar boats in the French Riviera, I wanted to learn about Software Management
Processes and Agile. I found in this Mook useful
learnings. Not only theoretical but also practices.I was impressed by the
quality of the training content. There are 3 levels of MCQ during the videos,
after the module and after the courses. Most of the questions are different, you never
have the feeling of copy pastes. This is a lot of work I imagine. The peer
review is a great concept both for having a feedback from your peers and for
learning from the other works. The videos
were high quality, even with interactive videos trees.The only
issue is on the peer reviews for the course 6. As I progressed there were less
peers work available for my correction. As a consequence, it took more time to
get the certification despite the fact I already finished the specialization.Bravo to

2000874~COURSE!~99SZyjVxEeW6RApRXdjJPw,1477942902707,5,0,"I think it was a wonderful experience.  I liked the theory introduction of Course 1 when we learned about the Agile Manifesto and we have been teach why processes, requirements, planning and monitoring matter. Personally, it was a nice review for what I have learned in my mastering and, earlier, when taking my Bachelor’s degree.I also enjoyed the Course 2, specially when it came to Agile methodologies explanation. I learned many things about Lean and Scrum practices that I hadn’t known or I hadn’t remembered by that time.Course 3 is, by far, the one I enjoyed and learned more. In my mastering thesis I used a lot of usability techniques, I also studied many of these and I kinda enjoyed the way wireframes were emphasized. The exercise to draw a wireframe was awesome. It was really fun to do it and check what my colleagues did. It was also nice to learn about user stories standards and acceptance tests, I am using a lot of what we learned in my current job.Course 4 was cool, too. I liked to see many techniques working together, such as WBS, User Story points, Pert Charts and so on. However, I felt a little bit lost when I was taking the course, not knowing exactly where was the exact place of each technique. I am very experienced with project management, so it was not that hard, but I was wondering about my colleagues who were seeing these subjects for, maybe, the first or second time in their lives. I think it could be the most tiring course, even though the topics were pretty important and very well explained.Course 5 was a good one. It’s not everybody who gives attention to monitoring and retrospectives. As far as retrospectives is concerned, it was really nice to learn every step we should go over in this kind of meeting. I have been working in this field for a while and I have never seen a project retrospective taking place, so it was nice to learn about this and realize it could work if we put some energy on it.Course 6. The Capstone Project. It was amazing. By far the best course of these six. Every week was pretty good, with a good amount of scenarios and practices. I loved the “RPG” style of the simulations, also, it was really nice going over each sprint, checking, working and changing the plans accordingly. You guys from Alberta rocked, as far as this capstone is concerned.I wish you could put more of this kind of practice along the whole course. Sometimes the exercises of the courses 1 to 5 were too much theoretical, so it would be nice to see this kind of “capstone scenario applied to that”. Also, I think it would be nice to take a “Capstone Part 2” course where other problems could arise and we can face harder practices. I noticed as you guys from Alberta that the forum was a little bit quiet. I think one way to make it more active is to put the students in situations that they are not so sure about, so they will be “obligated” to discuss. I think this “advanced capstone” could do that. This is my suggestion, I hope you think about it!Finally, it was a pleasure to be with you and learn everything I learned. I don’t regret that I decided to take the whole specialization. Also, i want to say thank you all my colleagues who spent time checking my answers and my mistakes. I learned a lot from you too, guys!",0,13,Alexandre Rivaben Justino,2000874
