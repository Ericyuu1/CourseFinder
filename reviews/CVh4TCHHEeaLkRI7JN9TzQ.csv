The name of the course is misleading it is ""introduction to GIS mapping"" but without ""GIS"". in the entire course only 1 or 2 videos show how to use GIS that is it (planting couple of trees on a Queens Park map.) 2. This is more about theory than practice. The instructor has very good hand of the theory which makes sense because his background is geography. 3. The course tells a lot about 'what' to do but never shows 'how' to do it in GIS. 4. If you are looking to learn simple applications  such as change the color of 1 states on a US map to show where you are from, (basic skill) wont be able to do it! videos are good exmples are good explanations are good but no application aspect. 4. You ask for data used in lectures wont get it.  I guess i will fully use the trail period before paying in future for any course!",0,10,Shams Rahman,7565201

My software did not behave the same as depicted in the week three video. T​he assignment required a lot of self learning of the software and ALL of that self learning came from google and not course resources. I estimate I spent more than 30 hours trying to learn setup and the basic features of this software needed to do this work. The software is not intuitive so there needs to be much more explanation of the steps. For example, I now have separate folders for each 'layer'. These layers are referred to as layers in some 'help' inquiires and attributes in others. I have 30 years of computer experience in over 30 pieces of software, including some CADD but I still do not understand the basic file mangement protocol for this software. (I think my project actually  was drawing points, lines, and polygons from separate folders on my computer instead of one folder. Also, I was very disappointed I could not understand how to get items in my table to show labels on my image (many hours looking). My employment will not afford me this many hours to complete a project stated as a 4 hour project.

One request/thought that I have: perhaps consider providing downloadable or linked data for small practice projects. Many of my favorite tutorials - where I've learned the most by doing hands on, guided projects - provide learners with the basic data and then walk them through the steps. I know that we've been able to see walk-throughs in these videos - which is quite helpful - but actively doing small, buildable projects oneself is a way to solidify that learning. And, while I get the sense that being able to find accurate, reliable, and usable data is a huge skill and portion of the work within GIS, being an introductory student and trying to make your first maps with data that might be incomplete, less than helpful, or even impossible to download in the first place can be quite frustrating and makes for difficult practice.
