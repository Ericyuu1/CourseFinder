End of specialization. After ending it I feel that I can use the manufacture tools in Fusion 360 but it lacks the ""hardware"" part of explanations and after watching the end there are more questions than answers. I which the the specialization would show comparison between parameters and tools on real CNC machine not only virtual because some benefits of functions would be self-explanatory.",0,0,Ernest Warzocha,1427998
