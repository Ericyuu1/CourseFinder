Here are my recommendations: (1) instructors and techs should be wearing gloves during the virtual lab demos. It is unacceptable to perform experiments without them. (2) Jonathan Agger - very organized lectures but quizzes were above the difficulty of the material presented. (3) Michael Anderson - lectures required organization and the background noises were not conducive to a learning environment. His quizzes require work as some questions were repetitive and the difficulty level was too low. (4) Patrick O'Malley - lectures are decent but can be faster if presented in a pre-written slide format. Quizzes were pedagogical. (5) Lectures should follow Dr. Agger's format and quizzes Dr. O'Malley format. ,0,0,Carlos Valle,112501091
