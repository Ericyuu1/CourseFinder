To be honest, I had the least expectations before I began the course, partly due to the fact that I do not enjoy participating in any discussions that involve organization politics let alone exercise those tactics myself. But my perceptions totally changed after listening to the Just World Fallacy lecture. Throughout the course, you get to understand why - although often you do not like to use the influence tactics - you should still find ways to use them so as to achieve your end objectives or goals without compromising on your principles or valuesProfessor Cade Massey captivates the audience through his sufficiently-paced video lectures. Throughout the 4 modules, he uses examples, research studies, and data to objectively help us understand the key points/thoughts in using Influence Tactics. I have thoroughly enjoyed taking the Leverage Inventory and Hard Questions Survey. I also liked the way the professor presented facts after you take the survey to help understand where you stand or how you could improveI would highly recommend taking and completing this course if you are doing the Success course, as it is a logical add-on to help you craft an execution plan for what you would have envisioned for yourself in the Success course",0,1,Lavanya Yadlapalli,11957545

influence and power base. I also learned that I don’t need to become a new
individual to be more influential. I discovered tactics, dimensions and
principles that can guide my decisions to more effectively achieve goals. I
would highlight the important statement that “Effectiveness often requires
flexibility and compromise. Idealism is costly.”One of the precious principles Professor Cassey presents
is to “Look for the third way”, incentivizing us to find out more creative alternatives
to navigate into smart choices. Finally, I’m deeply connected with a closing thought
that will definitely inspire me on my future career and life challenges: “How
do you get people not only to follow their own passion but to create passion in
others and lead them in that way?” and this experience gave us tools to be
successful on it. ",0,1,Lais Pacini,83630017
