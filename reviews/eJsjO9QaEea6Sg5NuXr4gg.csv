A whole essay disappeared when I sent it and the support was not helpful at all. I had to write it again.It was not possible to work with the mobile version of the course, when the app had technical problems. The final assesment had to be limited to 5 pages, but no pages are counted in the submission field. Formats are not taken over, when copying a text from writing program. One has to do it all over again. Finally another participant told me my text had 10 pages instead of 5, when in open office and google docs it had 5 +first page and 2 pages references.Also for peer reviewing it is an uncomfortable format to reed. 2 of 3 peers did not give any critique but deducted points. If the passing of a program is linked to the competence of fellow participants i feel it is not worth a lot.Course contents were interesting, but at some points it felt very much as if certain brands had a sponsorship with the creators of this course.
