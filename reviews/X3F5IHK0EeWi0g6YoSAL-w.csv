601372~COURSE!~X3F5IHK0EeWi0g6YoSAL-w,1479668473883,1,0,"Very little of use in this course. A lot of academic mumbo jumbo that is totally useless when confronted with the infinite investment opportunities. The student is presented with a number of time consuming/wasting formulas to apply to the decision process. If one ACTUALLY used those formulas, one would still be waiting to buy the first stock. A question from the Week 4 test will demonstrate just how useless this course is:The Situation: ""You invested to maximize your wealth over a one year period. You are eagerly anticipating the returns after the first month.""The Question: ""What part of your brain is being activated?""What's Wrong with this?First of all, who invests in order to make it big in one year. You are trading if that is your goal.Second: who gives a flying fig about what part of the brain is engaged? What am I supposed to do with the answer? How does this, in the least, help me make better investment decisions. I'm done. I was going to take all the courses in this specialization. No more. Waste of time and money.",0,5,Tom Schaber,601372

Obviously this is to increase income for Coursera by extending the length of membership payment .. really not nice .. cheap way .. not professional !
