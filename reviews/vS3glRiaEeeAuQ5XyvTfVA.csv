It states that it is an introuduction to testing AND automation. But it turns out that is almost everything about automatio and you also crearly need a background on JAVA to be able to understand it. 
Lesson 1 to 3 are great and are actually about testing in general but from lesson 4 onward is all abuot code and very complicated stuff for begginers. I am sad to say I have wasted my time on this since there is no way I have the level to complete it and they don't care to explain anything to you.

Este curso tiene un muy buen contenido teórico pero un contenido práctico totalmente caótico. Si bien la mayoría de los exámenes de elección múltiple están relativamente bien, algunos de estos contienen preguntas sobre cosas que se explican en semanas posteriores, de manera tal que el examen de la semana 1 pregunta cosas que se explican en la semana 4. Pero eso no es nada comparado con los ejercicios de programación. En los ejercicios de la semana 1 y 4, ambos tienen un sistema de calificación que valida el código de forma muy rudimentaria. Ese sistema devuelve mensajes de error totalmente incomprensibles incluso para alguien que ya sabe programar. Las últimas dos tareas de la semana 4 devuelven errores aún completando a la perfección todo lo requerido. Leyendo el foro de comentarios, me enteré que algunas de esas tareas se aprueban haciendo cosas que no están explicadas en las tareas. Perdí muchas valiosas horas tratando de entender esto. En definitiva, tuve que subir algo ""mal hecho"" para aprobar los trabajos. Y creo que lo peor del curso es la tarea de la semana 3, donde piden hacer un Test Plan con varios requerimientos que no se explican en las clases (exigen hacer un diagrama Gantt y un diagrama PERT, cosas que no se explican en lo absoluto y que no hubiese aprobado si no fuera porque lo aprendí en la facultad). Muchos alumnos han volcado esta preocupación en los foros y ninguno de los docentes asignados a este curso ha respondido algo. Otra cosa que me fastidió es que mi TestPlan fue plagiado parcial y totalmente por dos alumnos que me tocó corregir, evidentemente porque no sabían como hacer la tarea. Finalmente, en mi opinión personal, creo que este curso debería durar como mínimo 6 semanas, ya que las últimas dos semanas exigen demasiadas cosas que apenas son tratadas en los cursos, con nulo soporte a los alumnos que tienen dificultades para seguir adelante. Desde ya, a cualquier persona que esté comenzando a aprender sobre Unit Testing , jamás le recomendaría este curso.",0,5,Javier Sorella,5094507

It got us involved in writing tests relatively early, which was good, but then dropped it for too long and loaded up at the end. The middle felt more like a soup of picayune questions, even though I appreciate the need to know the vocabulary. I would have liked to see the assignments sprinkled more in the middle of the class too.Writing a test plan was a valuable exercise. I think it would have been fairer to present the expectations/rubric before we submitted it. I was also stunned to see the same 2 versions of the assignments (The same 37 or 53 tests) handed in repeatedly by my peers. I believe Coursera needs to invest in turnitin.com or a similar product.I found it a drag to have to downgrade Java on my machine in order to make the assignments work. Also, Eclipse did not behave well, and I found myself needing to switch over to NetBeans. I would have liked to stick with VS Code, but that seems to work better with Maven than with Gradle.Overall, I find I now have the vocabulary to describe what I have been doing, a bigger picture of the testing endeavor, and some new specific skills like working with Jacoco and Mockito.
