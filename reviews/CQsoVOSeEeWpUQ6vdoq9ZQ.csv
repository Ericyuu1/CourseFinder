Besides, this course is no longer authoritative since there is no supervision over peer reviews. As a result, one can see people complaining getting random scores due to others' irresponsibility  and even malice in the forum and even online.",0,5,Xiaoping Min,8115330

At this point, it appears that this course has been abandoned.I doubt that there are many students who would work on this project. And as this is a peer-rated project, I have low hope that I can get enough peer reviews to earn a certificate. An unfortunate ending for an otherwise great specialization.",0,8,Vy Hong,445454

I felt very disappointed at this capstone project due to its little instruction. If students can learn everything by themselves from other online resources, what would be the meaning of creation of this course at all.",0,15,Emma Ding,10102496

The assignments are exceptionally challenging given that the instructors offer now actual instruction on how to perform them.  Two and a half days into the course not a single moderator has answered a question in the forums and I can't find a way to contact Coursera about this problem.I am very disappointed.  I was planning on taking additional courses through the Coursera platform, but now I am reconsidering.",0,17,Daren Thomas,18000898

32064868~COURSE!~CQsoVOSeEeWpUQ6vdoq9ZQ,1570022951379,4,0,"The two projects for this course are worthwhile learning experiences.  My issues with the course are not the content covered but rather the way the course is administered.  The course is apparently on auto-pilot with project grades coming from other students through peer review.  I don't see any evidence of any kind of instructor or course administrator activity.  In fact, if you search the discussion forums you will see students have reached out to the listed instructors in a variety of ways with no response.  Prospective students should also note that unlike all the other courses in the Cloud Computing Specialization, this course has an actual start.  The other courses can be taken at any time while this one starts on a specific date, so you may end up finishing the first 5 courses and then having to wait a couple of months to finish up the specialization.",0,5,Craig Knudsen,32064868
