They lack of a lot of basic knowledge and most questions asked will not get answered. There is no mentor for this class so be very careful when you start it. it means you have to teach yourself. It will be a great class for people who know javascript well just take it for a refresh, but not me as a learner. For example , new SimpleImage() is used all the time as a function but no explaination on this function. I feel very furstrated with this class. I was able to manage this class and pass it because i googled a lot of things, however in return my knowledge is very chopped not systematical.

I really felt like nobody reviewed the materials - at least not as thoroughly as they should have - and, as we all know, in programming if you can't find the error very soon you become really frustrated, especially if you're a beginner. You can imagine the overwhelming feeling when you realize that the error was in the instructions, the PowerPoint slides, or in the video, as a single period or comma can really bring unnecessary anxiety and waste a lot of the students' time. Of course we are all here to learn but I did expect more care in preparing those precious materials. To top this off, numerous times I had this feeling I missed an explanation then I would watch and re-watch the videos carefully, and still could not figure it out. I didn't know teaching 20% and asking for 60% in the assessments was supposed to be productive or bring good results. In programming you learn by practicing as long as it is properly directed. So, my advice to people who are considering this course is: be prepared to give your 110% because this course is way more demanding than advertised. And it isn't as interactive as it should. You really feel very lonely in the journey because you'll be spending nights by yourself trying to figure out where is the error in your code. Good news is the forums are full of people on the same boat and there will be a lot of help from other students - sometimes, unfortunately, the only way will be asking for a good soul to post their code, after trying it by yourself for hours to an end. Or maybe the error was in the instructions. All the same.  ",0,2,Max P. Y.,76429322

That's the only reason I took this course. I'll never understand that decision and it was a huge waste of my time (yes, I know I could've skipped this course, but I'm a completist and want the specialization certificate).2) The first two weeks were actually pretty good, but Week 3 is where the wheels fell off. The lectures and the assignments started to diverge tremendously. Its normally fine in education, even encouraged, to not give students all the answers and let them figure it out on their own, buts it incredibly frustrating to do this in coding languages since they are so precise, and also since Duke seems to want to use their own special library that you can't check. Some of the assignments had written out instructions with absolutely no clues on how they should be formatted in JavaScript. WHAT?! There's no way I can figure out code formatting on my own, especially with your special functions and library. Which brings me to point 3.3) I get why Duke uses a friendlier coding program with their own library, but it makes all the methods I've learned worthless in the real world. Why bother learning them if they don't exist anywhere else?Overall, I dreaded have to log-in and continue this course everyday.

Mentors don't respond in the forums anymore, and you used to need 3 other students to grade the work on the projects, but now you just mark it as done.  This means in theory you could get your cert without doing any of the projects, just by doing the quizzes, which you get multiple attempts on and feedback and clues for your wrong answers after each attempt.  In my mind, that makes the certificate much less meaningful.  Additionally, I spent large portions of the course feeling lost.  It's supposed to be a beginner course but it feels like the already expect you to have a fair amount of background knowledge.  They use jargon that a complete beginner might not understand, and I felt like they skipped over key concepts and expected you to figure them out.  This led to difficulty doing the coding assignments.

By the end, the projects are so laser-focused on pixel manipulation and Duke's own methods that it's hard to see how one might generalize this experience to JavaScript as a whole.

The videos are generally well-presented. I learned a lot.It's probably worth stressing: this is a *programming foundations* course, not a web development foundations course. So it's natural that the stress may be on the javascript aspect.  However, even with that in mind, I thought the instruction was very unstructured. I get that the philosophy was 'let's get students actually doing something', but I think more time needs to be spent covering the basics, especially CSS and Javascript. The coverage of CSS in particular was quite limited.I can also understand the desire to 'make things easier' by having students work with Duke libraries and work in the Duke platform, but I think this is a serious drawback, and ultimately limits what the student can do outside the platform.Students learn how to manipulate an image, but aren't taught enough general knowledge to apply that knowledge in other ways. I'd like to see more shorter exercises that build up 'muscle memory'. You will learn a lot, but expect to spend a fair amount of time going back over videos numerous times and doing other reading on your own.I think the course would be better served by having more exercises that are shorter: build a web page, learn how to do some basic layout and designs, then incorporate JS.

36391216~COURSE!~c_rkuRoBEeWDtQoum3sFeQ,1589480323885,3,0,"There are some very good concepts and attempts at teaching here but there is a lot for frustration too. I have some experience working on GUI programming not quite the same but I understand that sometimes things just don't work the way you want... in this case though lots of concepts aren't explained or aren't linked together. We are given very specific examples without enough reference. When learning new things you build on the old, you can't just say in the last lesson we learned concept x so here is concept y. Now go figure concept z using concept x and y without any knowledge of z. It would be nice to take a few extra minutes to build from the base up so you know x+y=z. We never got that. The lectures are fairly informative and you do get the chance to learn a lot of new concepts but you aren't given enough to really implement your learning and by the time you figure it out you're usually so frustrated that you don't want to continue. The first week was awesome and I really enjoyed it. My webpage turned out well and it was easy to use but once JavaScript was added in the learning became disjointed. I'm disappointed that I didn't get to see that before I paid for the course because if week 2 was the first week I would not have taken this course. The worst thing though is that I found that the ""Try It"" options came before we learned the concept! So I would grit and struggle and fail for hours (the time estimates are so far off for this course) and then finally decide to just move on, only to learn the key concept I was missing wasn't taught until the next lesson! That is so unbelievably frustrating as a learner. On top of that, some things just didn't work in the Duke Learn to Code Program for no reason causing me to have to export my code and refresh the page then reenter my code. So I would spend so much time thinking I did something wrong when I didn't. Then when I was working in CodePen on a problem I actually did everything correctly but the files from the Duke website wouldn't come over wasting time trying to fix my code I went to the forums to find that there is a coding error on Duke's side that prevents the image library from working properly. They provided a solution but that solution does not work! I wasn't able to test something I worked on for hours and I was so frustrated. Why wasn't that issue added to the ""Try It"" instructions? Then I wouldn't have wasted my time. The forums are fairly helpful because the mentors reply and are very good for the most part with their explanations; but not one of my classmates replied which is interesting to me because I saw one post where over 20 people reviewed my code and didn't know why it wasn't working. Most of the posts I saw also showed the frustration I felt with some of these concepts.So, I think if you have some experience with JavaScript and watch the videos in order without stopping each week then go back and do the ""Try It"" options you will be more successful with this course. I certainly don't recommend for a person without any experience and I would reorder/restructure everything in this course to be better for the learner.  ",0,1,Victoria Simonds,36391216

There were many parts that could have been scaffolded by the teachers more with smaller practices. I felt like, even though I understood the material and got good scores on the quizes, I was often asked to create functions that I wasn't yet familiar with. In my opinion, I should be asked to practice and perform what has been discussed in the course and any further help or resources should not only be directed, but also explained. This course assumes that the student has a lot of prior knowledge and understanding of basic programming terms, syntax, and math. For what it's worth, I don't consider the quizes as exercises because they are graded.

I found this course quite exciting, often challenging, but in a good way.  For some reason, ""peer review grade"" is stated in the course info, but there is no such thing. You might post a link to your webpage for your classmates to review, but it's optional and doesn't affect your grades. To complete the course, you'll need to do your coding and answer quiz questions based on that. Basically, nobody ever sees your code, because posting whole programs in the forums is forbidden, and the only grades you get come from quizzes. You can post a piece of code if you're stuck though. I can't fully approve this approach, but in general the course is fine.In my opinion, this course might be a great opportunity to decide whether you enjoy spending time coding or not. If not - you might still have some fun.",0,1,Ekaterina Voronova,4246900

My short-term goal was to grasp the basics of front end programming because I'm working as a business developer for a software house so I can communicate more effectively with my fellow developers, and a medium-term intent to create my own website from scratch. The lecture pace was perfectly tailored for my routine, half an hour a day from Monday to Friday before sleeping and an hour and a half during the weekend. Professors are well-skilled and they've presented content in a clear and easily understood manner, even though some of them are not that comfortable with the camera and lack some ""acting"" skills, but you don't expect that all computer engineers are Steve Jobs of public speaking.    Programming tools, learning materials, and course UI are more practical than attractive but everything is just a click away and I've never felt that something was redundant or unclear, so good job Blue Devils, thank you for making easier my first step into the world where everything is a number (even colors) and building blocks of functional and responsive websites are variables, methods, functions, algorithms, attributes, classes, divisions, canvases, event handlers, pixel coordinates, etc.Oh, yes, one of my biggest takeaways, and something I'll definitely use when explaining the importance and the price behind the analysis and design aspects of our services: work the MF'ing example by hand so you know what you need to do once you start writing code, then start asap with debugging until everything is just as you want it to be ;) Cheers,SO",0,3,Slobodan Ocokoljic,43865299

The videos are short, so you don't get bored watching them, and the script is written for each video, so you can read through the lesson, which helped me process the more difficult concepts. I learned most from doing the projects/ exercises. By giving problems for the student to write code for, it makes the learner actually apply the information from each video. (I don' t get those online learning courses that just show video and after video, with no problems given. This is NOT one of those.) I also enjoy the short quizzes, which solidify understanding of concepts. (You can take quizzes again if you fail!)

the first and the second courses are very easy . but the three remaining courses are a little bit tough 

so you will need to struggle and persist to complete the whole specialization especially the great project .

indeed the project is extremely great . you will use all the concept you have learned through this specialization to implement this great project .... but NOTE this specialization in general and the project  in particular is NOT for a BEGINNER Programmer.  it is for some one who has a background in programming . but overall you will learn a lot of great stuff and concepts .. so have fun and enjoy programming .

On completion of this course, I am able to write a webpage with active URL links, pictures, make ordered, un-ordered lists and make tables with embedded lists and images etc.  In addition I learned how to style the web page with fonts, colors and positions using CSS.           The next section was about image processing using java scripting.  We did steganography , hiding images and text within images. The whole thing was finished with creating an e-Portfolio, which tested everything we learned.
           I enjoyed the course and  am now moving onto the next course in this specialization.
