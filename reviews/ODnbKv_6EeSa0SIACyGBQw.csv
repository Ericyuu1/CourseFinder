71613304~COURSE!~ODnbKv_6EeSa0SIACyGBQw,1601499167516,2,0,"The course is the equivalent
of a first year survey course.  However,  I have two
honours degrees from Canadian universities and a community college diploma and
have taught for many years.  In all of my educational experience I have
rarely come across a professor who is as difficult to listen to or attend to
than Professor Roth.  He has the mannerisms of a nervous man who is
thinking well ahead of what he is saying and is making up his points as he
goes. He stammers perpetually and many of his sentences contain numerous
repetitions and often end without completing a thought.  I
tried to read the transcripts of the videos instead to spare myself the
aggravation of listening to him, but the transcripts are a hopeless shamble of
typos, misspellings, and nonsense.  Here is an example of what I
mean.   ""Morality is an expression of power. And in the
first essay of the Genealogy of Morals, which is an account of, of, of
morality, you've only been assigned the second essay. In the first essay, he
says, it, it, he does say that morality is an expression power but is really perverse
in the west.""  Here is another example:  “You,
because society's the ultimate creditor. And a strong society is a society that
can say, you know, forget about it. You know? You, you, you did something
really bad, you're at Wesleyan, you get 2 points. [laugh] 4 points now, right?
You just[UNKNOWN] points.” In
short the course is moderately informative and interesting but destroyed by the
presentation.  ",0,0,Rayser Ray,71613304

For one thing, it is like ""the blind leading the  blind"". In order to access another person's essay, you have to know more about the topic than was is featured in the lectures. This being the case, you have  to specify where and how the student is going off the track. Peers can't do  that. For example, several times I thought a student was wrong  about some comment, but, I was not sure. Perhaps they knew more about the  topic that I did, thus, rendering my impression mistaken. But I wasn't sure. So, I gave them the benefit of doubt. But, if I  was right and they were wrong, then they kept their misapprehension. Not exactly, good education.And, then sometimes, I, myself, was unsure of a point in my essay. The chances of a  peer correcting  it was  pretty nil. Lots of peers do not have the time for lengthy commentary (their comments tend to be too brief to be of much help) and they often don't feel qualified  to make negative (but tactful) corrections. One last thing: sometimes students don't really write anything. They just input random letters or numbers. One student inputted the  assignment directions instead of composing an essay. In these cases, I gave them a 0. I felt bad about that, but aren't these examples of cheating?On a positive note; I thoroughly enjoyed the readings and the lectures. I  also liked the fact that I can access a transcript (although a garbled one) and I LOVE the variable speed dial on the lectures. But, most of all, I LOVE that I can audit these courses and am very grateful to all of you who have made this possible. You have made my retirement more enjoyable.
