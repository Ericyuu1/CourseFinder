118193938~COURSE!~Qf73BjGjEeqIPQqRfoc3XQ,1667936967954,1,0,"Too many people here that really have no idea what they are talking about when it comes to peer reviews. Not everyone falls into this category of course. There are some great story tellers in this course. The reviews are based on a criterion required to complete an assignment. However, there are so many terrible writers on here that when it comes to reviews, they only implement negativity towards your story. Then they try to change it, break you down, and leave you without the ability to respond back to them. I read the required writing assignments from these people and was appalled to discover how terrible all of their writing and storytelling came to be. My suggestion is to just believe in yourself, take a creative writing course, grammar, and editing to help develop your writing skills. Engage in an active community with other writers such as poetry readings for example or join library clubs in your local areas. There are too many people here that are not great and will tear you down just for a grade because that is the only way they can contribute to the community from this platform. On a positive note, the instructor here is quite passionate, and you can learn a lot from him. There is just zero control for the toxic element that comes from this course. To all the great writers out there discovering this path, flee the wretched winds of toxicity. To all the others, do not quit your day jobs.",0,1,Jason Yarbrough,118193938

As a student, you have to do your own research to learn about the topics he briefly mentions. I was okay with that, but I should have looked ahead because after you write Chapter 1, you get short videos that tell you to 'Write Chapter X' and that continues until you get to the end, where you get more short videos that tell you nothing. I only know because I looked ahead and decided not to waste my time here. I'm taking my first chapter and moving to another site where I can actually learn about writing a book. The other thing is that the feedback is really hit and miss. You might have a couple of serious students, but most of them are people who can't even form a complete sentence correctly and are judging your work, all because it's required to continue. That being the case, it's difficult to get good feedback. Mostly though, it's just the lack of instruction. As an adult, I don't need a 15-second video telling me to write the next chapter.

It's much easier to connect to other writer on those fourms than in this class) Got very litttle helpful feedback from peers (you get tired of seeing ""Good job!"" or ""Interesting"" over and over again. Those aren't critiques) The videos are so vauge about story structure to cover every type that they aren't helpful. There are books, podcasts, and videos on other platforms that cover much more (I'd actually suggest things that rip into what doesn't work. Learning what doesn't work can help to better stucture things in a way that actually does)O​ther issues that drag the class down is there's no way to follow a story from a fellow peer unless they're in a created group OUTSIDE THE CLASS, which negates the need for it in the first place. It doesn't help that I have sites I've used before this class to get feedback. There also isn't any staff intereaction at all. Anything goes wrong there's no help. This already gives off abandoned vibes.A​lso, you don't actually have to finish a novel to finish the course; just jump to the last section and answer an open-ended response question on the course itself (I'm sure it doesn't actually check anything, going by the rest of the course's content) and it's fully complete.

6913837~COURSE!~Qf73BjGjEeqIPQqRfoc3XQ,1617730437553,1,0,"This course is a fantastic idea. I have studied half a dozen creative writing courses, such as by Iowa Uni, but this takes the urge to write to the next logical step. Given the availability of self publishing it has the potential to take amateur enthusiasts forward to taking that step. BUT, a course with no content has no value. The premise of this course is that the mentor just needs to encourage, and the resulting motivation,  discipline of daily writing, and feedback from peers will do the rest. This is huge contrast to the teaching, assignments, literature references and community discussions on courses such as that on compiler writing. It is not explained by any difference between creative and technological courses. Worse, it fails as an approach as the peer review is beyond poor, unstructured and often not timely. The approach taken by the course is just as haphazard as, say, uploading text to WattPad and hoping for the best.  The practical problems with the course are: a) APPALLINGLY BAD, VERY THIN ON THE GROUND, UNSTRUCTURED FEEDBACK, EG, ""Seems good, nothing to add"" b) No way to correspond directly with those providing feedback  c) no way to edit or correct chapter submissions d) no way to correct formatting errors when you cut and paste text for submissions e) No way to control the selection of work you get to review or follow chapter by chapter those you have reviewed earlier (other than pop luck) f) No help setting up groups or support for those in groups that fail f) No practical guidance other than have a beginning middle and end and stick to 500 words a day g) The discussion fora are mostly about frustration and confusion. Where is the tutor intervention and feedback? I joined a Slack group in Week 1. It was closed down by its administrator before Week 2 as she told me that one or more of the others in the group had no work ethic, could not take positive criticism and were rude and insulting. I doubt this was an isolated incident. I have completed 30+ reviews in the first few weeks, and excepting non sensical or blank submissions, I have tried to write several paragraphs in feedback covering impressions, my personal response and ideas relevant to a better experience for the generic reader. I get a trickle of reviews on my own work, only two out of, say, ten have offered anything useful. Most are one or two sentences. Overall, to date I am hugely disappointed by this wasted opportunity.

The author of the course, David Wheeler is an exceptional teacher. Through small steps he leads you onto ever larger themes. his method of keeping you going has been absolutely invaluable to me. I was not able to visualise how i would write twenty chapters. But by staying the course and doing what was required I have managed it. Am I satisfied? and proud? you bet! The format of editing 5 other writers before you continue with your next chapter has also proven invaluable. Truly, this process enabled me to continue even when it was difficult to do so (to keep going). Many of the writers i started with have slowed down quite dramatically. This is partly because life interferes and it must for most of us, but also because keeping up with the programme was sometimes hard. not because it was hard but because we all struggle sometimes.

However, on the other side, the process to stick to 500 words per day 5 days a week, submitting each week a chapter, and doing the group reading each act turned out a good process I was able to stick to.

Now I ended up with one first volume of three in a total.Thank you for having me brought up to this level.PS: the technical process that one cannot edit a chapter is cumbersome, that Coursera repeatedly shut down the saving process.... this is very hard to take.
