11735856~COURSE!~zDub1RTVEeueYA64LqU_IQ,1661195702436,3,0,"I​ thought that the beginning of the course was good as it explained the history of Korean philosophy. However, I could not understand the emphases on maeum, heart/mind, as a part of what makes Korean philosophy different from western philosophy. I think that we in the west also believe that the heart and mind are strongly connected and that all decisions are a combination of facts and feelings.  This can be heard, for example, in the expressions: ""I have a bad feeling about this,"" or ""I have a good feeling about this,"" after a decision has been made.O​ur medical and psychological disciplines and studies frequently talk about the mind/body connection in the most positive terms. A patient's thinking is usually considered instrumental in their prognosis after a diagnosis. W​ith the concept of uri 우리 explanation, I don't think it was described in a way that makes it clear what the difference is between the western use of the collective 'we' and the pronoun that includes only the speaker and a listener.  Growing up in northern England, I frequently heard people refer to ""our dad,"" ""our sister,"" and so on in many conversations. I don't think the difference between the Korean use of 우리 and other western examples was clear.O​ne thing that was clear, though, was the idea that context is important and that Korean minds organize information in specific ways not familiar with people in other cultures. I​ enjoyed the course, but felt it was extremely basic. I would like to see something a little more specific. For example, the Korean response to suffering, nationalism, and religious beliefs.T​hank you for the course.M​adeleine J. Whitfield",0,1,madeleine jane whitfield,11735856
