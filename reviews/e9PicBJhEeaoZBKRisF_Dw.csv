56963233~COURSE!~e9PicBJhEeaoZBKRisF_Dw,1610635751998,2,0,"I believe that this was an extremely informative course, but the presenter could have spoken less than he did. I felt he was too verbose.Mr. Stearns would be very helpful in a classroom; he speaks at length about these concepts, and he would definitely benefit from the in-person aspect of these lessons. However, his lessons often would include him talking at length about these concepts, but never really *saying* anything. I would find myself reading the transcript rather than the video, because there was no visual stimulation or practical examples for these lessons. If anything, I believe a course like this would much benefit from more real-world examples. Maybe having more examples in a DAW, or plugging in a guitar and showing how each effect changes the instrument's tone rather than just showing a pre-recorded song and saying ""This thing does this thing"". Despite all of the negativity I wrote on this review, however, this course really did help me pursue my passion for music. I did learn a lot about audio design, but it took me longer than I expected I did. If I ever came off as rude during this review, please forgive me.

17927300~COURSE!~e9PicBJhEeaoZBKRisF_Dw,1490715136949,2,0,"I've just completed the course subject to peer review grading.  I must say that this was the WORST online course I've ever taken and I've taken a lot of online courses (including YouTube tutorials by people who were clearly intoxicated when creating their masterpieces).  To begin, the recommended software options for screen movies and presentation are awful choices - not to mention ""Prezi"" is subscription service.  I didn't use it.  Try Open Office which has a ""PowerPoint"" type presentation software if you are looking to save costs.  There's also an enormous technical problem with the screen movie makers suggested (at least with the PC versions).  You cannot record from your microphone and capture internal sound card information (i.e. sounds produced by your DAW) simultaneously with any of the ""suggested"" programs I tried.  The solution was a virtual sound card (I used Voice Meeter) where I could route the sounds accordingly so you could hear the sound produced by my DAW while I spoke.  Considering this is a technology course, you would think this would be addressed. It is not.There is almost no practical discussion.  There's plenty of ""what,"" --- an overwhelming amount of what actually --- but not much ""how"" or ""why.""Others may experience this course differently depending on your goals.  If you record vocals and real instruments and want to learn how to do this so everything sounds fantastic, this isn't the course for you.  There's a tiny bit of that discussed with microphone placement and the like, but it quickly moves to digital sound creation.  If you want to use synths and effects and noise things and such to create EDM music ... well, this isn't the course for you either, but maybe it would be more beneficial to you than most other categories.  So, who is this course for?  I can't say I'm sure of the answer to that.  If you are wanting to be a sound designer, perhaps you would learn the vocabulary for sound design but not much ""how.""  If you use Logix as your DAW, perhaps you will learn where something is you hadn't seen before (although the videos are hard to follow as some things are happening off screen or aren't the focus of the video). In the end, this course was very much a ""self teaching"" course.  I didn't learn much from the video lectures provided by Berklee other than application of a few terms in music I'd never considered much with a background in playing instruments rather than playing a digital synth, like ""ADSR.""  I spent more time on other websites and YouTube videos and in my DAW's operation manual as we were often told, ""Go to your DAW and figure out how to use an XYZ."" Rarely did it include ""how and why"" to use that XYZ for musicality. The quizzes were awful as well. There's a lot of ""minutia"" detail in the lectures that never seems to have any relevance because there's no practical application discussed.  Make sure you know this not very relevant information because it will be on the quiz --- like how to determine the word length and bit depth using some formula involving 2 to the power of something.... it still doesn't make since because I don't know why or how it applies.  Also, note that not everything is completely uniform in DAWs with some terms being different in each one.  This was extremely confusing because I don't use Logix and the lessons do.  I had a terrible time figuring out many things simply because my DAW had another term or button name for it.I'm glad this is over. I feel like I learned a little bit, but don't feel like it's information I'll retain for long since I have no idea how to use much of the information for my purposes.  Maybe on a game of Jeopardy?Sorry for the length of this, but I hope you find the information helpful in deciding whether you will benefit from this class.",0,26,Jay Morris,17927300
