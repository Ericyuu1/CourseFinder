46575435~COURSE!~gbfALuBMEemE_go1N_G8Fg,1652701610414,1,0,"The content of the instructions  seems unstructued. The introduction of every lessons lasts only a few minuts. The coding tutorials offered by the GTAs are neither insightful nor explanatory, where the learners are simply required to type along. Theere are also consistency issues the way the code, so that many manners can be confusing for beginners. The assignments are not designed with the resources in mind in that, some of them require an increadibly long time to train, unless it's migrated into colab, where other issues like loading pretrained models and datasets need to be taken care of. Also, the instructions are at times vague, and the problems can only be seen once graded. No or not enough efforts were made for step by step checks and guides to help the student.Personally, I would recommend the deep learning specialization from deeplearning.ai, which is organized way better.",0,0,Shaokai Zheng,46575435

A little stretch from the taught material is training and exercising, too much stretch is kind of waste of time. I took 4 weeks part timely to complete the Capstone project, which supposed to take an hour. And in general, I know my progress in other courses.

13303984~COURSE!~gbfALuBMEemE_go1N_G8Fg,1626432623144,4,0,"Overall, an exceptional and highly relevant course.  I would have given it five stars, however some instructions on the capstone project were too vague, causing the project to take much more time to complete than is really necessary.  Also, it appears that correctly completed neural network translators don't appear to produce very good translations, at least in the form we were asked to design, and I think there should be some comment about that from the instructor.  Is it because the embeddings we were given were not that great?  Was it because the network we designed was not deep enough to be effective, or was our custom training loop not well conceived?  Thank you for developing and presenting this course.  I especially appreciated Dr. Webster's clear and concise lecture videos.  Overall, I thought the course nicely dovetailed with the two Andrew Ng courses I previously completed on Machine Learning and Deep Learning (with TensorFlow 1).  This course helped me become a better programmer and was worth the effort I had to invest in it.  Hopefully I will complete the final course in the specialization very soon, and launch my new career in AI software engineering!",0,2,Andrew H Nichols,13303984

The assignments followed on logically from the weekly exercises and tutorials and the capstone project for RNN encoder-decoder required additional problem solving (I recommend reading this additional resource https://machinelearningmastery.com/return-sequences-and-return-states-for-lstms-in-keras/).Kevin Webster and the programming tutorials teachers were clear and brilliant as usual.
