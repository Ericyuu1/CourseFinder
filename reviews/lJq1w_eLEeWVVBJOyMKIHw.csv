111550027~COURSE!~lJq1w_eLEeWVVBJOyMKIHw,1671920631708,1,0,The Final Projects are ok in giving an insight but there are 2 huge issues with this course.1. Some of the software/websites are out of date or have updated versions so the given manual in the course doesnÂ´t really work anymore. This is a problem but not such a huge one. The second problem is really bad though.2. Every single final project (3 of them) are all based on peer-reviews. Peer-reviews take a loooong time. Especially if you need 5-6!! of them. I have been waiting for 1 Months now to get my reviews and have been reviewing so many submissions from others. I have seen some submissions from 2 years ago!! This is a real problem,0,2,Jaehyun Lee,111550027

85584473~COURSE!~lJq1w_eLEeWVVBJOyMKIHw,1647187449424,1,0,"What a sad anticlimax to an otherwise really good specialisation!!!Important data for this course, as well as vital links, no longer exist. The organisers have been made aware of this 2 years ago and no-one appears to have done anything. Unless the data is re-shared, it is probably best to make this course obsolete. If you persevere like I did, and you use your own head and show some initiative, it is possible to complete 2 out of 3 assignments of this course , however don't expect your answers to match the ""stock"" answers. This makes grading yourself and other people farsical.",0,13,Markella Mikkelsen,85584473
