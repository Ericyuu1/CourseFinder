That said, this is  a more or less technical course in Remote Sensing and may not pass for an introductory course to the subject at all. It also requires certain level of mathematical background to be able to grasp a number of concepts. The only reason I could follow is that I have been in the field for a while, and even then, I had to review the course materials multiple times before attempting the quizzes.

It helps if you already have a background in CS or maths (preferably a degree in one of those two fields). Starting in the second third of the course, the lectures fluctuate between very easy going to profound mathematics. Don't be fooled by the week time needed estimations - following this estimations you will get just a basic understanding, which will be enough to complete the quizzes, but for a better understanding of lecture material, be prepared to invest 2x the estimated time.",0,3,Anze Medved,9560612

The course was well structured and the professor excellently. explained most of the machine learning algorithms in the context of remote sensing applications. I am quite disappointed to  see the reviews of my fellow learners rate the course -low. I would like to stress it to the future learners thinking of taking this course to confidently enroll without a doubt. I agree that the concepts are quite hard to understand and may need an active learning mindset.However this course is the ONLY course which has tried to intuitively explain the application of machine learning to remote sensing datasets. Furthermore, the professor (John richards)is a legend in the field and we need to appreciate his passion for the subject and his effort to disseminate knowledge to students!Cheers!!",0,0,phanisai,28480268
