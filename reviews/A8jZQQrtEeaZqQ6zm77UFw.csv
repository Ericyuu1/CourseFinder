The professor repeats what you've already read in his book; there are some clips in the videos but they have terrible quality. It is really disappointing, I had great expectations.",0,1,Carmen Fallas,63518745
44062907~COURSE!~A8jZQQrtEeaZqQ6zm77UFw,1592730265794,2,0,"the course in itself has good content and I enjoyed. However, I must say that it comes with a book by Prof Green that basically says exactly the same things as the course. You can find the book online in a PDF version, and at least you won't have to buy it additionally to this class. The content is interesting in some chapters, but this course is terrible in the way it is graded. It is only peer-graded, so don't expect any valuable feedback. And expect some frustration because you have to wait the other people grade your assignment in oder to complete the course. With a little bit more effort in the grading department, it could be a great course. As it is now, I would maybe recommend to simply read the book of Prof Green (The opportunity analysis canvas), you won't miss out on too much and be less frustrated by the peer-graded system. Unless you need the certificate for your CV..",0,1,Letizia Bordoli,44062907
