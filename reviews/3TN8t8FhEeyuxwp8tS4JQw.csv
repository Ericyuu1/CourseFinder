24582944~COURSE!~3TN8t8FhEeyuxwp8tS4JQw,1676143776715,4,0,"Dr. Carls German English took some effort and a few rewinds to understand :D Naturally some transcription was wrong as a result. Clarity could be better if  less exclamations & comments were used in-between concepts & sentences.Most readings took longer time than specified, though I enjoyed diving deep with understanding.External exercises had some misplaced or missing text, slightly superfluous English (ie...not concise), thus difficult to understand from first read. Took more time than allocated. Overall course took more time than shown in study plan. Also some typos in quizzes. Ex. On one quiz, the question asked to select the ""false statement from below"", while the correct answer was about selecting the ""true statement"" instead.Content introduced useful concepts, I could not find a course that provided similar content. Much gratitude and Thanks to Dr. Carl and all who contributed to educating us from the convenience of our busy lives. Thank you.",0,0,Adnan Safi,24582944
