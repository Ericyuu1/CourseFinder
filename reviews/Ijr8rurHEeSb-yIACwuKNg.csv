42005625~COURSE!~Ijr8rurHEeSb-yIACwuKNg,1563503820932,1,0,"This is an extremely flawed course, both technically and academically. Half of the math used in the first week is incorrect (anyone using a calculator would discover this, but I also worked as an accountant for many years, as well as previously working in the financial markets as an investment analyst, so my math skills are above-average), and even when they made one correction in the video, they missed the other 20 or so. Even the textbook written by the professor has math errors in it (such as 12 X 0.99 supposedly being equal o 11.98 - not on this plant, or any other I know of, since it's actually 11.88). There are mix-ups in what shows up in what areas of the quizzes (such as Rutherford's gold foil experiment being in the first test, but the first week covers an entirely different area), and the first quiz talks about stuff that isn't discussed at all. Please explain how anyone would know grams per litre of SF6 at sea level when it isn't covered anywhere in the textbook or the lectures or the test itself. Not once did he explain the terms diatomic vs. monatomic (only the brief blip with Avogadro and how 'some molecules must be made up of two atoms then' as a conclusion, but no way to determine which ones, and not the actual meaning of the terms that ended up on a test). Nor does he talk about what (aq) is supposed to mean, where he uses it in brackets in an actual chemical formula. From my understanding of math, I'm supposed to be able to multiple aq by the rest of the formula, but since there is no element called aq, I have to guess that can't be right and it must mean aqueous solution, rather than a solid, but again that isn't even mentioned. Less than 2 seconds of time to explain, but the students are expected to search all over the internet for the answers. Um, isn't that the entire point of taking a class? So that that someone *teaches* the subject instead of students being forced to go to Wikipedia (which is generally frowned upon by academia)?

Although these are never conceptual mistakes and, while attentively following the lectures, one can quickly pinpoint them as mere speech or transcription mistakes as the lecturer delivers his ideas, this fact can get confusing for a less experienced or slightly distracted student.

37182807~COURSE!~Ijr8rurHEeSb-yIACwuKNg,1584195699042,4,0,"I took the course ""General Chemistry:  Concept Development and Application"" from Dec 2019 - Mar 2020.  I found this to be an excellent course on many levels.  First, I thought the educational theory of the course was outstanding.  Beginning each unit with empirical data, building from these to create a model (inductive reasoning), and then applying/adapting the model to answer questions/solve problems (deductive reasoning), was fantastic.  I took general chemistry for the first time 40 years ago, and was taught using a strictly deductive reasoning approach - and honestly I really didn't like chemistry all that much.  It seemed stale and boring.  To my great surprise however I found that when I became a practicing chemist in industry, I totally loved chemistry!  This love has deepened and broadened throughout my career.  I applaud Prof.  Hutchinson on creating this course and making it available on Coursera.Second, I think the course structure was outstanding.  It seems to me that the entire course aim was to get the student to understand that at equilibrium, delta G^0 = -RTlnKp.  Each unit in the course introduced data and theories which led to this powerful relationship between thermodynamics and equilibrium.  I relearned concepts and equations from my past and came to understand and appreciate them in new ways.I could not give the course 5 stars however due to the many errors I found throughout.  There were errors in what was said in the lectures, errors in what was hand written in the lectures, and most importantly errors in quiz questions and answers.  Some of the quiz questions had no correct answer option at all.  Other quiz questions/answers were very poorly worded.  Fortunately I had a chemistry career to fall back up when confronted with these errors.  However I have concern for those taking this course as their very first introduction to chemistry.  It could be very frustrating and confusing to these individuals.  A thorough review and correction of the course lectures and quizzes would be most beneficial.Despite these limitations - I heartily recommend this course to any wishing to get an introduction to fundamental chemistry concepts and principles.  It allows the student the understand where our current understanding of chemistry came from and how this is applied in current chemical research.",0,1,David Damon,37182807

I would have benefited a from more time invested in the quizzes. They were not well edited. (Similarly, the e-book could use a good edit.) This was an annoyance more than a severe detraction, however it leads into a larger issue. I believe that the motivated e-student benefits from a more involved means of analyzing content-retention / gestation than simple multiple choice questions. In fact, one might argue that the whole idea of a MOOC is the quizzes / tests of comprehension. If you wanted to learn it on your own, you could just buy a book and go to the Kahn Academy for some videos. (This gets into a larger subject that edX, coursera and the whole MOOC experiment needs to ask with earnestness -- whether the traditional class-delivery model is sufficient in an online forum. I would argue strongly that a greater investment is needed -- that Kahn Academy is a different breed. This raises an obvious financial question -- for non-tenured editors, quiz makers, etc. But asking the money question too soon is putting the cart before the horse.)

The approach when I took it during class was very rote-memorization-heavy and I was worse off for it.  Prof. Hutchinson lays things out in a very logical way and all the learning is based on key questions that a curious learner would likely find themselves asking; all the ""why"" questions you might have while learning Gen Chem are answered and not brushed off with a ""just memorize it.""  It does probably help some that I was exposed to this material once already but I am retaining so much more than when I took this course in college or even than when I was going through the ExamKrackers MCAT Chemistry book.

The course is planned well and delivered in a most professional way. It's apparent that a lot of work went into creating this course. The use of the split screen is a good technique that fully engages the learner, and following the concept development concept throughout the lectures provides a solid foundation for moving from one concept to another. The minor negatives are the pdf file of the CDS material didn't always present correctly (especially tables, a common problem converting Word to pdf) and some of the chapter numbers didn't match ... but these are minor glitches and did not detract from the course itself.I can't say enough good things about this course. I kept thinking how great it would be to attend Rice University and attend Professor Hutchinson's classes.  It's quite evident that he loves teaching and it shows in his lectures.
