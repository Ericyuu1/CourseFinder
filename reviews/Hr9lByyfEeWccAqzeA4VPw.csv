Quality of videos, material and interviews is horrible.

4174178~COURSE!~Hr9lByyfEeWccAqzeA4VPw,1452949449577,2,0,"This course has great potential as it is an extraordinarily timely topic, domestically and globally. The accessible required reading assignments were thought provoking and topical.  Also, one of the required videos proved helpful, and a couple of the optional Ted talks were ""must see's"" for anyone involved in the non-profit sector.It was problematic that there was so little direction with respect to how one might access the required reading materials that were not linked into the course syllabus.  In fact, one of the links provided simply directed the learners to a youtube video, extolling the virtues of the book wherein the required chapter was located.  Another blatant colleague marketing technique occurred during the course of one of the required videos wherein the organizer interviewed an author about his book.  (There was some helpful substantive information that came out of that interview, but for the most part, I felt as though I was watching an infomercial.)  Requests for help fell on deaf ears, except for those of co-learners.A small, but annoying, flaw was that the professors were simply reading text from their slides, for the video component of the course--with an additional word thrown in, on occasion, for good measure.  It would have been less distracting just to have the slides to read.I wish this course had been designed and taught to the standards I have come to expect from Coursera courses.  It could have been one of the most valuable yet. ",0,8,Amy Clark,4174178
57589842~COURSE!~Hr9lByyfEeWccAqzeA4VPw,1611335975300,3,0,"There were signification technical issues (such as dead or inactive links some of which were required reading/reference) with this course as well as the exceptionally dated submissions and contributions within the Forums.  It would seem that there were few active participants in the course - which could very useful to know when beginning it (including geographics as to where the participants were from - ideally in a dashboard for a quick review... and the opportunity to easily connect with select peers... other than trying to navigate through numerous forums - where again the initiated threads by Moderators dated back over 4 years in some cases).  Additionally, some of the readings and references were also dated.  Finally, having Faculty engage with participants rather than simply reading powerpoints would be much more more beneficial (the slides would be part of require readings and reference in advance of the video with Faculty who could then speak to it at an overall level or expand of them).  Overall, however, the content was very well laid out and did a good job addressing the topic of the course.",0,0,Allen LeBlanc,57589842

I also believe that the assignments of week 4 and 5 should be divided differently so that the BEAR is due in week 5, and only the general assessment of organisations in your area is due in week 4.

5778009~COURSE!~Hr9lByyfEeWccAqzeA4VPw,1452373996110,4,0,"My overall experience with this Specialization, in general, and this 1st Course, in particular, is very positive.On the positive side, I really like the fact that the Courses are practice-oriented and provide not only theoretical frameworks, but also insights from experts, practical guidance, and evidence-based best practices.Also, the idea of applying Team-Based Learning (TBL), in the forms of Readiness Assurance Tests (RATs) and scenario-based RAT Application Exercises, for assessing participants' learning, is excellent!However, there are a couple of downsides, that's why I'm not giving a 5 star positive feedback.The first problem is that not all of the required readings are freely available via the Coursera platform, or elsewhere online. I appreciate the excellent quality of the chosen materials, but, if it becomes compulsory to spend more than US $100 for buying books, then the total cost of this Specialization elevates quite a lot, given that I had to pay €162 for it. On my opinion, there should be at least a note in the description of both the Specialization and the Courses about these requirements, in order to make an informed decision before enrolling.The second downside has to do with Course 1 and Course 2 overlapping materials. I'm referring to guest interview videos. That's mainly a problem of the 2nd Course, as there are almost no guest interviews in this Course, and the one interview provided is already available in Course 1. I understand that the topics discussed apply to the topics of both Courses, but, still, I find it an unnecessary repetition.The last problem is about the dates that the Courses are run. Course 1 runs during a given period, Course 2 is on demand, but it makes sense to attend it before Course 3, that also runs during a given period, which overlaps with the period of the 1st Course. Sorry, this makes it very difficult to attend everything and to seriously focus, as it's always about running for deadlines, especially when one has to produce three (3) Board Effectiveness Assessment Reflection (BEAR) papers :( .",0,6,Michail Drakomathioulakis,5778009
