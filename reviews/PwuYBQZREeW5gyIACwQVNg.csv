This course contains an overview of manipulation in complex
numbers at a second-year undergraduate level. Various techniques, such as
visualizing mappings, solving integrals, and manipulating series in complex
numbers are introduced. The course also goes through some of the application of
a few crucial theorems, such as Cauchy-Riemann Equations, Cauchy’s Theorem and
Cauchy Integral Formula.
8 weeks ago, I started this course with a knowledge of some
very basic real analysis (the epsilon-delta definition of convergence,
differentiation, and Riemann integration). As a major in mathematics, I found
this course refreshing and a pleasure to take. Dr Taylor’s voice was engaging,
and the lecture notes were self-contained and well-explained. 
One remarkable feature that I want to highlight is the coursework
component. It consisted of graded quizzes with multiple choices, tick boxes,
and some short fill in the blanks. There were also graded peer assignments once
per 2 weeks, this made sure that our answers produced are readable by other
people. I found the difficulty of the coursework very appropriate: it was
deliberately not straightforward, and you must be careful while applying
different theorems and concepts that were taught in the lessons. The
peer-graded assignment also emphasized communicating mathematics carefully,
with clearly given guidance and appropriate suggestions from other learners, it
was a very well thought out part of the course. 
The course was very enjoyable on its own. But certain
features could be more well-polished. Overall, this feels like a course for
applied mathematicians. Heavy focus is put on and applying the results.
However, with a little bit of generalization and more discussions of proofs and
their logic behind them, it can benefit more pure mathematicians that are
interested in the subject. Similarly, I think the assignments (especially the
peer-graded ones) can be more proof-centric, with more videos explaining the
sketch of proof in more detail. Therefore, the course can aim for a balance
between applied and pure content, which would in turn benefit more learners.
Moreover, even with the addition of Residue Calculus, I
still think that more content can be added to the course. It currently contains
topics such as Solving Real-valued Integrals, Understanding the Mandelbrot set,
etc. But more applied topics, such as introducing the idea of the harmonic
equation in liquid flow or heat flow using polar coordinate might be more
inspiring and make the course more fulfilling.
Lastly, I found Week 5 (The first week that introduces
complex integration) particularly challenging. I think I spent twice the time
revising it compared to other units in this course. Therefore I think it will
be better to add new content and let the whole course be 12-week long or so.
Overall, I enjoy this course a lot, and I will recommend anyone
who has an interest in Complex numbers and have 1-2 years of experience in
university STEM subjects.

myself for in this course, for example include 1. Nyquist stability criterion, as it relates to classical approach
to analysis and design of the control systems,2. Fourier, Laplace and Z-transforms, with rigorous approach
to definition of the region of convergence, and generalized functions transformations, Nyquist stability criterion actually comes from residue
theorem, so with addition of the week 7, that goal is partially fulfilled. Actually, without week 7, this course would not have much of
the sense at all. To include topics like Julia and Mandelbrot sets, and even Riemann
Hypothesis, while skimping on Cauchy’s Theorem and Integral Formula, and actually
to completely left out Residue Theorem and its applications altogether… well
that would be pure ""l'art pour l'art"". From each sentence, this course instructor knowledge and
expertise clearly shines, but so does the fascinations with pretty, fractal
like, pictures or open problems in mathematics. From that kind of fascinations
the greatest results in mathematics  came.
Complex analysis is one of those gems, so don’t cut corners on it. Most of the proofs are just sketched, or omitted
altogether. That is really unfortunate, because proofs of the complex analysis
theorems are really good way to gain in depth understanding of the subject
meter. Very much like in vector calculus, the approach and ideas in those
proofs, have universal applicability in wide range of engineering areas. To

If you've done complex analysis before, the final exam will be straightforward, if you're learning it, it requires more thought and the high pass grade threshold insists on that.  The assesments require real engagement and this isn't a course that you can approach lightly but as a summary review of the subject, you couldn't ask for more.",0,1,James Cemmell,89211537

79261103~COURSE!~PwuYBQZREeW5gyIACwQVNg,1613926386271,5,0,"The course is not very in-depth, but it
helps to recall the Complex Analysis if you have studied it before. To the
disadvantages of the course, I would attribute the fact that the Laurent series
and singular points of analytic functions are not considered in sufficient
detail. This is a very difficult topic. Series expansions are mainly considered
for rational functions, and other cases are considered very briefly. As a
result, by the final exam, I felt rather unconfident with the Laurent series.
Also, it seems like the author intentionally avoids the use of some
well-established terms, such as holomorphic and meromorphic functions, and I don’t
think it is a good decision. Many concepts are intuitive and seem clear during
the lectures, but are difficult when it comes time to quizzes. For me
personally, the most interesting was the second week devoted to fractals. These
topics are often not covered in the standard course of Complex Analysis, and
almost all this information was new to me. The elements of number theory
(Riemann's hypothesis and Euler's results) also made me happy. The overall
impression of the course is positive, but some hard topics are unjustifiably
superficially presented. It might be better to extend the course for one or two

Much less focus is put on proofs, although some simple proofs are presented and sometimes the instructor outlines the main ideas behind other formal proofs. It may be beneficial to follow a standard textbook on complex analysis along with the online course. Last thing, the course is not easy. Unless you already have substantial experience with complex analysis prepare to study intensively. My experience is that it is important to re-do on your own all material covered during lectures. And indeed, without a good background on calculus and some general mathematical fluency, this course would be hard to complete.",0,2,Marcin Basiuk,28701249

Week 4 lessons 4 and 5 deal with the Riemann Zeta function and the Prime Number Theorem, very interesting and addition to the course. There is much more that could be added, perhaps a further course can be developed for the MOOC. ",0,1,Gary Upshaw,4284842

This is an introductory course on complex  analysis and does not cover advanced topics like zeta function,  Manderbolt set etc in great detail. If you are doing major on  Mathematics and looking for a graduate level course, this is not for  you.This course offers an introduction to complex numbers, then  discusses briefly on function iteration. In this course, you will learn  on complex functions, complex derivative and integration, Cauchy-Riemann  equation, Residues. The topics required to pursue undergraduate science  education are covered nicely in this course.It is essential to do  the quizzes and assignments to get hold of this topic. I thought the  exercises in the course are not enough. I would recommend to do more  exercises from any standard textbook on Complex Analysis. This course  does not specifically follow any textbook. You will get some suggestions  for textbook in the discussion forum.To get a deeper understanding,  it is a great idea to follow the discussion forum. If you have any  difficulty in understanding any topic, you can share in the discussion  forum. Also following other people's questions helps you to develop an  insight on this topic. Discussion forum is an integral part of this  course. Use it wisely.To conclude, any high school graduate can take the course without any difficulty.  ",0,3,Arpon Paul,11395916
