First of all, the theory was well explained in combination with practical examples. Thanks to both of these factors, gaining knowledge and understanding the content was easy. In my opinion, the content itself is very relevant, especially when you have to deal with the international environment every day at work, school, etc.

Secondly, I would like to note the professionalism of the lecturer and how easy it was to follow him, as well as understand his well-spoken English (even better than well). The participants (students) were also interestingly integrated into the lectures, which I think is a great advantage of this course.

The only thing I personally didn't like was the amount of theory. Sometimes it overwhelmed me, especially when out of 5 videos, only 1 was practical.

It is a great experience to listen to Prof. Franz  to discuss management theories and evidence from the latest research on human behavior, it was an honor to listen to Bocconi Alumni who were able to provide personal experiences  from which we were able to glean wisdom,  knowledge, and best practices in looking for solutions on organizational behavior, cultural diversity, employee motivation, leadership communication,  conflict management, and the overall goal of  achieving objectives  amidst globalization challenges. A​s an Asian, it is also nice to note the consideration and validation this course has done to respect cultural  differences, and the recognition that western practices may not work well in other countries. For this message alone, I commend the wisdom of Bocconi, and the great  inputs and presentation of Professor Franz Wohlgezogen.Thank you for the course Bocconi. I for one, will be going back again and again to your lecture and recommended reading materials for a review and  refresher on leadership and management course. I may have finished this course, it has opened up for me the realization that despite my 18 years of  work experience, there is still a huge need for me to learn more, observe more, and improve more on my skills and capacities as a leader for my workplace, my country, and the global community.T​hank you, Bocconi.

liked the experiences shared by Bocconi alumni. I also liked the interactive
style of the various lectures - good mix between presentation, dialogue and
discussion, practical examples. One minor critique – assistant professor could
reduce rapidity of talking and pause a little more. That would make it easer to
follow, digest and reflect.
