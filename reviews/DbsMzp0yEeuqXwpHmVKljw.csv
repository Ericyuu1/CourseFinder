It's very clearly slapped together from a lot of advertising and training material that they already had lying around. It spends an absurd amount of time advertising Quickbooks as software meant to automate a lot of the tedious processes of bookkeeping, but the tests are designed around using extremely poorly formatted prefabbed excel spreadsheets that look like they're purposefully designed to manufacture eye strain. The videos have very little educational content but run on endlessly, somehow managing to say the same thing over and over again without making anything clearer. There are many interactive activities that are genuinely broken, there are many times you will be quizzed but receive no feedback about what you could do better, and there are many errors riddled throughout the course that will make some assignments/tests impossible if you actually try to follow the instructions as intended.

So I used my experience to back into an interest rate of 1.333% APR and made an amortization table to get the July interest amount - only to learn during the Inventory correction exercise, that (because it divulges the correct total expenses amount) the interest was the same for June and July (not realistic).I hope that someone takes the time to read my NUMEROUS feedbacks and content improvement suggestions, then ACTUALLY has some who didn't write the exercise complete it.Bad.

The lack of quality/accuracy/usefulness of this material is scary since so many people use Intuit products to support their livelihoods. Instructors, your job is not to evade questions or answer with corporate responses like ""We are looking into it"", we know it is not happening. It does not take six months to fix a typo - I know, I wrote training material for a living, but it doesn't take six months. As an instructor, your job is to educate, to guide the learner through the subject. That means actively engaging in discussion and providing more definitive answers to questions. If there is an issue with a question in a quiz or lab, don't just browbeat the learner with some obscure platitude. Instead, since questions are tied to specific sections of the course, suggest to the student they go back to the supporting section for review.Actually create a workbook that has the student apply the concepts taught in all the courses to doing the books for the same company. You kind of did it in the course presentations. This way, the student would have a consistent enviroment to work with eg common set of accounts to be used.R​eview your instructions. They are not clear. They read like somebody rushed through typing something in without thinking about it. if your intending to have something broken in a worksheet, it is best to clearly indicate it, because it is clear that what is presented does not reflect real world. And for learners just starting, that isn't needed. I was shocked at the number of people tagged as unenrolled!D​rop the talking heads.

Students learned how to create journal entries to manage asset depreciation, equipment leases, inventory tracking (including COGS) and promissory notes.  It was beneficial to see the entire accounting process from general journal entries to completion of a balance sheet.  Having said this, I thought it was a very difficult course. Students need to expect to take more time above that to go through the exercises. The course builds on familiar concepts but it gets complicated quickly.   I was able to complete the course only because Coursera was flexible in setting time goals.  FInally, I appreciate that Coursera includes examples of modern and diverse small businesses in this course.  Thank you for making bookkeeping fun!",0,0,Mary Jane Wolff,23361147
