They rush to read through the script without understanding what they are talking about.There was no “energetic music” at the beginning and at the end of each video. The “energetic music” + narrator make it sound like a commercial.“Energetic music” is too loud and terrifies me each time.//Ray Lopez made the material sound authentic, and natural. I could see through Ray Lopez when he was telling stories.Calm, patient, structured.IBM, please, release more courses similar to this and invite Ray Lopez to be the voice of your courses more often!",0,0,Kirill Losik,20888163
