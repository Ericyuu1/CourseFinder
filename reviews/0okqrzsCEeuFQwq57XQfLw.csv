However, overall I felt that the course was not well-organized.From a learner's perspective, I found that there are a lot of small errors in the course quizzes and materials. For instance, there are several questions (in different quizzes) where none of the multiple choice options is correct to answer the question. As well, I feel there there are at times huge leaps in materials and lack of organization in material. There are also a few very short videos for each topic that flies through the materials, but a lot of readings (marked as 10 minutes) to external sources/ Python documentation. I fully expect to do readings but I do feel I benefited more from Googling YouTube videos from the same subject matter for a more in-depth walkthrough and explaination. Lastly, there was very little support provided by the instructor team. There are discussion forums where students were supposed to post their questions. However, the forums are unmonitored and questions are not answered (there were student questions from 2 months ago that did not have any response).  ",0,0,Wing Yee Winnie Chow,92184033
