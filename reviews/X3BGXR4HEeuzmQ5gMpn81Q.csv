Leaving aside the problems with peer marking (I had one assignment returned with zero marks, and no commentary as to why - when I resubmitted exactly the same assignment it passed 19/20!)However I have to say the IBM Cloud (both used directly, and via the course web front end) left a lot to be desired. For example, I had to repeat the work of the final assignment three times and in the end ended up hacking it, in order to bypass IBM Cloud issues. The problem I had was clearly over a year old (looking at the discussions) and the solution in all that time seems to be ....""O​h IBMCloud loses cennection in the CI/CD pipeline - just reconnect them.""I​ lost 8 hours on that!W​ell, lesson learned!
