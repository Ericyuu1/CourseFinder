9139009~COURSE!~NNe5CEW4EeW8ow5lHOiKYQ,1579754675626,1,0,"I'd like to express my sincere appreciation to all the professors, instructors and staffs who had put such great effort in putting together this extensive Specialization.I enjoyed all the contents in this Specialization.However, much as I enjoyed working on the Capstone project, I have to say I found the peer review system to be degrading the overall quality of the course and the Specialization.With peer reviews, you can't guarantee a reasonable and valid evaluation.Firstly, you can't get any meaningful feedback.I found most peers did such quick jobs with the evaluation that out of 12 feedbacks I received throughout the course, there was just one comment that was thought-provoking to some extent. All the rest were something like ""Good job"" and ""I like it"", with something as meaningless as ""N/A"".Secondly, the quality and the validity of the evaluation is in question.As I was evaluating other peer students' works, I came to think some students didn't quite understand the essence of the assignment.  You are asked to propose a strategy for action to solve the problem of ad-blockers. Many of the works I reviewed didn't have sufficient actions to solve it, though.  For example, some proposed to do descriptive analytics.  Doing descriptive analytics alone doesn't solve anything, let alone the ad-blocking problem.The problem here, though, is not that some students are not understanding the essence of business analytics and the assignment associated with it.  It's the fact that those students are evaluating others' works.  I do not see how such students can provide anyone with valid evaluation.In the Forum, I came across a comment from few years back pointing out something similar.  The course instructor answered to that comment, saying students are eligible to review others' works because they completed the series of courses, and thus have the required knowledge.There is a significant difference between figuring out the answers to multiple-choice questions to complete the courses and actually understanding the essence of the business analytics. This is now obvious because I had to give low points to some of peer students.Lastly, the peer review system made the Forum meaningless as well.  The Forum was filled with comments begging for reviews, and it made it almost impossible to find any meaningful discussion about the project.  I think even the instructors gave up on going through the forum to find discussion threads they actually needed to pay attention to.  I asked a simple question about the project description, but no instructor bothered to answer.  I can understand why it occurred, because my question got buried under a pile of review requests soon after I posted it.I took this Specialization with an expectation that I learn from the best.  I hope you revisit the course structure so that the Capstone project, which has a potential of being a great learning experience, would actually be worthy of being a part of this Wharton Specialization.",0,42,Sari Shimizu,9139009

However, the capstone project was a waste of time. Why a company failing in its industry was chosen as the focus is beyond me. In addition, the concepts learned in the previous four courses were only about 1/3 of the requirements of this capstone project - the problem statement and strategy portions could have been done without having taken the four previous courses at all.

These individual courses contained data focused problems and gave a general overview of the specific field.   However, the final ""Capstone"" project was entirely disappointing and something I even plan to complain to Coursera about. After having a two month delay, the course not only lacked any direction, but seemed to be put together last minute without any real thought or plan. The entire ""Capstone"" was driven by hypotheticals, almost all of which did not have any relevance to the past four courses. An educated individual could easily complete this ""Capstone"", without any knowledge whatsoever from the previous four courses. The ""Capstone"" provided a few articles and videos related to the issue (Yahoo Ad Blocker) to help us solve the problem, but clearly the course heavily lacked content. I was expecting the course to contain hypothetical data for us to interact with and predict how the Ad blocker problem and our proposed solutions would drive the data of Yahoo's business. However, the course merely was driven by complete hypotheticals that only required one to be educated about general business functions.

While I personally found doing the activities helpful, the peer review that is used to determine 100% of your grade is not helpful. I experienced a situation in which someone I reported for plagiarism (had literally downloaded someone else's entire project and not bothered to edit their name off of it when submitting) went on to grade TWO of my assignments, and consistently graded me a full point to two points lower than everyone else per question. This included on questions that were not open to interpretation, such as ""were all of the application activities answered?"" Yes, they most certainly were. Did they deduct points? You bet. At best, this is allowing somebody who has no basis to grade things as a peer to determine outcomes for others; at worst, this reads as retaliation, as there are only so many of us taking a course at a time; it's not hard to figure out who might have flagged plagiarism.
