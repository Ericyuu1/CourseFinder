Although it is a choice to learn the characters, it should be more emphasised throughout the course.Otherwise, a great course for those who want to keep on learning Mandarin Chinese from the first course in the series. I found it highly enjoyable and would recommend this course series to others who want to begin learning Mandarin Chinese.Cheers.",0,0,Chris Airey,33010049

But this course​(maybe all courses of this university)​ needs peer-grade review from friends who attend in the same course.It's​ need to wait for friend to peer-grade and also we need to review for 3 friends.

The peer-reviewed assignment is a GREAT idea, but it seems it's being abused. Everyone was posting like songs and music clips or even nothing at all and asking people to review it in the forums. I only found one person who actually did it to review, and I clicked on a couple dozen. It's a real shame.",0,1,Christopher Walker,35062118
