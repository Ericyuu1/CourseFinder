3205089~COURSE!~ga_Dkz8sEeeyvhI1Uz685A,1644853075866,3,0,"Principles and Patterns of Pedagogy seemed to me ideal for a beginner to learn about best practices of each pedagigical approach. But I missed examples for best practices for each type of bedagogy. Example: Didactic pedagogy is ideal for learning new mathematical formulas in case of young students, and the ideal best practices within this type of pedagogy is: A), B) and C). This course did presented some characteristics of each pedagogy, and their history, but without training the typical best practices of each. It is like taking a basic course for learning car driving, and resulting in listening to a historical and sociological discussion about cars. This course was a delivered as a list of presentations. With more exercises between the videos, I would define it as typical didactical approach.  From the contents submitted by learners, 50 % of the learners applied the learned definitions (didactic, authentic, new learning etc) in a wrong way. I am quite disappointed.",0,0,Daniel Shavit,3205089
