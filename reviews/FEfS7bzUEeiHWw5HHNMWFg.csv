4713741~COURSE!~FEfS7bzUEeiHWw5HHNMWFg,1553514234272,2,0,"This course was disappointing overall.  There is nothing you will learn, which wasn't covered in the previous two course.  Far worse, the review is done in the same sequence as the other two courses, so there really is never a chance to combine what was learned.  The challenges will be in the same order as the previous challenges, so don't expect any synthesis of skills you have developed.  There are two bigger problems, but it feels as if this course should have been a series of these.  If you are about to be billed again, there is no real reason to complete this third course.",0,1,Michael Krummel,4713741
6033269~COURSE!~FEfS7bzUEeiHWw5HHNMWFg,1610377951715,4,0,I initially just wanted to get in more practice a week before my Base programming SAS exam so I enrolled via the audit feature just to get free access to the programming questions. I found them really helpful and passed my exam. Even though I passed my exam I decided to enroll in the course because I wanted to keep my SAS programming skills and knowledge in practice and up to date. The programming projects during weeks 3 and 6 were excellent in letting me demonstrate my skills to real-world data.,0,0,Sankalp Pandya,6033269
