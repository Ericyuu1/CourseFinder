I really enjoyed watching the interviews with brilliant professionals working in various fields in relation to women's health and rights. I also enjoyed that it gets an in-depth approach to examine important issues. I have definitely learnt a lot!Two weaknesses of this course however are:1. It is not up-to-date, most of the materials (with data) provided are obsolete. It's still interesting to build general knowledge on an issue or better understand the theoretical aspects, however it is not reliable when it comes to data (since the course was prepared 10 years ago). That's quite problematic for some issues such as girls' education, where today's situation is certainly not the same as 10-15 years ago. If the course were updated, it would be an outstanding course!2. As stated in other comments, it is unfortunate that the time allocation for reading materials is not accurate on the platform. Each document is estimated to be a 10-minute reading, but it takes much more time to go through all the materials and lengthy reports provided each week.
