Homework assignments are just a repeat of the lectures and take less than an hour if you took notes on the lectures. In other words, there is no value in the homework assignments. The first two courses in this specialization were awesome. We did real life examples for homework assignments and through research you learned more than you had asked for. It was perfect. Even in lectures, there is nothing 'applied' about this course. The professor just covers the content with no real-life examples. Very mundane and unexciting.Also, why not talk about multi-label classification? Professor takes a real example with multiple labels (handwritten digits), makes it a binary class and then proceeds to explain it... Thanks. My recommendation would be to restructure the homework assignments. Instead of having 7 questions that spoon-fed you the solution of a primitive problem, ask us to do some Kaggle challenges, or give us a topic that we go out and solve, do some peer-reviewed assignment. Lastly, if you don't have time or don't want to explain important concepts like pipeline, nested cross validation, and multi-label classification, add them as resources.

Also, he makes you question if he really knows what he is talking about. I am sure he does but his attitude and sloppy mistakes give you doubt. The format of the video lectures is that the lecturer reads a script in front of the camera and the algorithm he talks about is shown in cutscenes. This is a terrible idea. Also, the courses are not well prepared, lacking continuity. On top of that lecturer often makes mistakes and these mistakes are ""corrected"" by showing you a cutscene that writes the professor wanted to say X instead of Y. This is really sloppy. This is not an open course where you put your recorded lectures to youtube for free. You are delivering these lectures to paying customers.

I would compare this course to the reading of a textbook. There was very little focus on making sense of the code and solving real-world problems and far too much emphasis on shotgunning (what felt like) every single classification technique known to man and trivializing pros and cons of each method. To make matters even more strange, PCA and other useful methods were pushed into ""optional"".

The good aspects -
- This course served as a good refresher for traditional ML concepts like Regression, Classification, and Model Evaluation, along with hands-on exercises in Python.
- Assignments need effort, have good exercises & force you to think. You cannot simply watch the lectures & complete them straight away.
- I especially liked the module about Data Leakages and how it impacts our model's performance.
 
Scope for Improvement -
- Some concepts like Classification models are explained pretty well whereas others such as Regression, and Unsupervised learning (Clustering, Anomaly Detection) are quite rushed.
- There are some obvious errors in the assignments and auto-grader, missing files, some clearly vague questions. The discussion forum is riddled with similar questions for these errors - they could have fixed it years ago but chose not to.
- Not much depth in the topics - beginners will have difficulty understanding pitfalls of certain models, how real-world data mining works, and how to select features and models.
 
 If you're a beginner - it will give you a good overview of traditional ML models and implementation in Python. Good to try, but you need to spend a lot of time for self-learning the concepts, specially the mathematics behind these algorithms.",0,0,Shubham Jha,38038839

The professor seems to be reading out from a teleprompter in a flat pitch.There are parts where the intuition behind the concepts are well explained and others where you are left staring at stars and better off learning from other sources over the net.

The discussion forums keep getting spammed on similarly asked questions which can be easily solved by correcting the assignment errors and providing a few clearer comments/instructions.

No one else to moderate the forums.The course pace is quite uneven and patchy. Week 2 is extremely heavy while week 1 super light. Week 3 is good but week 4 feels half done/rushed.

However, I thought the lectures in particular were needlessly more abstract than the previous data science courses in this specialization. In my experience, learning a new programming concept comes from practically writing code then observing what happened. The earlier data science courses were great because you could test code with the lecturer as the video progressed and learn from it.  The lecture content here structured to discuss broader machine learning concepts, rather than setup to follow along in the notebook. I found this was okay for introducing the idea of different machine learning concepts, though without the practical application and observation it became difficult to remember these concepts or test what I was hearing. I found most of my learning happened in the assignments or by following more practical online resources. The course could be improved by tying the notebook modules more closely to the video content, making it easier for learners to follow along.",0,0,Jonathan Brinias,20266036

The focus is to have hand-on experience with the sklearn library.I don't grant 5 starts (I hesitated for 4), as the course was designed back in 2018, therefore, you sometimes struggle with legacy libraries. Another issue, is that there are some hiccups when it comes to assignment uploads (for instance, the address of csv files!). As a student, this will make you hesistate and question wether the instructor screwed up with the autograder or not, which IS stressful.Quiz 4 suddenly became non-forgiving, multiple choice answer have to be answered with 100% certainity to score full point. Quite anti-climatic, considering that previous quizes didn't work like that.Final assignment is quite challenging, and might make the new student suffer.I appreciate the instructors and Kevyn Collins for this great course. Now that I have a better picture, I get insights on how to focus my research efforts in sensor research and development.",0,0,Martín Jiménez Moreno,69590069

Assignment is good enough for reinforcement learning and definitely better planned. I also appreciate the link to additional readings which are quite informative. Cons: Assignment auto-grader. This  is still the biggest letdown of all the courses in this specialization Codes which work on your laptop or suggested elsewhere on Stackoverflow etc fails to pass the autograder, so 30-40% of the time of the assignment is spent on wrangling the code to pass the autograder.

Otherwise this will not be  a pleasant experience for you.  As far as I am concerned,  I worked it along with several books and this course helped me learn quick and effective hands-on machine learning  skills, to complement my theoretical knowledge.   If you are a complete beginner in ML, this is clearly not a stand-alone course and you will need, for example, to refer to either Andrew Ng's coursera course on machine learning or to Christopher Bishop's book (as I did).  Overall, I consider this course has helped me a lot  and I learned a huge amount of useful things and good practices.  I now feel confident enough  to apply for jobs in the ML field,  which is what I enrolled (and paid) for.  Nevertheless,  I would have appreciated  a  dedicated section  specifically on how to  handle categorical variables.  This matter is not really treated throughout the 4 weeks and I think it would have been a better choice to include it  instead of the very superficial optional introduction to Deep learning.

I finished the course feeling equipped and confident enough to take on straightforward machine learning projects from start to finish. I've dropped a star because the autograder uses an older version of Python and older libraries, which meant I had to spend around 8 hours re-engineering my *correct* code to conform to old libraries.Addendum: I've uprated the course to 5 stars after having just completed the fifth, optional week on unsupervised learning.

Finally, the accompanying Jupyter Notebooks are very helpful and there are many helpful links to outside resources as well.A few of the lecture videos feel like an early draft rather than production-quality, with lots of time spent on repeating phrases. The instructor mentions things to be covered ""later,"" but that ""later"" never comes (for example, in discussing Grid Search).
