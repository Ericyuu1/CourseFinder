I work in clay, book arts and textiles and the Japanese aesthetic - both directly through studying Japanese art but also through the art movements in the West that have been so influenced by Japan. This course reminds me of how much. I particularly enjoyed the degree to which Dr. Campbell is exploring ideas, enquiring, exposing his thought processes rather than having a set of didactic goals.  These feel like living ideas - even his use in some cases of items from his own collection - rather than an academic review of the classic examples. It would have been a delight to be in a seminar with him to discussl the thoughts his presentations have triggered and explore more examples. Ah, well, the limit of online learning. I will say the actual graded tests were a little tricky - some questions required reasoning - not just looking for ""the answer"" I liked that!One disappointment when comparing the discussion portion of the class with my experiences on Coursera several years ago is indeed the lack of lively feedback in the discussion section. There were questions posed, information souoght but no reply. Interaction with the professor graduate students and other participants was stellar -but that was during the development stage of MOOCs, and for a free course that would be unreasonable. It just would have been nice to see the answers to interesting questions. But that won't stop me from taking another course.Regardless, as a continuing education course it was very interesting and thought provoking.
