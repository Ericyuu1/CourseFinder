Thanks a lot to the instructors for putting so much effort in preparing it! Although having worked with optimization for a few years, I could learn a lot from this course. For someone aiming at learning optimization, there are not many well-structured courses/resources available; and this is surely one of the best resources I have found in years. The course is difficult - much more difficult than other data science courses on Coursera - and thus requires many hours, good programming skills, and some dedication. But for me it was surely worth it!My only remark/negative feedback is the lack of guidance - especially at the very beginning - on what external resources students are supposed to use for the assignments. I understand that this is in part intentional in order to make the course more challenging; however, compared to other courses I took, I feel that here the guidance is sometimes excessively little, and it is quite easy to get stuck on a given exercise. I honestly felt a bit lost at the beginning, and doubted whether it made sense to continue the course. Also, having access or not to licences of professional tools can make a significant difference in the level of difficulty of the assignments (implementing from scratch some solvers is, in some cases, a rather difficult task, which also requires quite advanced programming skills). I really think that providing more guidance/instructions on this would be of very high benefit here. There is actually a video which partly addresses this point, but it is only at the end of Week 3 (I guess many people abandon before having seen it - I recommend students to watch it at the very beginning).Also, possibly related to this, my feeling is that currently the course is far less active than in the last years; the forums are not very active, and very seldom instructors/tutors intervene in the discussion.",0,2,Stefano Moret,29068818

I personally enjoyed the their structure, which was highly computational and focused on output without restricting your choice of approach.  Each student could choose either to stick with tool that they are already comfortable with, or break out and experiment with something new.  (For me, that was Mixed Integer Programming tools like Pyomo, GLPK and XPress.)
The note that the assignments will take 12-15 hours per week is something to factor in.  If you're someone who suffers from 'just one more run to improve this score' syndrome, you will likely spend that time and more.  The lectures were very informative about the topics, and Prof. von Hentenryck had an engaging style.  It is clear he has tought this course many times and has polished both the material and his presentation of it.  M​y only criticism is that at the end of the course, the material started getting into esoterica about specific problems, e.g. hyper-specific algorithms for handling the travelling saleman problem.  While interesting, it raised more questions than it answered in my mind; it could have been left out of the course without affecting the student experience.  ",0,0,Alan Ableson,2218868

40829518~COURSE!~THkzKaBPEeWm9xJA1YXcWQ,1628467226525,5,0,"My master's internship involved developing and improving an existing planning system, in its underlying it uses optimization to solve rich VRP problems. After I finished my thesis I kept working with VRP and optimisation. We develop tailored models for specific problems of our clients. From my experience, an optimization method is not enough to solve a problem, sometimes we have to use CP, SAT solvers, dynamic programming to solve sub-problems. One example is distributing products by compartments for fuel and liquids transports.
This course was amazing and real shows what is intractability and NP-Hardness, for simple problems but with an huge temporal growth in optimization time. I'm familiar with some local search algorithms, but I had never understood the real difference between LP, MIP and CP. This course gave me a clean explanation of the principles behind this solvers.
Regarding the assignments, the grading system is amazing. I did not spend more than a day in each assignment, but I hope in the future to have some time to improve the algorithms.

His excitement and passion are palpable in his lectures and his team has clearly put in a ton of effort into creating all the graphics, images, etc. to make the illustrations as lucid as possible. Make no mistake - despite the simplicity of the problems you learn (in terms of how you can state them), this can be a very tough course. The positive side is that depending on your goals (do you want to learn the heuristics of discrete programming, or get your hands dirty with the details?), all of the problems in this course can easily be solved with an optimization framework (e.g. Python OR-tools, Julia JuMP). However, it's like Professor Hentenryck says, the real fun of the course is trying to approach the problems you learn from different angles. I first solved each problem through the basic approaches, but always went back to try something else and that's truly what made the course so enjoyable - by the end, you really feel as though you have a toolbox of optimization knowledge at your disposal!",0,2,Brian Hsu,25487248

17997926~COURSE!~THkzKaBPEeWm9xJA1YXcWQ,1585257118629,5,0,"One of the best courses I've ever taken, including all my main studies in three different universities. Don't expect to breeze through this course with some easy multiple choice questionnaires - the professor is not kidding in the beginning when he says the course is hard. It actually took me 3 years of on-and-off, admittedly sporadic efforts to get through the course with more than a few times when I questioned whether I would ever finish it. What kept me coming back every time though was knowing that this is a course where your efforts pay off highly in learning - coding the algorithms yourself is obviously more demanding then getting handed something already working, but at the same time this is simply the best way to learn. Pedagogically everything is set up ideally for the motivated learner - the lectures are inspiring (even entertaining!) and focus on the key ideas behind the methods rather than obscure equations. After getting through the lectures of a section and getting the programming assignment in front of you (which are superbly designed with the online grading system working flawlessly), you should have conceptually a solid basis for starting to start writing your optimisation algorithm (actually, in many cases you would have several algorithm classes to choose from and in the end especially towards the last few assignments I had to implement several different algorithms for the different individual problems of the assignment to get a passing score). The learning curve is perfectly set up with each successive assignment being a bit harder than the one before it (and also a bit more rewarding once you finally manage to get through it). Finally, it's certainly worth it to read through the informative discussion forums to get new ideas when you get stuck in an assignment. The bottom line is that if you are interested in learning about discrete optimisation and are motivated enough to spend the fairly significant amount of time and effort required, then you simply couldn't ask for a better course than this - thanks so much to the course staff for making this amazing course available on Coursera!",0,15,Tommi Jokela,17997926

Interesting lectures, problems to solve, etc. Small improvement in my opinion can be achieved in two areas:1. I could not get used to instructor's showmanship and he sometimes covers up the slides. 2. I would suggest changing submission format not to post code but solution. In this case we would not be limited in programming language's choice. ",0,0,Marcin Woch,11245953
2300322~COURSE!~THkzKaBPEeWm9xJA1YXcWQ,1480030026857,5,0,"While doing Tim Roughgarden's Algorithms  course (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) I became interested about the topic of solving NP-hard problems and wanted more. That's how I bumped into this course. I'm VERY happy I did. I never had so much fun programming since I was in high school.  The assignments are tough and time consuming and  super addictive. Don't be surprised if you find yourself at 5:00 AM trying to squeeze a slightly better solution then what you currently have.The course covers a lot of material: constraint programming, local search heuristics and meta-heuristics, linear and mixed integer programming. I think each of these topics could be extended and made into separate course. If you want to get a thorough understanding of all of the presented topics, you're gonna have to go through the additional materials. However, prof. Pascal Van Hentenryck is an excellent teacher so even though you don't have a thorough understanding of everything, things are gonna make sense and feel very natural and intuitive. Dr. Carleton Coffrin is also very active on the forums, constantly answering questions or encouraging interesting conversations. I've never seen a MOOC which such actively involved staff.Bottom line, if you have10+ hours/week and you like CS, definitely take this one.",0,1,Ioan Alexandru Cucu,2300322
