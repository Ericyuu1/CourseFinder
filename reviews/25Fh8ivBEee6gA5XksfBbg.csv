6680037~COURSE!~25Fh8ivBEee6gA5XksfBbg,1668031364941,1,0,"The good: Videos with a great overview of the theory, and some of the applications.The bad: Everything else, I wouldn´t recommend this course. The quizzes are labs are very buggy. Labs are boring and very rigid (maybe because of coursera's platform?), I don't see the point of keeping testing (through all 5 courses in the specialization) if the student is capable of replacing a None in a variable declaration or a loop, while the whole preprocessing of the data is done automatically. Also, I found out that the last lab was literally taken from the tensor flow examples page and they just changed some variable names or replaced variable values with None. The change of paradigm in the last lab is also hard to understand. It seems they needed to ""fill in"" some content in order to ""update"" the course, I felt very dissapointed since transformers was something I was looking forward to learn.After 5 courses the classes become very tedious, and the way Andrew present seems very old-fashion for a topic in the technology field. I mean, there's more appealing ways to teach computer/data science than with power point slides while writing on top of them.

In many cases it is quite unclear how those classes are supposed to be handled in the context of our task. There are some hints but those are mostly links to documentation (btw, some of the links are no longer up to date), but it is often not too well explained which properties those objects have, what one can do etc. so one ends up with trying using those objects in different configuarations, then googling around, looking on the course forum for the right answer but it is very difficult to derive it. There should be more precise instructions regarding handling Keras objects - the examples in the documentation and in blogs are often much simpler than those from assignments so one ends up not knowing what is going on.

Also, he variously describes the embeddings as the ""input"" and the ""parameters"" of this neural network, even though those are clearly two different things.

The content delivery was excellent. I am not sure how unfeasible it was to re-produce the videos, though it would have been nice to see fewer corrections. In regards to the programming assignments, I think that they are great overall. The way the code was mostly pre-filled to ensure logical workflow helped me to stay on track rather than trying to skip straight to the final model (I assume beginner programmers do this a lot). It provided a great template for thought and I will definitely be referring back regularly. However, I also think that descriptions and exercises could be integrated better, especially in the later assignments where students are compiling more complex models and prior skills in programming (from earlier courses) are expected. Specifically, there are certain Exercise descriptions with multiple parts 1a,b,c 2a,b,c etc and hints before you even get to the start of the actual implementation. I think this is inefficient and was a bit frustrating at times. It felt a bit disjointed and overwhelming to read the instructions without no context (i.e. reading about step 2c before implementing step 1a).

Many topics are explained clearly, with valuable field practitioners insight, and you are given quizzes and code-exercises that help deepen the understanding of how to implement the concepts in the videos. I would recommend to take them after the initial Andrew Ng ML course by Stanford, unless you have prior background in this topic.There are a few shortbacks:1 - the video editing is poor and sloppy. Its not too bad, but it’s sometimes can be a bit annoying.2 - most of the exercises are too easy, and are almost copy-paste. I need to go over them and create variations of them in-order to strengthen my practical skills. Some exercises are quite challenging though (especially in course 4 and 5), and I need to go over them just to really nail them down, as things scale up quickly. Course 3 has no exercises as its more theoretical. Some exercises have bugs - so make sure to look at the discussion board for tips (the final exercise has a huge bug that was super annoying).3 - there are no summary readings - you have to (re)watch the videos in order to check something, which is annoying. This is partially solved because the exercises themselves usually hold a lot of (textual) summary, with equations.4 - the 3rd course was a bit less interesting in my opinion, but I did learn some stuff from it. So in the end it’s worth it. 5 - Slide graphics and Andrew handwriting could be improved. 6 - the online Coursera Jupyter notebook environment was a bit slow, and sometimes get stuck.

Usually when it does require a specific value for the argument (e.g. axis=x), it will be mentioned either in the text or code comments. I guess it's a good challenge, but I find myself doing more trial-and-error with the coding to get it to work instead of having some guidance on how to use those Keras objects/layers. The discussion forums do help, however. Lastly, some of the assignments involved building a recurrent model using Keras layers, I felt like there was not enough explanation why such architecture, layers, or hyperparameter values were chosen.Overall, I liked the course, I did learn a lot from the course, and enjoyed the models we get to play with in the assignments. I think I will still run into problems trying to devise my own sequence models, and fumble with Keras. I wish there is a more in-depth course on the sequence model.

The discourse forum is turning the potential disaster of questions into the joy of exploring and gain of problem solving.First, mentors response questions fast. Second, they analyze questions very patiently and carefully, no matter it seems big or small. Last but not the least, they encourage a lot, which cultivates a free environment to ask, to explore, to experiment, and to share.Here I give all my credit to the lesson team and the discourse team, they're the best dancing partner to each other.

I did already the NLP Specialization of DeepLearning.AI and wanted to learn more about the inner workings of neural nets and I was not a single minute disappointed by my decision! Extremely well done overall! In particular the course on Sequence models is very enjoyable and will give you all the tools and intuition necessary to understand the background and the basis of such models and how they work! You even have a last week on Attention-based models, which is a little bit introductory, given that Attention as a concept exploded after this course was developed. Nevertheless, it is very well executed! My only critique is that, the whole specialization was developed before TensorFlow 2.0, and later on it the assignments were ported and Keras is used. But during the lectures on will not find any introduction to Keras and all this content is left for the assignments. This requires from the student more effort to understand and use Keras. What can be a bit frustrating, because Keras API also evolved during this time. I would suggest adding a couple of videos or ungraded labs in order to teach the student a bit better how to use the framework. But well, this is a minor issue. 5 Stars are for the overall amazing presentation of what is indeed important, the Deep Learning fundamentals. Moreover, Andrews last video is just very much aspiring and a powerful message that everyone in the field should come in contact with! Congrats! I hope the team plan to execute soon an updated version of the specialization in order to incorporate the new advances and to adapt it to the newest DL Framework.

The details can be always looked up elsewhere.I can't imagine how much effort it took to create high quality slides, transcripts and WELL-DOCUMENTED CODE(!) in the notebooks. Being a software engineer, I can't stress the importance of a good documentation enough.Since the notebooks already propose a well-designed NN architecture which gets the job done, what I'd like to see is maybe some reasoning about why *this* particular design was chosen, and not some other one.

I think is a great course for everyone that is interested in learning more about this topic and not only the theoretical aspects but also from a practical point of view. Andrew NG does an excellent work by going through the theory and then leaving some time for the practical exercises which are the best and, at the same time, the most challenging part of this specialization. These exercises start with very basic stuff but quickly turn into interesting problems related to convolutional neural networks, face recognition and end up with sequence algorithms for natural language processing.

Some small complaints / recommendations: - Courses don't teach enough Keras & Tensorflow syntax to be completely stand-alone.  If you take this course, you won't really be able to build your own DNN's unless you also take a separate Keras / Tensorflow course.- Links to Keras documentation are broken -- they now take you to the general Keras homepage, not the specific command's page.- In later courses, Andrew Ng's lectures are not edited.  Starting around the 4th course, you start hearing Dr. Ng stop and repeat portions of the lecture, presumably intending the first attempt to be edited out in the future.  Usually this is easy to ignore, but in some cases he repeats 30-60 seconds of lecture, which can be confusing.- In the last course (sequence models), the text captions of Dr. Ng's lecture have a lot of mistakes, which is a little ironic for a course on speech-to-text ",0,0,Sean O'Connor,12994457

I am sure part of the reason is that I was unfamiliar with the technical terms.  Once I switched on the captioning option, my comprehension improved however I noticed an average of at least one translation error per video and these seemed to be caused by the instructor's accent and were sometimes very interesting errors.  So, I guess the system could use a little more training with the specific AI vocabulary and/or adjusting the context error settings for the subject matter.     However, once I had the captioning on, it was harder to follow the notes because sometimes the important information was right under the captions.  What was really helpful was when he summarized with typed versions for two reasons.  One, it was clearer to read and understand.  Second, it was higher on the screen and did not overlap with the captioning.",0,0,Teresa,45456678

The switch from Octave to Python can be a little tricky, but stick with it. Octave allows you to gain a deeper understanding of the Linear Algebra aspects and matrix multiplication than Python does (for me it did anyway).The entire line up of courses prepares you so well to develop an eye for deep learning use cases and gives you the skills necessary to dive in and start applying deep learning solutions to real world scenarios.I'm so proud to have completed this specialization and I cannot wait to start building my own models and come up with ideas to benefit society! :DWith Gratitude,Justin",0,0,Justin Haut,38339970

It is certainly the most difficult one from the whole specialization and has taken me a lot longer than I planned. This is partially due to the fact that focus is shifted a bit more towards the programming assignments and concepts that are only briefly mentioned in the lectures turn out to be crucial for the assignments. The forum helps a lot, without it I would not have  been able to crack the first week, especially the optional parts of the assignments. There were also a few errors in derivation formulas, that had set me back, but in the end I understood the concepts a lot better and found some nice complementary resources online. And the RNNs are more complex and seem more variable than other network architectures, so that is ok that this course is more difficult. Now I feel that I finally have a good grasp of Deep Learning concepts and have a nice set of skills. And the assignments are super fun and very useful.

They take away the dirty work from you but make sure you get how you would do it. At the end you get to work with pretty complex setups like the attention model, but you still get the feeling of knowing how it ticks from the very bottom up.The actual merit is that, even if it feels simple, it actually does work and is a takeaway knowledge that can be directly applied for personal setups.

I am a working professional (13+ years), but just getting into the field of ML and AI. Apologies for flashing this preamble for every course that I review on coursera.This course is the 5th and final one in a 5 part series offered by Dr. Andrew Ng on deep learning on coursera. I believe it is useful to take this course in order and it makes sense to study it as a part of the series, though technically that is not necessary.This is one of the best courses to take if you want to understand the basics of Sequence Models (Recurrent Neural Networks). RNN is a technically-difficult-to-understand, still-evolving field of Neural Networks, and it has thus far found remarkable uses in a wide variety of field, ranging from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to Voice-to-Text conversion and Music Synthsis, to name a few. Dr. Ng really exposes us to this cutting edge research, by explaining research papers that were only recently published. By now, I could see how the problems would be tackled.  However, there are several subtle aspects, such as the optimal metrics to use, the clever modification in the NN architecture, etc. which Dr. Ng drew attention to and made clear.The instructor videos are very good, usually 10 min long, and Dr. Ng tries hard to provide intuition using analogies and real-life examples. The quizzes that accompany the lectures are quite challenging and help ensure that the student has understood the material well. As with the other courses, the programming exercises are the best part of the course. You get to practice, (1) Music synthesis, (2) NLP and Sentiment Analysis, (3) Trigger Word Detection (Hello Google, Hey Siri, Alexa!), ... All these problems are actual, real-life projects, which are extremely difficult to solve. They help the student practice the strategies and also provide a jump-start for the student to use the code for their own problems at work or in school.Overall, this is an excellent course. Thank you Dr Ng and the teaching assistants, Thank you coursera.I HAVE A HUGE GRIPE WITH COURSERA's TECHNICAL SUPPORT.  THEY DO NOT HAVE A READILY AVAILABLE TECH-SUPPORT EMAIL ID.  YOU HAVE TO SEARCH THROUGH THE WEBSITE CAREFULLY TO FIND A CHAT LINK. I HAVE RECOMMENDED COURSERA TO SEVERAL FRIENDS AND MANY OF THEM ARE VERY UPSET AT THE SUBSCRIPTION POLICY, WHICH IS SNEAKY.  IN FACT THE WORDING IS ALMOST DESIGNED TO CHEAT YOU.I have been a huge supporter of Coursera and hate to give this negative feedback here.

2091258~COURSE!~25Fh8ivBEee6gA5XksfBbg,1523802087755,5,0,"A year ago I was basically ""on blank"" in regards of Machine Learning.I've started ""my journey"" on ML about 9 months ago, with a text book I've got on Amazon called ""Data Mining, Practical Machine Learning Tools and Techniques"", Self taught I've read, transcribed, done some math, covered the half of it. But I needed something more practical to speed up, so I've tried also with the coursesfrom ""Super Data Science""'s team on Udemy, but found them to be too focused on practice rather than deep reasoning of it (I might be wrong but that's the impression I had); So I needed more formal, University-like.I've decided to try out Andrew's first course on Machine Learning (with Matlab), which gave me much greater view and understanding, had my head melting specially on weeks 4-6, but after finishing the course I've felt I did finally know what ML was! but still there was ""a lot missing"", given the course was already a bit old, and the technology had developed greatly since then.Fortunately to me, I've found out about this specialisation right after I've finished the first course and I've signed up immediately. Today (14.4.2018) I've finished the second specialisation. After 6 months of continuos dedication, doing the first 3 month course, plus this 3 month specialisation.Homeworks in Matlab and Python were my next challenge, even I'm a developer for 15 years (C# / Java, C). Combining a lot of new theory in a new language made it harder but also satisfying.I'm the kind of person that needs to understand why things work as they work, that might be my weakness but also my strength; It's not enough for me to drive the car, but I need to know how to tune it. I must tell that for example, a video/lecture of 15 minutes meant to me usually 60 minutes of work, transcribing, doing the math, etc. That made my 6 months particularly long..",0,0,Alejandro Alemán,2091258

Dr. Ng introduces you to state-of-the-art CNN and Sequence models which are quite complex.  But he expertly presents it to you so that you can focus on the essential aspects and not the details.  In courses 1-3, you might feel like you're being spoon-fed in the assignments but it is really a great approach to ease you into the deep learning field.  In courses 4 and 5, there is less guidance so that you can become more independent and be able to figure things out on your own.  After all, this is how it will be in our future jobs - no more TA's then.  One thing I really appreciated in this specialization was the use of good notation.  For me this was very important because it made it easier to apply theory into practice (via the assignments).  Another thing is the amazing selection CNN and sequence model topics that were covered.  Because of this, I now have a good idea where to focus my future projects/work.  I also loved the assignments because they helped me understand the concepts much better.       For future students, please note that there are mini tutorials for Python (in Course 1), TensorFlow (in Course 2), and Keras (in Course 4).
