The cited sources have no clickable links and it is exhausting to manually type in the URLS by hand to read the articles that are exhausting to read anyways. I pay a university to efficiently spoon feed me information in a topic that is otherwise difficult to broach alone, yet I find myself spoonfeeding the shortcomings of this course. I find I am meticulously piecing together viable interpretations of information that should otherwise be given to me in a competent and organized fashion. Too much focus in 'streamlining' the course material, not enough focus on providing it. Regrettably, this course also does not acknowledge the existence of useful opensource fpga tools for this course like Logsim or open source hardware like icebreaker bitsy.

Without sharing the MOTIVATION of doing something, how can you expect students to develop interest in minute details? Sure, you learn something along the way (like some tools and how to operate an INTEL software) because you have to complete the assigments. But that is not enjoyable at all. I have a strong background and experience in digital electronics and microcontrollers. Still I couldn't follow many of the things in this course because it was so hapazard. The interesting and important topics such as ""timing constraints problem"" was not explained at all in details. There are some diagrams and the instructor is like a computer generated voice narrating the slides. Look at some lectures by professors such as gregory plett from colorado boulder - learn from them how to teach a new concept.

The first is that the transcription is not where it needs to be, and the resolution of the videos does not compensate for the problem. Filenames are often very important and need to be exact. Yet the transcription often makes mistakes with the filenames and variables. This is where the lack of Youtube resolution comes into play. I can't read individual file and variable names, The result is a lot of guesswork. This could be overcome with high resolution scans of the RTL level diagrams provided the scans were of high enough resolution to read the file and vairable names. Further the class runs on an old version of Quartus Prime, 16.1 while the current version of Quartus is 20.1 (as of this writing).

The material covered in week 3 is very repetitive and could easily be learned by the students just by looking at datasheets.
