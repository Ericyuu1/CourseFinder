56338484~COURSE!~rUHfSakHEeeQ3gpuC4Fs_g,1651314080217,1,0,"OOF. A lot of blatantly incorrect information. I know that positive psychology is widely touted as scientific and evidence-based, but genuinely so many of these studies are HIGHLY flawed and limited. Many people have actual problems in their lives and know that, no, they do not react ""better"" to  setbacks. Certainly if you are extremely privileged, like a number of people in these studies, certain setbacks might not be as devastating. I don't know anyone who reacts better to problems they assume will devastate them. Oftentimes people have to bry their pain and move on. It doesn't mean they are *happier* than they expect. 

So many bizarre assumptions were made in examples as well. Like how a bad grade won't harm you in the longterm because your friends will take you out and you'll feel better in no time. Huh? First of all, you have a supportive group of friends who I assume have the time and can afford to take you out to cheer you up. Second this grade is apparently not bad enough to bring down your average so badly that you can never recover. Nor does it make you lose a scholarship or have to drop out of school or start a cascade of events that affects your career. Nor does it apparently demoralize you as you try to overcome it. This is a fantasy world, but it's presented as scientific fact? I could not finish. I skimmed through to see if there were other ideas I might consider helpful to find a list of recommendations that I could find in any meditation app and in almost every ""wellness"" article. Frankly baffled as to why this course, which was recommened to me, is so extraordinarily popular.",0,3,Noelle Matteson,56338484

There was way too little discussion about the intensity of the conflict between the things that make humans happy and the real world context of our lives. Without this, there seems to be too little acknowledgement of the challenge facing those who want to be happy in today's world and therefore the recommendations in the course come across as rather pollyannaish. Yes, you can empty a cup of water with a spoon - but if you're confronting a tidal wave, a spoon isn't going to be all that helpful.Much of the data and literature used in the course is quite dated. As such, I didn't have a high level of confidence that the conclusions were really supported by a wide and continuing body of literature or whether they were simply cherry-picked to support the professor's views. (I also wondered how many of the referenced social science experiments were replicable.)The software was a bit glitchy at times. Delays in elements being marked completed, etc. Could use some improvement.I also thought the professor waffled more than a bit on the issue of social media. If social media is really making people intensely unhappy, say so - and then ask yourself how easy it would be to attend an modern academic institution without access to social media. (And, BTW, what's Yale doing about it?) On the upside, the price is right for this online course.

forum.  Obviously, the course generated
lots of curiosity and interest in understanding the science behind happiness
and well-being.I was surprised and somewhat dismayed at the videos by Professor
Santos. The presentation technique was somewhat disconnected and
having her look away so often to a screen for her discussion notes was distracting.
 I would have preferred more interaction and
commentary from the attending students that were present during the video recording.Three things stood out immediately during the course.First, much of the research data presented was very outdated,
and most likely would not be as relevant today 2020.  The research also appeared to be limited to college
or university level age groups.  I suspect
that what an 18 to 21-year old student may feel or be cognizant of, relative to
their happiness, is way different than a 30 to 40-year old professional typical
working class American. Although I enjoyed the candidness, the other more profound distraction
was the course material presentation and the continuous verbal speech disfluency.The use of the word “like” spoken thousands of times during
the videos and discourse was disconcerting to see in a #4 ranked national university.Much of the talk was like watching a junior high-level social
interaction – this includes, disappointedly, Professor Santos’s use of the word
like as well.If this is what university level education allows and that
is how a Yale senior student communicates, I would not be spending my money to
send my child to that university.Effective verbal communications are as important as any
other learned skill in business or any profession.And lastly, Professor Santos’s cadence could be slowed down somewhat
to increase comprehension of the information, especially the describing of the
science research data.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the course and how it
progressed.  It opened my eyes to what
can affect my Happiness and Well-being, and what I can do to modify my behavior. ",0,0,Randall Ring,13907902

There is so much more to it, and life is so more more nuanced than this. It may help to put into practice some specific  goals but that doesn’t make people “happy.” I appreciated the course information though and genuinely learned some things that I hadn’t known.

As someone who has been suffering from depression and anxiety since I was a child, I think it would have been beneficial to talk more about how these rewirements can benefit those suffering from mental issues (I felt it was addressed as an afterthought...).  Depression and anxiety have increased dramatically during the pandemic so these mental issues warrant a more prominent place in the discussion of well-being. From my experience, habit-forming works with concentrating on one small task or goal at a time to avoid getting easily overwhelmed and discouraged. I was surprised that this wasn't mentioned. I was also surprised that practicing self-compassion wasn't mentioned as that is another mental hurdle that many struggle to overcome in forming a habit/rewirement.Anyway, just my two cents.

Ich glaube, es hängt stark davon ab, wo man sich gerade selber befindet auf der Zufriedenheit-Skala. Und eben auch davon, ob man sich bereits auf anderen Wegen mit den Bereichen Zufriedenheit, Achtsamkeit, Entfaltung etc. befasst hat. Für einige wird dieser Kurs ganz neue, wunderbare Welten eröffnen - für andere gibt er sehr gute Erklärungen für Dinge, die man auch vorher schon geahnt oder gewusst hat. Es geht bei “The Science of Well-Being” aber eben ausdrücklich nicht darum, wie seelisch kranke oder eingeschränkte Personen kuriert werden können, sondern eher darum, wie man seinem Leben einen Zufriedenheits-Boost geben kann. Hierfür findet man in diesem Kurs sehr anschaulich und nachvollziehbar Werkzeuge und wissenschaftliche Hintergründe an die Hand. Der Kurs kann der Startschuss sein für ein zufriedeneres Leben - es kommt aber danach darauf an, das Gelernte auch wirklich langfristig in die Praxis zu überführen. ",0,0,Christoph Seeger,58406062

The presentations are all well done and easy to watch. I only have one critique and that is the forum or discussion area. When I searched a specific term I noticed that there are posts from previous years or threads that were started years ago. I did set reminders to some discussions at the beginning but did not like the constant irrelevant comments. And found that in the first few weeks the engagement was better than closer to the end of course.

Dr. Santos did a great job explining the content and relating it to everyday situations. I enjoyed her guest speakers who shared their ideas and findings.My only complaint is that I thought I had met all of my requirements then spent a lot of time figuring out that I had missed pushing the button saying that I had completed the section.  I feel that the computer should not let you advance to the next week if everything hasn't been recorded as complete.  I also strugged with how to find my peer's rewirement repsonses so that I could review them.  Easier navigation in the computer program could have saved me time and allowed me to complete the course in a more timly fashion.,0,0,Becky Hodgson,108997256

I first took this course (at Coursera) in January 2020, and finished it just before COVID19 changed our world. I used and applied what I learned on a daily basis and it helped me maintain my sanity and overall well-being. I used my re-wirements daily: Meditation, gratitude, savoring, and improved my sleep patterns. In addition, I took the social media challenge AND removed my social media apps from my cell phone and have not put them back on since. I still only log in from my laptop. I don't think I could have done as well during the pandemic without the skills I learned in this class. I pledge to continue this practice. Fast forward to January 2022, I've just taken the course again. I reviewed everything a second time, discovered a few things I had missed, enjoyed the new app, and the additional references to help us cope with the new normal we are living in. Beyond that, I know that I am already twice a winner. My happiness level has been maintained as I continue to practice and master these skills. I highly recommend this course to each one of you, family, friends, colleagues and connections online and offline!

Ejemplo actos de bondad, en mi caso que pertenezco a una ONG que realizaba colectas de sangre e inscribía donantes en el banco mundial para el trasplante de médula, recientemente fue permitido, siguiendo muchos protocolos. Pero como me hace feliz hacerlo no fue difícil retomar el hábitoMe hizo muy bien continuar con las meditaciones. La actividad física también pude continuarla con bicicleta fija, pero tuve que abandonar yoga. Estaba inscripta para tai chi y aun no comenzaron las clases. Igualmente adquirí gracias al curso necesidad de realizar actividad física.Tengo el tiempo programado para personas conocidas ahora que se puede recibir a los familiares, especialmente a mis nietos a la salida del colegio y también me reúno con amigas. El desafío son las conexiones con extraños que las voy a poder practicar en las colectas.Fue una gran decisión inscribirme en este curso, ha cambiado mi filosofía de vida, dejé de estar siempre ocupada, pendiente de lo que debía hacer después  y llegué a saborear los momentos, no dejé de hacer las cosas, pero es como si el tiempo se hubiera hecho flexible.Permanentemente siento la necesidad de rever los apuntes.Muchas gracias por todo lo recibido

She is passionate about her students and the subject matter. There are many people, like myself, who don't realize that they have yet to find a purpose in life. Combined with using the wrong approach for finding and obtaining happiness in one's life, this course will put you in the right direction by describing and explaining what is truly important to a human being. The course is a lot of fun, and it is meant to be an introduction to a misunderstood subject. You should not expect to put a lot of time into this course because it's not meant to be difficult. You get the real results from this course by applying what you have learnt after you have completed the course. That is where and when you will truly benefit from having taken this course.

You are a remarkably fluent presenter--the words flow from your mouth as the curly locks from your head  :)  I have also appreciated your warm, inviting manner.  In thinking about the course, I have learned the value of sleep, savoring, gratitude, exercise, and kindness, among other aspects of Well-Being.  While one might say, ""Of course, those are the essentials to happiness,"" the strength of the course, for me, lies in these 3 aspects: at heart the secret of happiness and well-being is simple, but it is helpful to be reminded of that; the careful studies which bear out the previous point; and finally the powerful notion that not only do we inculcate gratitude, kindness, and so forth, we can wire it right into our physical selves, the brain and nervous system.Thanks again and good luck with the next 3,000,000 students.

78795510~COURSE!~rUHfSakHEeeQ3gpuC4Fs_g,1618820329895,5,0,"This course exceeded my expectations beyond belief.After losing my younger cousin unexpectedly and then my best friend to suicide, I lost meaning and purpose in my life. As a result, I became treatment resistant to my mental health medications.As if that weren't enough, my new business collapsed due to the unforeseen travesty that is COVID-19. The implausible idea of an actual global pandemic striking during our lifetime had suddenly become very real, very quick.My 2 other independent contract positions that I was working to supplement my main income and hold me afloat as my business grew would shortly follow suit.I began experiencing financial hardship, nearly got evicted from my residence and battled other obstacles...yes, there were others.And this all happened in six months.There were many months of deep hopelessness, helplessness and darkness that I won't get into. But then I came across The Science of Wellbeing.This course reminded me of what it took in the past to want to get out of bed in the morning. It taught me to feel important--not even to others, but to myself. To practice kindness to others, even when the world hasn't been so kind to me. And so, so much more.One of the greatest learning points for me is that we're wrong. We're human and we're so very wrong. Wrong about what we think we want and what we think will make us happy. Our intuitions are often wrong and the science corroborates it! This is something I really needed to see, to read and to become aware of right at this time in my life.I really wasn't sure what to expect with this course or if I'd get anything at all out of it. I was skeptical, but had a little piece of hope because, honestly, nothing else was working for me. And I'm so glad that I did.Since the start of this course and as it progressed, I decided to actively continue working on medication management and have since found a couple that are starting to help immensely.I've rebuilt relationships with important people in my life.I feel valuable most days.I found the motivation to apply for a nationwide scholarship to attend the AAS21 conference hosted by the American Association of Suicidology....and won.I now get to attend in my best friend, Mikey's, honor and use the knowledge I'll gain to help others who are hurting, since Mikey no longer can.Professor Laurie Santos, you've not only made this course one of the most interesting and valuable courses I've ever taken, but created something so brilliant and life-changing. You've turned my life back around. You've ignited the spark in me that I thought went totally out.And I thank you so very much.Thank you, thank you, thank you!Thank you to Yale University, as well!And thank you to Coursera!Take this course everyone!",0,0,Timothy McGullam,78795510

sessions I had many doubts about the true usefulness of what those 10 weeks of
work would be. In general, I consider myself a very committed person with what
I do and when I start something, I usually finish it. But connecting with the
challenge is fundamental and that at first I did not see it so clearly,
however, as the course progressed, the readings and support videos, the tools
seen for rewiring and making a different strategy weekly, they achieved get hooked
and find the meaning of the course. This learning time has been a gift to me,

Not only has it taught me many more detailed and often unexpected and counter-intuitive aspects to Positive Psychology, it has also taught me how many of my old habits and thinking patterns were more self-destructive and unfounded than good and how Fixed my mindset was before this. Through the timely pacing and the warm, welcoming, yet professional academic environment of Ms. Laurie, one really gets to dive into and benefit from the findings and wisdoms of research-based Positive Psychology, but also challenges how to apply them into your own life (through WOOP strategies) and realise that the G.I.

Ms. Laurie teaches us to question and bring us back to the basics of what is best for our Mental, Social, Physical, Psychological and Emotional wellbeing in the long run and how to realise how to truly come into our own and put our wellbeing and happiness first for ourselves and for the natural positive trickle down effect in our environment too! Couldn't recommend this course, especially for Coursera and Academic students and people of ALL walks of life, enough! Thank you Ms. Laurie and will continue to be curious and put my best foot forward for my own Health, Wellbeing and Happiness!",0,0,Noa McDonald,75818672

In the process, I tumbled across this Program. That too from Yale! And Free! A God-send, I feel.This program is an integration of different developments in Psychology at different points of time by different researchers and moulded into one of Well Being,  for all the people. It gives the Modus Operandi to become Happier, much more than Wishing A Happy New Year or A Happy Married Life which are well meaning rituals.There is a lot to learn from this program and lucky are those who learn them at a younger age.  They can consciously lead a happy life. I am trying to spread the benefits  of this program in my circle through Facebook, WhatsApp and email through a summary (article) I have made.And, everybody in this world is craving for happiness : if only they know of this program, they will be better off.",0,4,Jagannathan A.K,35418765

I got so much more from this course then that.  I have learned to take time for myself, to be appreciative for all the things that surround my world.  But the importance of savoring and gratitude were really eye opening.  Savoring being only when you are present.  I realized how much time in my day I was not in the present!!  I now make that a challenge.  My rewirement is exercise and that is now a routine in my day.  The first week I was not dedicated, but the second week I felt I had let myself down.  Not a good feeling so I decided to change that.  Never want to be a disappointment to myself again!!  Thank you for this course, I think about what I learned daily and my life is much better for it.

motivation during the course has been getting some feeling of studying in a
Yale class. This corresponds pretty good with Dr. Laurie Santos aim of her
Welcome Letter: “To make the lectures feel more intimate, we filmed at my home in one of
Yale’s residential colleges with a small group of Yale students in the audience
… We understand that many of you taking the course are not
currently college students, but we hope you see yourselves as though you are
part of this virtual classroom.”Despite the fact
that I´m about 50 years old I have the unexplainable cheesy wish to study at
Yale University. I would like to be merged in the on-campus life with all experiences
at least for a short term. Living in a residential college with a roommate and
having access to all facilities like the gym and libraries. For those who want
to get a feeling for what dream I have there are two awesome image films
available at YouTube which give a great impression (“That´s Why I Chose Yale” and
“That´s Why I Toured Yale”).Taking this
daydream into account it is easy understandable that I enjoyed all the video
lectures that were produced in the awesome surrounding of the Master´s House of
Sillimann College. It is some kind of wellness for the eyes seeing Laurie
Santos sitting in this beautiful flower pattern wing chair. This set of optical
attraction prepared my mind for sucking in the content of all lectures. For me
as it is probably for many others too not only the contend counts it is also
important how the content is provided like good arranged food in a nice ambient
versus eating the same food in a takeaway box while riding the overcrowded NYC Subway.Another reason
why I have enjoyed the course during the last 10 weeks is that I have deeply
savored practicing all study work in English. Reading, listening and writing as
I do right now. It is a fantastic and satisfying activity for me as none native
speaker experiencing the capability of being able to fully participate in an
English class at Yale. Here it is the same as it is described with the
beautiful environment above. I am not that focused on the aim reaching more
well-being at the end of the course for me there has already been well-being conducting
the course. I have been challenged and in flow.Along with the
above mentioned it is obviously that the content of the course has connected me
with my real wishes and values which is a good start to continue a long lasing
journey. I couldn´t have
made a better choice than taking “The Science of Well-Being”. A big thank you
to Dr. Laurie Santos and all of the crew which created and produced this awesome
online course, well done!",0,0,Markus Lehnert,65354302

I started doing the exercises from the first week of classes (combining theory and practice at once). And literally from the first week I realized that it really works.Honestly, I used to think that happiness is when you have a lot of money, a stable job, a husband. How wrong I was!After taking the course, I realized that happiness really lies in simple things: the ability to be grateful (to life, people, yourself), to be able to live the moment and enjoy it, to have good health (and this requires at least minimal physical activity and normal sleep )! Having received such a wonderful result after the course, I am not going to stop there and continue to work on what to be happy! I wish everyone to find their well-being!",0,0,Diachok Nadia,68067843

How different my life would have been but, of course, many of its insights are only recent psychological discoveries so perhaps my wish is futile.  I have benefited enormously from the insight that well-being is an emotional state that depends on one's outlook and one's outlook can be improved by simple things such as getting sufficient rest and exercise and practising daily meditation along with remembering always to give thanks for the blessings life gives us and to spread the warmth of our well-being through acts of kindness.  I've also learned how easy and misguided it is to focus on possessions at the cost of experiencing life's simple pleasures and how easily one can miswant things in one's life that lead only to disappointment.  Negative visualizing has also helped me to truly appreciate the abundant and extraordinary life that I enjoy.  It doesn't surprise me that this excellent course has attracted millions of participants.  Well done to Professor Laurie Santos who is so special and to whom I owe such an enormous debt of gratitude.

so much value to material things when they should not have it. It also allowed

satisfactory and that are almost always the ones we already have and that do
not cost us anything financially speaking. I am very grateful to God and to

I felt the course went into a lull when the lecture stopped. I get it that we need to be on our own to experience and do stuff, but more reflection on how people went would be good - give a sense that everyone finds this hard and there are ways to keep at it.

appropriate for part time learners.  I

had the discipline of setting aside the time to take the online pieces together
in one sitting, which I think was important for me.The scientific researched based knowledge
was very well explained.  For those who
are not in a formal college setting much academic research can be daunting but
here is was presented in context with good visuals and excellent relevancy.  Thank you Professor Santos for making it so

51344872~COURSE!~rUHfSakHEeeQ3gpuC4Fs_g,1592422244521,5,0,"For a long time, I have been struggling in the whirlpool of negative thoughts. It is basically a negative idea when I encounter something uncomfortable,  so that I am very afraid of being leisure, I feel that life has been pushed forward, rarely feeling in control of life. Maybe I am too sensitive? I feel that I must hold the railing when I walk down the stairs, worrying that I might step on the ground and fall.Over the years, I have tried various methods to ease negative thinking, which is somewhat effective, but it is good and bad. Now I can only be at home due to COIVD-19, maybe this is God's Intervention, then I can have more time to face the depths of my soul. I just saw this course on the website after spending a few days in isolation at home. Experience of years have enabled me to understand that practice and action are far more important than knowing the theory, despite facing inertia and laziness from time to time.Looking at my own records of rewirement for around two months, Basically, all rewirements--savoring, dailygratitude journal, random acts of kindness, social connection, exercise, sleep, meditation, and gratitude letter/visit--  have continued to do now. I found that the best performing is savoring, the worst is random acts of kindness. What has formed a habit is exercise.What needs to be improved is social connection and daily gratitude.There was no clear execution plan at the beginning. It was not until two weeks ago that I saw the theory of individual development plan(IDP) which I realized that I still continued the arbitrariness of the past. Fortunately, I have a habit of recording slowly. At the same time, recording will also promote my own reflection and progress, so I stumbled on and persevered. Generally, every Monday, there is a goal to be achieved in a week and the corresponding plan. I will look at the records to detect the deficiencies in the process. This somehow makes up for my shortcomings of arbitrariness and inertia.Through the record, I realized that if the plan was completed and it was  calculated by ten points, I probably reached about seven points. Fortunately, when I am at home, I have enough time. If I have been busy in the past, I’m afraid my best is half of it. Comparing the scores of the questionnaire at the beginning and the present, and the slowly-perceived changes in mood in daily life, this course brings many good effects, specially savoring pleasures at present moment, doing meditation often. I have less anxiety. To quote the following, encourage those who are interested in Well-Being to move forward together.Savor pleasures and live in the present momentMake physical activity a habitAre deeply committed to meaningful goalsAre often the first to help othersNurture and enjoy social relationshipsAre comfortable expressing gratitudePractice optimism about futureWe can take deliberate control of how we act and think through intentional activity.From: Lyubomirsky(2001); Diener et al.(1999); Myers(2000), Diener & Lucas(1999); Argyle(1999).",0,0,Jane Gao,51344872

I gained so many insights into myself as well as others, but the increased awareness of who I am and my relationships to others was dramatic. I found a level of internal calmness develop that carried into my daily life. When I read that a wandering mind was an unhappy mind, I thought not my wandering mind. Then it sank into my being that indeed my wandering mind was unhappy. This led me to chose meditation as my project. As I submitted my final paper I felt comfortable to title it, “My wandering Mind has Unpacked her Suitcase.” Although I’ve only been doing this for 43 days, it has become a part of my day; rising at 6:30 to meditate for 10 mins to begin my day with this practice. This is still a ""practice"" but one I will take with me throughout my life. It has shown me a way to keep my mind focused and it bags unpacked. .Thank you!M. Patricia O'Connell",0,0,Mary P.

As a gratitude exercise I'd like also to share with you a personal achievement throughout this course. My wife has been diagnosticated as a depressive patient since last year. So, when I had the opportunity to know about the science of well-being, I've thought: ""yes, I can try to help my wife sharing and discussing with her these concepts and techniques"". And few weeks later er're harvesting the fruits. The average of my wife's well-being improvement was close to 46%, and right now she's getting better and better. My family, including my daughter and son, have been doing dialy pointing about their level of well-being in a tool that I've built during the course. I've called this tool Well-being Daily Monitoring.
Again, thank you so much professor Laurie Santos and The Science of Well-being team for this ""gift"" for all of us.

was backed up by research but offered in a comfortable and easy to understand

automatically guarantee that it would change behaviour. I also realized that I
was guilty of allowing several annoying features to cloud my own sense of
reality, and how blessed I am. It was an eye-opener to realise that some of my
reference points were off, and I needed to reset those, which made a massive
difference to my personal perspective. I have a real sense that I have changed
over this course. We, as a country, have been in lockdown, and I have lost all
income, because of my inability to work, BUT I had a real sense of being
mindful of what I did have, and what I could control. I have spent lockdown
with my family, and that has been a special gift. For someone who travels a lot
generally, this has been a special joy to have daily tea dates with my parents,
spend time with my adult children and have daily play dates with my brand-new

55351945~COURSE!~rUHfSakHEeeQ3gpuC4Fs_g,1590220107398,5,0,"Hi Laura!Am Suryakumari, halfway through the Course, The Science of Well Being, that you are handling so well. Being a fellow Prof, I can gauge each and every aspect that has been painstakingly included to make the Course heavy on content and yet seemingly light. Your presentation with the accompanying smile in the videos is the charmer! Keep Smiling!!I would like to share the way am doing the Rewirements. Presently am on Week 3. Am a 55 year old, a Life Skills Coach in addition to being an Economics Prof. These rewirements are an everyday process, not bragging..hope you can understand what am saying.. given my profession and age:)My only problem, I am unable to categorize and do only one act of rewiring week-wise as prescribed.In order to keep track and make note, I created an excel with categories (as Kindness, Savoring, Gratitude and Social Connection) and dates. Am describing the act in the table and made an extra column called 'Happiness Meter' and giving it a scale of 1-5. Lockdown started for me from Mar 15th, hence I made another sheet for that month calling it 'Lockdown Rewirements' although I started this Course only from Apr 12th. Unable to attach the template here..can mail it if you let me know how. I have shared it in the Discussion Forum for others to use, if they like it.All I need is to make a journal entry and categorize. I found this more interesting than marking circles on the given worksheet. Am sure this will be fun to maintain after the course completion, and will serve as a wake up call to be good, do good and feel good all through, not just during the Course. It will be nice to read this later as my Rewirements Diary!!With nudges provided in the lectures, started a 'Recollections Project' with my 84 year old mom, who is a cancer survivor and has restricted mobility at home due to osteoarthritis. She's regaling us with childhood stories of her 13 siblings!!! Phase 2 will be us, her children:)Thank you for the great Course you are conducting. All the Best. Stay safe, be Happy!!The above was written much earlier. Now I have completed the Course. I did extremely great on bringing down Loneliness factor pre to post course scores. That shows how connected I felt with everyone ib the Course. Gonna miss this! This was my stress buster, really.P.S: It would be a full circle if you can include the role of relationships in well being. Irrespective of the n number of rewirements one does, if there is the presence of a bully, dominant or abusive person in one's life, be it a parent, sibling, partner or colleague/boss at work, it affects well being and self esteem very badly. Moving out of the relationship may not always be possible. Hope you consider this aspect. Thank you. ",0,0,Dr Suryakumari,55351945

activities are very effective, they are for free and can be done in all kind of

Rewirement, as it can be done during traveling or if someone is sick. Lot of

Three weeks later, I got fired from my Executive-level job. Two weeks after that, I was home-bound by the pandemic. I was having panic attacks pretty much 24/7.I started the class with little hope--not that I had hope in anything. But, I have a Master of Arts degree in Counseling Psychology, so obviously I believe in mental health. The change wasn't immediate, but once I started the rewirement process, it all took hold. I read three of the books that were referenced in the course-FLOW, Stumbling upon Happiness, and Mindset. These also helped solidify the information in my mind.Thank you.

The Science of Well-Being is for anyone, whether you are passionate about psychology or a very different field. This course shares insightful information about happiness through looking at psychological studies and ideas, but more importantly, it informs us of how we, ourselves, can be happier. The use of weekly tasks helps with this. Although not graded, the activities, in my opinion, help us develop ""intrinsic motivation"", which is a term that is discussed in the course. In other words, this course may not guarantee someone to become happier but certainly provides them will the tools needed to do so.In addition to the material, the professor is lovely. Her examples make the information comprehensible and her touch of humour ensures that you are engaged.
