The instructor constantly makes students copy what he's doing, without explaining the code he's using or syntax.  The peer review assignments are guided to the point of absurdity, so you're not actually learning but instead parroting what he's doing, hoping that someday you will understand intuitively what you've just done.  Further, he's constantly hemming and hawing, making typos, and generally being distracting with his lack of presentational confidence, so that you can't focus on the material.  The hemming and hawing I could deal with, if only the content were well thought-out and facilitated the learning process; sadly, this is not the case.  For the first app wherein we do anything useful, we have to use someone else's previously written object, CurrencyRequest, without any explanation of how it works or the syntax required to invoke it.  We have to change permissions in some file--again with no explanation as to what we're actually doing--then assign variables with--big surprise!  new syntax which is not explained!Extremely disappointed, wish I could get my money back.

There's a bit of a tour of XCode, but it's not particularly comprehensive. The apps you build are incredibly basic, and there's no real discussion of how to generalize from them.3) Is the course presented in an engaging way? 1/5This course is super boring. If you already know C, a lot of the content is a waste of time, but I imagine that if you don't know C this is not a good way to pick it up.So overall 2/5One other thing - the assignments are graded in a pretty bizarre way. You have to take a screencap video of your code and your app in action, upload the video, and then wait for another person to enroll in the course and review your submission. In return, you have to review three other people's videos. Sort of a rolling homework Ponzi scheme. This strikes me as a system that could be greatly improved upon!",0,0,David Frenk,18489977
