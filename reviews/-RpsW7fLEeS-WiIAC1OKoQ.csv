33041172~COURSE!~-RpsW7fLEeS-WiIAC1OKoQ,1525342795772,3,0,"While the course readings were informational, I found the overall experience in Coursera to be unengaging. The following are specific challenges I felt diminished my experience.         The Forum and peer-review assignments are identical. This leads to some students reposting the same information for both and limits the value-add of the exercises. Course leaders should add different prompts to encourage other types of engagement. ·        When student enrollment is low, the engagement is very limited. There is almost no discussion and your assignments are not graded by many people or within the time frame. When you go to enroll, it would be helpful to see how many other students are enrolled. ·        The professors do not engage during the course. They do not respond on the forum or the assignments. They essentially do not exist. ·        The estimated time for the additional readings is way off the mark. This activity should be given more accurate time estimates.

82867777~COURSE!~-RpsW7fLEeS-WiIAC1OKoQ,1657580073505,4,0,"Very informative course. I did learn a great deal of litracy pedagogies that I myself didn't knew about until this course. The videos are informative and the discussions do reinforce your critical thinking. Only con is that some of the concepts in the videos are outdated in today's education standards. Other than that, useful information on literacy pedagogies.",0,0,Miguel Guillermez,82867777
70000188~COURSE!~-RpsW7fLEeS-WiIAC1OKoQ,1621142241113,4,0,"The course offers helpful guidance through key modes and models of contemporary literacy pedagogy. The material for further reading is inspiring and carefully chosen. The lecture videos are easy to follow; the emphasis is on the spoken word of two leading and passionate experts, not on fancy visualisations (I actually found some of the slides with key terms that appeared in the background a bit distracting). I have learned a lot and made intetesting discoveries.Some minor quibbles:(1) The format of the course allows anyone to start learning at any time. This has the disadvantage that you might be studying during a time with a very small cohort of fellow students and therefore far fewer of the vivid peer discussions you might know from more synchronized MOOCs.(2) While their topics vary, all four obligatory writing assignments basically require you to write in the same genre, a little scholarly essay with bibliographical references. It would have been nice to be allowed one assignment in a different format, e.g. in the shape of a drawing or a more creative text.",0,3,Cornelia Rémi,70000188
