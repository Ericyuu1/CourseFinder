10058175~COURSE!~H3nu58bgEeqGYxIaWE5-Rw,1623508765932,2,0,"Positive:
- Screen Sharing
- Friendly instructor

Negative: 
- To many ""ahms""- Instructure did not properly prepare the script for the course.
- No real ""brain"" work involved: you just copy an image of an existing persona and use an existing miro template. Then he spends more then 10-15 min explaning on how to use emojis and copy/paste stuff around.
- No Background information on ""why"" this or that pain point in the journe is relevant. 
- No intro in to customer journey mapping: why / how / what. . . 

Verdict: 
Maybe for someone not comfortable using Online Tools such as Miro.",0,2,Mika,10058175
