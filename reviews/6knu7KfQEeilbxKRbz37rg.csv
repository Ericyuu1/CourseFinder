In general I also found myself wasting a lot of time trying to understand the definition of columns of NHANES or other datasheets which I think is useless. In overall I found that the assessments do not evaluate the progress of the student.*The assessments sometimes are not related to the concepts explained during the week (Name that scenario) or in the case of Pythos quiz ask for unexplained functions (week 3).*Some assignements, like the Chocoloate assignement, are about previously not explained concepts (cross-over test desing). *The Jupyter Notebook have several errors, reported in the discussion forums but not solved. Moreover, some parts of the code shown are not explained. And finally, the way to solve a problem is different in the explanation video and notebook; this is very confusing for the student.*Week 3 explains several times the same concept (CI and p_value) but them skip to explain the Power or SampleSize in detail, which are just mentioned in a Jupyter Python notebook. Moreover, I found missing a detailed explained on when to use z_test or t_test; I would had dedicate some time to this explanations, and less to repeat the same CI and p_value examples over and over. *Week 4, is just a review of week 3.

5. Difference in means for independent observations/groups

The course covered lecture videos, well-prepared readings, Jupyter notebooks to introduce concepts as well as practice notebooks, lab walkthroughs, written assignment and quizzes. Brady may speak alittle too fast, especially when it comes to long sentences, so you may need to rewind certain segments of the videos numerous times to revisit some concepts as you reflect and learn.

Through the Jupyter notebooks, you will better understand challenges when working with datasets and the nuances of how to perform these hypothesis tests in real life, compared to ""sampling design and hypothesis testing"" on paper (back in school in the past).

The discussions forums was also actively monitored by a TA who got back to me usually within a day, which helped to unblock conceptual roadblocks quickly.

You may encounter some issues with the Coursera platform:
1. Labs may fail to load at times, even after following instructions to restart the machine which your lab runs from
2. Your discussion forum comments may disappear right after you post. Remember to  copy your comment somewhere else (e.g. on a notepad) as you may need to refresh the page and post your comment again.

I for one, wish i watched week 4 first.Why i say that ... because the examples were all over the place... at some point i wasn't sure if i was supposed to use a t-test or a z-test. Some examples were repeating themselves throughout the course. Sometimes the code presented in the video was not the same as the one present in the lab files.
