My overall course completion is 99%, but I can't go back and start the lab on week 1 exercise as it said I've used all my 180 minutes.  Can someone please help? I've put lots of time and effort into this course.   ",0,1,Levin Y,109082616

Finally, it seems that no one is really taking care of the questions from students on the forum. So I would not recommend it.",0,1,Rocco Incardona,9210173

If AWS and NVIDIA try to use this course as a branding opportunity for SageMaker with GPUs, asking potential clients to debug for free is obviously not a good idea.",0,1,Chih-Wei Chen,544896
