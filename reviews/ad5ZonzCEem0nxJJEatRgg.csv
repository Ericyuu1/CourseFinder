I expected more details about sampling methodology, but the background and history  why health equity has been challenging is critical for creating the contextual conditions for change.   The lecturers were good.  Maybe there could have been less emphasis on hiring staff.  It is iportant, but I think other areas could have been focused on a little more.

While some of the concepts are definitely not unheard of, the way they integrate well to the overarching goal of promoting health equity is quite new to me. I was also able to acknowledge better the challenges, in terms of research infrastructure and health disparities, in my local context. While all five modules are interesting and well-made, my favorite take-aways from this offering are those involving research and interventions related to health literacy. For people from developing nations who are interested to conduct endeavors on health equity promotion in their own setting, I think that this material can serve as a model to realize such goals.",0,1,Aedrian Abrilla,41195652
