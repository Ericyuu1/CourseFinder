The professor takes extreme care in explaining the data and their limitations .

The course is always very useful in understanding the origins and effects of aid, FDI, trade , and finance. From a  certain viewpoint it is disappointing to learn that institutions like the World Bank and the IMF have not really delivered on the great expectations that they probably created when they were set up.
