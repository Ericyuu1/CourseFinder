In other classes, you can only download a computer transcription of the lecture, with no corrections or alterations made to it by the instructor. It certainly cannot stand on it's own as a learning tool. Also, you take the quizzes, you submit your answers, and it tells you which answers are right or wrong. In this class you can download the slides she uses, and after you get the quiz 100% correct you can download the answer sheet (in case you just guessed at an answer and see how it was supposed to have been done).But it's not perfect. Some slides are missing from the downloads. And in the week 5 lectures the downloaded additional notes have the equations used but are all missing the =, +, and - symbols, which makes using them for reference a pain.Another annoying thing is that if you don't score well enough on an exam (like I didn't because I used the wrong equation for the area of a circle) you have to wait 24 hours to take it again. And there is no real time clock - when you come back the next day it still says you have to wait 24 hours and not the actual hour or two. This should be changed.And don't bother to leave a question on the material or an exam - there is no one to answer your note. You're on your own kid.And this is only Part 1. A Part 2 and 3 was promised 6 years ago but has so far not shown up. I did learn some things from this class even though I'm an engineer with 20 years of experience and took it as a refresher class.
