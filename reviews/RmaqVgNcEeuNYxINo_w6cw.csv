Not for newbs you should have some experience with python and plotly for latter check out official documentation. This project is for those who are having trouble with dash, it does not teach you plotting in detail and neither working with pandas. The Dash HTML Component is explained in good detail but Dash Core Components were somewhat not adequately explained, nevertheless you get to create radio buttons, different plots and create a selection box. The creator has said he is ready to help you should you contact him. ",0,2,Sumit Kumar Singh,56797350
