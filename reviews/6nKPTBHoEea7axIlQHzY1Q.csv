I had to research the subjects on another websites as I honestly did not see half of them on the videos. All other tests were more reliable to what was previously learned.

Up to this point, I did download the file. Overall I do not recommend this course to anyone. Reasons are clear: the ""sluggishness"" of the videos and presenter and the final/ultimate 4GB gift.
