There are minor things like I disliked like a few of the problems being worded unclearly and some lectures topics that weren't explained in the best manner. But for the majority of the course content the delivery was excellent.The course teaches programming languages in the functional paradigm using SML. The material is at a level you'd find in third year at a top-tier university computer science program, so in that way it is a bargain, but it also means you will need to invest serious time in order to complete it. You will likely need the full month and 8-16 weekly hours as advertised, this isn't one of those MOOCs where you finish a week's module in a day (especially if you've never done functional programming before).In terms of difficult, I'd rate it at about the level of the common algorithms MOOCS (maybe a bit lower?). It's doable, but it takes time, so don't be intimidated. Before commencing I highly recommend you can program in one of Java/C#/C++/C  (JS/Python alone are not enough imo) and understand basics of data structures up to using recursion on binary trees (no need for graphs and beyond). You'll also need some basic command line knowledge like compiling from a terminal or running VIM from it. If you have that down, I highly recommend enrolling.

I had excused myself with (false) statements such as ""this course is too theoretical to be immediately useful"" and ""what's the point of spending time scratching the surface of a not-so-popular language"". Looking back, I couldn't believe how wrong i was at the time, and couldn't be more glad that I finally started to pull through this series.Sure this series is more theoretical and has little of the ""cool"" projects, but even this first course of the series has already shed new lights on my perspectives on programming languages, familiar or new. I used to see programming languages each in a class of their own (or only with similarities on the syntax-level), but this course has so far taught me, that there are governing principles true to all programming languages, and general rules that apply to types/families of languages. Granted that I was writing ML the whole time for this course, but throughout the assignments and lectures, I couldn't help (though really not supposed to) but kept on seeing connections to languages that I'm familiar with (Options -> Java Optional, Signature -> header files, map/filter/reduce across the board). It was quite some exciting moments of (re)discovery, finding out about ideas that translate from one language to another.I highly recommend this course to anyone who aspire to become better programmers.
