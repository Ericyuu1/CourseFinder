48541660~COURSE!~ep-4ulLrEeiBPApDh8r5mg,1581924657801,2,0,"The transcripts for the videos are clearly not reviewed and include word substitution errors that could possibly be made by software or by someone who has English as a second language and erroneously selected a similar-sounding word. In some cases, you can figure out what is trying to be conveyed, but in other cases it's pretty confusing. Some of the additional resources are just advertisements from companies trying to sell their robots. Some of the additional resources links don't work. Some of the questions in the quizzes make no sense, partly because of incorrect word substitutions. Other issues include a yes/no question in week 4 where the ""yes"" answer and the ""no"" answer each provided an explanation after either the yes or the no... but the yes and the no were attached to the wrong explanations, thus causing the answers to be illogical and false. Another question asks about an arm being pinned by a robot, but the answer it wants is the answer for the user's palm being pinned. The palm is mentioned in the question, but the arm is the part the question says is pinned- so the answer the test wants is not the answer the question asks. The video in week 4 is terrible, and doesn't really effectively answer the question associated with it. ",0,0,Jessica Niles,48541660

Mr Carlisle and Mr Garman share their invaluable expertise. I feel more confident now about designing collaborative robot applications and performing the risk assessment. This course can profit from a better lesson structure. At some points it jumps from one topic to another without a good connection. All formulas and diagrams should be presented in the videos. For example, the forward reflected inertia is a complex concept indeed, and only few of the students would go figure out the formula by themselves and fully understand it. The same goes for accident causes classification - the diagram must be in the discussion video, not in the end of the course.The young lecturer (who did not introduce himself) has out-of-place intonations and hand gestures that are extremely distracting.
