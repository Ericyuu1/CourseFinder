I could go through it a couple more times and still pick up new stuff.That being said, I've heard him mention he did these videos at like 1 or 2 in the morning after work, and it's very obvious from the videos. He makes so many mistakes that every other lecture (it seems like) has a **CORRECTION** notification next to it. I mean it's great they give this additional correction information, but it would be even better if you just redid the video.Furthermore, he like stops in the middle of the videos and then repeats the last sentence he said, because he made another mistake. I get it, Andrew is very successful, he's very busy, and I am definitely grateful for the knowledge he's provided in this course. But this makes for a very poor learning experience, because I'm taking notes, and I have to go back and redo them, plus the general angst you get when you're learning something and someone's like ""oh wait nope that's not right, forget that."" Well for God's sake I already learned it.Finally, the submission assignments are the most annoying things I have ever come across. They are riddled with errors and misguided information where they literally tell you to use the wrong parameters, and then they never fix it. You have to go into the discussions to find out why your code is wrong, even though you're doing it right.Then, you'll get everything right on your code for the test cases, and when you go to submit it fails you. And when I say it fails you, it gives you a literally 0 out of like 30 points. And the grader output just says ""your submission was incorrect"" like no way, I had no idea. Thank you for that very **cough** helpful piece of info.If you go to the discussions, you find out this is actually a problem with how the grader is built, because if you don't format your code exactly the right way, it fails you, even if your solution is correct. I don't understand why it can be right when you run test cases, but submitting it fails.Overall, I give it 3 stars before the poor grading, but because of the poor grading performance I have to bring it down to 2. I can't tell you how much time I wasted trying to figure out why my code was wrong just to realize it was right, but they screwed up their implementation.In conclusion, this reminded me of a college course, where the professor has a ton of knowledge and is in high demand, and doesn't really care whether you get anything out of the course or not. It's sloppy, doesn't seem to be maintained very well, and most of the mentor's responses are literally ""did you look at your colleagues similar questions?"" Like no I didn't, that's why I'm asking. Why am I paying you so I can spend more time debugging your screw ups? Or maybe I did and I still don't get it because your explanations are ridiculously unclear.I have one more course in this specialization and I absolutely can't wait for it to get over with so i can move on to more productive (and immersive, since these exercises are just one off ""do this then do that"" instructions, I still don't know how to set up a Deep Learning project from scratch) ways to learn Deep Learning.

The experience was quite frustrating, and lost the motivation that I had been carrying through the previous 3 courses.I appreciate Andrew's efforts in delivering the lectures with the aim to present most complex materials as intuitively as possible, but still I feel, because of the complexity involved with CNNs, the material need more explanations, and maybe extending the course duration to 6 weeks will provide more opportunity to the instructors to present the matter more clearly.Quite remarkably, the programming exercises fell short on my expectation. It was not useful more than just a simple syntax-check exercise for TensorFlow/Keras/Python. It gives a false sense of achievement, when, in fact, I feel myself far from learning the theoretical underpinnings of the various algorithms explained throughout the course.To conclude, by completing the course, I believe that you surely would get to know the vocabulary used in CNNs and would be aware of the algorithms developed in the domain, but you won't learn enough to implement these algorithms from scratch yourself.",0,6,Md.

Unfortunately, as a common problem for all ""Deep Learning Specialization"", theoretical material only scratches the surface of the knowledge. There is nothing deep in terms of theory. You will have to spend quite a lot of time digging for information yourself if you plan to use course material for any practical task, or assignment.

I am puzzled what these quizzes are testing. Provided answers often assume tentatively more than one correct variant. Probability theory works against you - you may happen to select correct answers for some questions , but definitely, not all of them. In the same time, it is quite easy to derive correct variant from second try.Course programming assignments are complete disaster.

More often than not, you find yourself doing guesswork in the assignments when it comes to TF code, which is also reflected in the Discussion Forum. So to summarize, TF must be covered in a systematic way, either in this course, or a previous one. 2)  There is a bug on week 4 NST assignment, on the given code. Should be fixed.3)  There are several written correction to errors in OnLine videos. These Videos can and should be  rerecorded. 4) Last but certainly not least:  I have experienced frequent and really disturbing connection problems with the Python Notebook, with frequent connection errors, which can not be recovered and wherein one must open again the Notebook. While this was, to some extent, the case in other courses, in this course it was much more of a problem, especially in Week 4, probably due to a large amount of data, and where each rerun requires another  20 - 30 minutes. a MUST fix.

Many topics are explained clearly, with valuable field practitioners insight, and you are given quizzes and code-exercises that help deepen the understanding of how to implement the concepts in the videos. I would recommend to take them after the initial Andrew Ng ML course by Stanford, unless you have prior background in this topic.There are a few shortbacks:1 - the video editing is poor and sloppy. Its not too bad, but it’s sometimes can be a bit annoying.2 - most of the exercises are too easy, and are almost copy-paste. I need to go over them and create variations of them in-order to strengthen my practical skills. Some exercises are quite challenging though (especially in course 4 and 5), and I need to go over them just to really nail them down, as things scale up quickly. Course 3 has no exercises as its more theoretical. Some exercises have bugs - so make sure to look at the discussion board for tips (the final exercise has a huge bug that was super annoying).3 - there are no summary readings - you have to (re)watch the videos in order to check something, which is annoying. This is partially solved because the exercises themselves usually hold a lot of (textual) summary, with equations.4 - the 3rd course was a bit less interesting in my opinion, but I did learn some stuff from it. So in the end it’s worth it. 5 - Slide graphics and Andrew handwriting could be improved. 6 - the online Coursera Jupyter notebook environment was a bit slow, and sometimes get stuck.

The reasons why 4 stars and not 5:Course material sometimes not as rigorous as one would expect: formulas for the same thing changing from one slide to the next (with the second slide not being correct), missing or erroneous indices like summation indices,... This is a bit unfortunate, as the course material is the one thing one would expect to be 100% accurate.Quiz questions sometimes ambiguous when not outright confusing, making you wonder what the quiz author is really after. In some instances (luckily not too many), getting the right answer is as much about second-guessing what the quiz author intent is as it is about checking you have understood the course contents correctly. Sometimes you guess right, sometimes you don't! On average, there is one quiz question per quiz where this is the case, so, you end up submitting twice: the first time with the answer to the question that you think the quiz author meant, and the second time with the answer that the quiz author expects, given what he really meant.Mentor support: this remark is not specific to this particular course, it is more of a general issue with Coursera courses. The Mentor system where mentors are supposed to help you out, while a great idea, just does not work as well as most learners can expect.

You truly do learn a lot from what he teaches!Sadly I have to downrate this particular class due to huge technical problems with submitting Jupyter notebook based assignments.  In particular, week 4's face recognition assignment was marred by several issues.  For one thing, the grader would often crash and report technical issues instead of grading the assignment.  For another thing, the grader would also take 30 to 60 minutes to run, which is far longer than it takes to actually run the Jupyter notebook itself!  Finally, and quite seriously, in order to get 30/30 on the face recognition assignment of week 4, I had to submit an INCORRECT answer due to a bug in the grader itself.  At least for me these are primarily week 4 issues.This class is still a terrific value and a valuable course for anyone wishing to study deep learning, and I am planning to make good use of these lessons.  But I do believe that especially for the face recognition assignment it would have behooved the developers to test the assignment thoroughly before making it available to students and also to correct the substantial quality problems (i.e. failing a correct answer and accepting a wrong answer along with grader crashes) involving the grader.  I hope these programming assignment quality problems do not appear again in the fifth course on recurrent networks because I am very much looking forward to that particular course given some of the projects I work on!I was torn on whether to give this three stars only or four stars but decided that given the overall learning value I am still giving it four stars.  But again I do hope the developers are reading these reviews and also the discussion forums regarding the major quality issues involving the face recognition programming assignment.  The other assignments were very good and did not pose such ridiculous issues (my experience only.)",0,0,Ryan M,16546517

So, let me share feedback about current situation and my feelings about specialization here. Right now 4 courses released and they are all quite different if you will compare amount of practical exercises. This exercises are most important, but some of ""weeks' doesn't have programming assignments at all. There is no homework here, and such weeks are quite boring. Python notebooks executed on very weak virtual machines and estimated execution time mentioned in notebooks seems VERY optimistic. You cannot debug tasks properly, and you couldn't play with models. And from other side you are not providing convenient way to just download task and run on my own server. Yes, you can say that a lot libraries required to run assignment's. But c'mon if you aimed  on future machine learning engineers, please give them a chance to setup software that they will use every day. Another problem in very big amount of misprints in formulas in notebooks, which makes tasks more difficult in unnecessary places. Quiz questions also a very general, most of them doesn't require any thinking, just good memory. Still, I think this is a one of the best specializations.

66091615~COURSE!~kWGvJivBEeeW5RJUyz1uFA,1628470485364,5,0,"This course is an excellent introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks (aka CNNS, aka ConvNets). The instructor makes the material understandable while not straying away from going into the mathematics behind CNNs. This course also starts to get into some of the really cool applications of AI/ML/DL (such as facial recognition and neural style transfer). I also enjoy how this course (and the rest of the courses in the specialization) keeps a great balance between theory and application. It covers enough of the application (techniques and programming) that you could reasonably start working on a computer vision project straight out of the course, however, it still covers much of the theoretical and in-depth knowledge that you may need to know. The main problem I have with other CS MOOCs is that I sometimes feel that they either only focus on the theory or they only focus on the application (programming and engineering). In the former, you understand many of the in-depth concepts but still need to do a decent amount of learning on your own before you can start making stuff, and with the ladder, while you may have the programming knowledge to know how to program an application, you don't really understand the concepts so you have trouble solving a wide range of problems. For the most part, this course and this specialization straddle the line pretty well. It mainly focuses on the concepts but gives you enough practice that you could start on an application.

One feedback I would have is: many of the lecture assignments contain ""mundane"" in-between tasks, like normalization by 255.0, accessing outputs of certain layers, plotting code, etc. The code snippets for these are already provided and we don't have to implement anything. But I think it is valuable to learn how to write this ""glue code"". I think it might be useful for a future iteration of the course to have an assignment dedicated to having students code up just these ""glue code"" pieces.

Takes me back to a number of problems I worked on in my days in ""image understanding"" / computer vision. Really interesting to see how a deep learning approach contrasts with some of the early attempts at explicit image feature extraction and symbolic reasoning that we were doing back then. And yet, many of the same core concepts are woven throughout the deep learning approach -- image convolution, edge detection and segmentation, ""area of interest"" (AOI) operators multi-resolution feature spaces, ... - all of these are still embedded - now implicitly - in the layers of the networks. And I plan to do a bit more experimentation with ""Neural Style Transfer"" to satisfy my creative side.  THANKS!",0,0,Bruce Moxon,6125164

Some small complaints / recommendations: - Courses don't teach enough Keras & Tensorflow syntax to be completely stand-alone.  If you take this course, you won't really be able to build your own DNN's unless you also take a separate Keras / Tensorflow course.- Links to Keras documentation are broken -- they now take you to the general Keras homepage, not the specific command's page.- In later courses, Andrew Ng's lectures are not edited.  Starting around the 4th course, you start hearing Dr. Ng stop and repeat portions of the lecture, presumably intending the first attempt to be edited out in the future.  Usually this is easy to ignore, but in some cases he repeats 30-60 seconds of lecture, which can be confusing.- In the last course (sequence models), the text captions of Dr. Ng's lecture have a lot of mistakes, which is a little ironic for a course on speech-to-text ",0,0,Sean O'Connor,12994457

Andrew Ng explains it the most thorough, easiest, and simplest way possible.  Presentation material is very understandable. Great class for new machine learning learners. Highly recommend it. The only downside is that the programming exercises are little too easy in my opinion. I feel like the best way to get your hands dirty is to do actual projects (do your own projects). These lectures are good for intuition and background of different types of Neural Network architectures. Other than that, Great material. Thanks Andrew!  ",0,0,Francis Salcedo,42463471

The key thing is whatever you study you have to keep coming back to look at the assignments what you've done , play with it, understand it, and see how you can relate this on theory.The video lectures is pretty striaght forward, not much mathematical jargon, but its intermediate level of sort, but i recommend to watch atmost 5 times every video if you didn't get through once, don't rush, take pen and paper and also write. You can also refer medium articles which are well curated from this course and provides a nice summary of overall what you've studied.And if you got more time, just try to read some good papers.

This course seems to have more references to academic papers than the others and Andrew is encouraging and helpful in guiding the student to the accessible and relevant sections of the papers.The exercises are instructive and not too challenging. Most of the challenges I had were due to my own programming errors and occasionally an error in how the exercise is set up [make sure to use the most recent version of Jupiter notebooks].

I am a working professional (13+ years), but just getting into the field of ML and AI. Apologies for flashing this preamble for every course that I review on coursera.This course is the 4th in a 5 part series offered by Dr. Andrew Ng on deep learning on coursera. I believe it is useful to take this course in order and it makes sense to study it as a part of the series, though technically that is not necessary.This is one of the best courses to take if you want to understand the basics of Convolutional Neural Networks.  CNN is a technically-difficult-to-understand, still-evolving field of Neural Networks, and it has thus far found remarkable uses in the field of computer vision.  Dr. Ng really exposes us to this cutting edge research, by explaining research papers, starting from its 'inception' to work that was published just two years ago. There are several aspects of CNNs that are difficult to understand, including the very basic ""convolution"" itself.  Much of that is made clear in his video lectures, which explore (and explain) a wide variety of Network Architectures in good detail.  The instructor videos are very good, usually 10 min long, and Dr. Ng tries hard to provide intution using analogies and real-life examples. The quizzes that accompany the lectures are quite challenging and help ensure that the student has understood the material well. As with the other courses, the programming exercises are the best part of the course. You get to practice, (1) decoding hand signs, (2) face verification, (3) face recognition, (4) single and multiple object detection (of cars in a street) ... All these problems are actual, real-life projects, which are extremely difficult to solve.  They help the student practice the strategies and also provide a jump-start for the student to use the code for their own problems at work or in school. Overall, this is an excellent course. Thank you Dr Ng and the teaching assistants, Thank you coursera.",0,8,Anand Ramachandran,3972709

Inevitably, due to the complexity of CNN, we have to rely on frameworks such as TensorFlow/Keras, etc. to do the coding, and they are covered in this course as well.  Not very deep, but sufficient. Wish they may pick PyTorch in the future as well.The notebook and grading systems sometime have issues though. You may think you submitted the right data but actually the server side won't think so.  Hard lessons learnt are:  a) save the original ipynb before coding, so you can always rollback in case notebook messed up; b) save a checkpoint before submit, this will force saving and ensure you submitted the latest data, otherwise, it may submit incomplete data - some cells may still have very old data even you modified a lot;  c) open anther local Jupyter notebook to experiment and mess around,  with interactive TensorFlow exception, but pay attention to the expression with random sequences, when you call eval() the second time, they may have totally different value even you reset the seed upon each cell, eval() will invoke your expression again which will consume more data in the random sequence;   d)  never use iPad to complete your noetbook coding, :-).

It provides all the basic theoretical and practical knowledge to get you started right away with CNNs and its applications in computer vision, including state-of-the-arts algorithms for image recognition, face detection and neural style transfer. With the help of the well-designed and challenging programming assignments you can practice and reinforce what you have just learned by doing it yourself, while becoming familiar with popular NN frameworks such as TensorFlow and Keras. I strongly recommend to spend some time reading the papers and articles referenced in the lectures as those provides additional insight and background to the course material, as well as reviewing and experimenting with the code available from the course assignments and also from GitHub.

Professor Andrew Ng, makes very comprehensible the content of the course.

Here why:

-He decompose every element of CNN. Convolutions, 1x1 convolutions and  pooling are very well explained, then by yourself can derive the dimensions of the output after applying these operations.
-He make notes on the fly for derive equations and  explain the purpose of the equations.  For me is much better that  only show slides, because makes give me the oportunity to think of the equation before is show.
-Professor give you  Intiition in every topic.
- He Make several examples of modern architectures of CNNs.Always write down in detail the architectures. 
-Clear notation, uses the same notation in programming exercises 
-Programming exercises are the best documente ones. This makes relatively easy to implement the exercises. If struggle with operations, they provide links to the documentation necessary.

Was an amazing course. 

Althogth I always think CNNs were some what  difficult and sometimes tedious topic (because of convolution and pooling arithmetic, and the use of ""volumes"" instead of matrices), this course make all clear and natural.

Thanks to the instructors for they hard work.
