12085810~COURSE!~XjrHsxa5EeafuQ601mutQw,1516152889598,2,0," I found this course repetitive, redundant and insulting to a person's intelligence. Career classes are usually taken in high school. I understand that it may be for some who have no idea what the corporate world is like or have trouble finding a job, but this was ridiculous. Even the most basic high school graduate  would know this stuff! ",0,0,Jonathan Golland,12085810
