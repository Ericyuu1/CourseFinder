5658763~COURSE!~czHuS4_GEeqjVQq1e8EnsQ,1673882999991,2,0,"The course pace is pretty slow. It repeats the same points over and over again. Discussions and lectures are very long. If you are a high school student and have no idea about technology, then it would provide a basis for you. If you are an engineering student, or a tech-savvy person, then you can move the lectures quickly by fast forwarding or checking the main points quickly. I started the honour track, but then I stopped it as it was unnecessarily long. I did not see much value in honour track when I check the learning/time-spent factor. But of course there are new things I learnt here too such as  Reality–virtuality continuum  and some other things. ",0,0,Anil Gencay Erdem,5658763
490132~COURSE!~czHuS4_GEeqjVQq1e8EnsQ,1645379716470,2,0,"The course is a very basic introduction to the field. As a complete novice to AR/VR, I did get some insight which will be useful. The lecturer is very enthusiastic, which is really awesome and encouraging.However, overall the course is rather shallow, there are unnecessary repetitions, there is a lot of talking with little substantial content. I had the stamina to complete the honors track, but in hindsight I find the time spent on the course mostly wasted. Some of the discussion provided at the course is unnecessarily long and of little practical value, which could be characterised as overly academic. For example, there is a lengthy explanation of what X in XR means, with a suggested reading of a multipage 'research' paper (by the lecturer); thre are other courses at Coursera with similar scope, which spend on this 1-2 minutes and then quickly proceed to much more practical issues. Throughout this and the other courses in this specialization, the lecturer seems to preferentially cite/reference publications of their own or from their students, which is surprising and disappointing. It gives the (possiby wrong)  impression that they have little familiarity with the field beyond their own work and opinions, do not follow up on others' work. Too much weight is placed on self-marketing instead of a balanced, fair overview of the field. Some parts of the presentation (in particular, examples of VR/AR interactions) seem not very well thought-through, the sight keeps moving around the scene in haphazard ways instead of focusing on the important areas (and explaining why), which at times is quite uncomfortable to watch.",0,9,Waclaw Kusnierczyk,490132

It also gave me the  opportunity to try my first ever accessibility audit of an VR  application: Mozilla Hubs, drlling down from the POUR principles as I  looked for equivalence between WCAG 2.2 guidelines, and where possible  related success criteria, and an immersive VR application. The course  also covered privacy, security, and ethics and it was also interesting  to see the intersection with accessibility and equity in those subject  areas.

For anyone wanting to investigate the technology, rather  than just wanting to program with Unity or Unreal Engine, I can't  recommend the course enough.
