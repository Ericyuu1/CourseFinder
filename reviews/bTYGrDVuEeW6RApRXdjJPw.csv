5403143~COURSE!~bTYGrDVuEeW6RApRXdjJPw,1544189369159,3,0,"Unfortunately I cannot say this is a good course as an iOS developer myself. I usually have problems generally with auto layout or other iOS specific controls which do not behave as I would expect them to. I am a self taught person, so I thought I might need a bit more systematic knowledge / training on the area.When I saw ""Best practices"" in the title of the course, I expected the course to cover not only the absolute basics, but some more tricky subjects. Unfortunately the course covers only very basics and do not cover subjects deeply. I would also like to recommend the course instructor to do some preparing before doing the course. There are a lot of errors happening on the record time of the video, and it almost feels like there has been no preparation. 3 stars as it could help beginners to learn general UI concepts, but definitely need to look somewhere else for understanding Autolayout better",0,3,Ikbal Kaya,5403143
