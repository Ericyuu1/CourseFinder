We are in 2020 and the technology is moving faster than ever, hence having materials dated 2016 shouldn't be tolerated by Coursera for a paid course.

So many clicks to get away from ""unsupported library"" type of errors. It's a shame as otherwise the course is well structured, and a little ""upgrade"" of the course materials which shouldn't be so difficult for the ""pro"" lecturers would simply bring it to 5 stars.

Dr. Adam Porter provides clear, informative, step-by-step videos, which I was able to comfortably enjoy at 1.5 times speed.  (He speaks clear and slow for people who may not have English as a first language.)  I chose this course over others because I already know iOS development and have been using Java for years. I wanted a course that focused primarily on the structure of beginner Android apps and not on Java or general topics in mobile development or CS. The assignments were just what I needed to exercise my new skills and really learn Android application flow and construction. In addition, I became familiar with the Android IDE.  The only small negative is that the examples are getting old since the course uses API level 18.  However, using level 18 did not impact what I was able to learn. All the examples and labs imported with only minor issues and ran fine. Reading the detailed lab assignments provided good instructions.
