41777249~COURSE!~948IYJRQEeeOpwoxDQI2lg,1666131427282,4,0,"I​ hadn't taken biochemistry yet and I found this course to be a wonderful introduction to it. The instructor took the time to explain all of his concepts in detail by sometimes providing different examples for them. The quizzes were also easy and digestible (5-6 questions at most) and covered the most important aspects of his videos. Even though I finished this course, though, I will continue to revisit from time to time to keep these concepts fresh in my mind. Edit: After formally reviewing this course, I found that there were some deficiencies. One being that there was no assigned readings- just lecture videos which is great for visual learners like me, but sometimes i needed that additional text to better understand the concepts. Also, biochemistry is  very difficult subject for most people; it would have been nice to have at least one peer-reviewed project, even if it was made optional so that we know we are going in the right track. Additionally, since the retaken quizzes reset themselves without offering new questions or changes to their original order, the value of those wrong questions sometimes went down as I retook them continously. Similarly, I didn't find an active forum to ask questions, so even if I posed one, I was doubtful that it would get answered with the lack of peer building embedded into the course. The threads just decrease in number after you drop off from Week 1 and the latest ones are about 1-2 years old. O​verall, though, I am still happy that I was able to take this course and be able to pass it to increase my knowledge in this subject. After closely looking through its deficiencies, I will look for another supplemental online course via Coursera or an actual textbook. ",0,0,Gita,41777249
