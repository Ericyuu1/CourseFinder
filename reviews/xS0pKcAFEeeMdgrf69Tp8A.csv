Now it was a bit frustrating having to jump over the videos that you did not wish to see. Also IMHO the questions in the middle of the videos were unnecessary interruptions.

Before this I took a couple of courses on git, but left them in between because either they were going too in detail or just weren't showing the consequences of ""what if we don't do that"".I am a visual learner. This course has introduces all topics in a clear and concise way that no one till now have done. I like the manner in which the mentor has divided the videos in small chunks. He knows what he say. In his each slide, he shows the graph representation of commits. It is really easy to follow. That's the thing that I loved the most (and that's why 5 stars) is, when I learn a concept, I think ""what if we don't do that."" If I don't clear up my doubt I lose the momentum and the course gets boring. Either I have to do that possibility manually and if I do that I get stuck and the doubt stays a doubt. But here, the mentor discusses the possibilities that you should do this when this happens. And most of the time it is what I think of! It saves my time and lets me continue to the course. Everything in one place.Another thing is his slides are so clear and the last project (exercise) is just amazing. Happy to take this course.
