It is really difficult for students without an ipad to work on some of the problems (with figures) because first, coursera does not support printing the quizzes using chrome, so most if not all of the graphs need to be hand-copied on paper, and second, the questions change across attempts, so they use different figures, and therefore students need to spend a whole lot of extra time on copying the figures and re-doing the calculations. If I were to redesign the course, I would have used a fixed set of figures, but different questions, for each attempt.
(2) The design of the final project is very poor. A lot of the feedback can be seen in the forum. IMO, it requires a significant re-design.

The course has nothing to envy to normal university courses and it is indeed a university course (from the online CS degree from U of I). I am really glad that this material is available to the public. Few points on which the course can be improved: * On the slides there are different notations and formats that are used. Making all of them uniform would help better in the understanding of the contents. * When providing topics and algorithm, please also provide also actual examples and explanation of what kind of problems we are trying to solve. For example it is not clear what problem we are trying to solve with the Multicast Problem, since some time ordering algorithm seems more appropriate. * The code in the programming assignment is terrible. It needs a serious review. It is supposed to be C++ code, but in reality it uses many of the C-style programming paradigm that are very outdated. Also all the creation/handling of raw pointers are completely wrong, many times a simple reference could be used. Encoding messages have never been more complicated, like JSON or BER encoding never existed.

There were also some relatively minor bugs: the first log message doesn't print with the correct prefix, and the grading script as provided doesn't run (IIRC it was because the #! isn't on the first line). Since this course could be some people's first introduction to C++ I feel that it's important to set a good example, and to keep the code simple and safe.Secondly the symbols used for things were often inconsistent between slides, which was occasionally confusing but should be easy to fix.Despite these issues I still think this is a great course, it just could be a little bit better.",0,0,David Shepherd,9641768

14424517~COURSE!~op_vMOGiEeWr4g7T_DyXNw,1564485781629,5,0,"I thought the class was quite good.  Dr. Gupta is very knowledgeable about the subject and presents the material well.  This is listed as a beginner level class.  I think it is worth noting that this could only be considered as beginner for people that already have a decent background in computer science.  People not familiar with algorithm will likely sind themselves somewhat challenged.One suggestion:The quizzes are quite difficult, which is fine, however the only feedback you get is pass/fail.  To give the student a better understanding of the material, it may be helpful to have a one or two question quiz after each lecture.  These should be of the complexity that is expected on the exam (as compared to the in-lecture questions which are quite easy).  For these mini-quizzes, solutions with explanations could be provided.Lastly, the programming project is in C/C++.  Many people seem to be complaining about why this isn't in a different language.  Perhaps more of an explanation for the language choice is in order. (e.g. it wouldn't really make sense to implement distributed processing algorithms in Java due to the speed requirement.)  C/C++ is listed as a prerequisite, so if you don't have this in your background, you should be prepared to spend some time learning at least the minimum, particularly use of pointers and pointer arithmetic.",0,5,Oren Eisner,14424517
