103643410~COURSE!~LSoKBevAEeuMJBKEeeVFmQ,1648555834042,1,0,"G​rammar and spelling are incorrect, making the course hard to read sometimes. You get alot of code, but not all code is explained. So you might know where to use it, but not how it works. The asignments have incorrect anwsers. So you do the asignment, but it keeps saying your awnser is wrong. Even when you use the code they give you, its still wrong. And i know for a fact that my awnser is right.A​ll in all i feel like this course purely gives you alot of code, but it doesn't teach you anything that you can use within a project.",0,0,Thijs Everaarts,103643410
