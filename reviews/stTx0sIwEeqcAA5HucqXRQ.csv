It is basically a curation of videos and texts that have made the rounds on the internet. What little dialog there is in between is incredibly presumtuous and unsubstantial. If you are looking to be another bobbing head in woke culture, you might appreciate this course. If you are looking to study the topic of race relations with any academic rigor whatsoever, you're wasting your time. ",0,1,Sean Wooldridge,6023500

I learned a lot from the content and enjoyed there was a nice mix of reading material, videos, and podcasts throughout the course. I'm Canadian and this is quite heavily focused on American  history and terminology but it's still very applicable here in Canada and informative. My one dislike is that the final course assignment/evalution is peer marked so you can't complete the course until someone marks your material. Because this course is now a few years old I'm concerned that it will take awhile before someone sees my final assignment and marks it so that I can receive the course certificate of completion. I would have loved to add the certificate of completion to my LinkedIn and be reimbursed at work but I can't do either until I've completed the course. I really wish that this was an auto-marked assignment like the glossary terms at the beginning of the course as I can see this being a problematic feature. ",0,2,Ali Thompson,79123156

This may be difficult for some people, as it was for me, but I encourage you to stick with it and really process your thoughts and feelings.  I am ongoingly and continually surprised at the way the conditioning I received all my life resurfaces. The course consists mostly of readings and videos, with two discussion prompts and no quizzes.
