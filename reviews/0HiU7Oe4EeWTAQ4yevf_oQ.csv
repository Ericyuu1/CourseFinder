20339341~COURSE!~0HiU7Oe4EeWTAQ4yevf_oQ,1604889115878,1,0,Wow... I've taken several courses on this site and this one is just not good in several ways. There are technical issues with the volume. The summary of information is really lacking detail. The section on R is not remotely useful if you have never used R before.,0,0,Alexander De Bruyne,20339341
51284926~COURSE!~0HiU7Oe4EeWTAQ4yevf_oQ,1598453655313,1,0,"Compared to the other courses in the specialization, this course is not good. The professor mostly recites what he knows, but he is not trying his best to explain new concepts to students. Explanations should be more thorough, finding different ways to explain things, not just putting a slide and repeating. Examples are too far away from concepts, so the concept is explained without an example and later the example is givien. This makes it harder to understand the concept.

Nothing obscene, but certainly some major frustration with format, inconsistencies in scoring and format, information not reviewed in the course on some of the quizzes, the fact that Coursera keeps trying to sell me the specialty, the lack of ANY moderator on the discussion board to provide assistance...and can go on with the technical issues to but I won't!",0,0,Margie Hertneck,3694359

65642828~COURSE!~0HiU7Oe4EeWTAQ4yevf_oQ,1597896811428,2,0,"I agree with the other reviewers. This course was terrible. Unlike other professors who have taught courses in the survey specialization, Professor Valliant made no attempt to explain the concepts in a way that would be comprehensible to an educated layperson. Instead, the lectures were rushed and laden with unexplained jargon. In order to have a minimal grasp of what is being presented, you must have a foundational knowledge of intermediate statistics and basic econometrics. Anything less than that and you'll be in over your head.",0,2,Patrick Calderon,65642828
3530468~COURSE!~0HiU7Oe4EeWTAQ4yevf_oQ,1541221885781,2,0,"There is scope for a lot of improvement in terms of quality of content as well as videos. There also appeared to be technical issues in the quizzes wherein the correct responses were often returned as incorrect & vice-versa, for a few quizzes. Without a moderator, queries are not addressed and nobody appears to be keeping track of the feedback. I was disappointed in the course since the previous courses in the specialization were far better designed and executed. ",0,0,Anandita Ghosh,3530468
3788943~COURSE!~0HiU7Oe4EeWTAQ4yevf_oQ,1482595256435,2,0,"While this course seems to have potential, there are many aspects of it that don't result in a great learning experience.  The course resources comprise of videos and notes.  The videos are informative but the notes are fairly lacking.  Perhaps the biggest issue that I found with this course was the disconnect between the material covered in the videos and that which was tested on the quizzes.  Often times the quiz questions were either painfully easy or worded in such a way that was not verifiable in any of the class resources.  As a result, confusion occurred sometimes more often than true learning.  A topic such as missing data is naturally very complex and I wouldn't expect a short course on Coursera to be able to adequately cover it.  However, I do think that a lot more could be done to improve the value of this course even if that means changing the scope of the materials.  Also, the lack of responsiveness to issues raised on the forum and issue-reporting buttons was a disappointment.",0,3,Evan,3788943

However, the content of this course is actually quite barren, practices are easy and not closely refective of the corresponding videos. The fourth week is most interesting and I was happy to know that multiple imputation is actually not key on the ""imputation"" part. It emphasizes the fact that missingness should be considered as uncertainty in modelling. After all, this is a interesting course and can be better designed and delievered. Thanks to the team.
