21469803~COURSE!~8v8HU7DhEeiXMBJXqTx_-g,1626416501842,3,0,N‚Äãice overview and continuiation from part 1. But the videos are a little too short with the majority with less than a minute's worth of actual subject matter. I spent almost as time clicking and waiting for videos to load than the subject matters themselves. Would be better if it also came with a simple deck of slides to refer back to after the course.,0,0,Irvin Tang,21469803

As someone trained in Western/allopathic medicine, the two courses made me appreciate a little better the difference between the medical system that I am used to and TCM, which is also quite popular in my country. While I was hoping for a presentation of the current state of critical evidence on TCM approaches for various diseases, I know that these are not the courses for those issues. I was positively surprised by the details shared in both courses, reflected in the quiz questions, and some moments of feeling overwhelmed while moving through the material reminded me of my initial years in medical school. Nevertheless, outsiders to the TCM system, either as practitioner or patient, who are beguiled on what it can offer in terms of promoting and restoring health are recommended to take the two introductory courses by CUHK.",0,0,Aedrian Abrilla,41195652
