Even I don't get the certificate for specialization I am not going to finish this module.

This is not a total beginner's content, but the videos are spoken too fast, like the professor was pressured to make it as short as possible. I had to watch some of the videos at 0.8x speed, instead of my usual 1.3x. Moreover, this was the first time I slow down a video.Several lessons were just read from the slides followed by a long abstract mathematical digression without any companion material (ie, slides), so you have to listen and imagine all the variables and formulas in your head, since there is no illustration or guide of what is being said. I'm a visual learner, what makes it even worse.Be prepared to look for resources elsewhere if you take this course and you are not familiar with module arithmetic. I'm not exaggerating when I say most of what I learned in this module were from YouTube videos... at least this module gave me a structured syllabus and topics to look for.Also, compared to the previous modules, it lacks a lot on exercises and questions to fix the subject. The code exercises were most often cryptic for me and demanded lots of trial and error. The reason for this were the poor explanations and the requirement to use the algorithms introduced in class, which were not always what YouTube videos used.I was expecting it to be more step by step, but I feel like it is a quick review for people who have taken the subject before.",0,1,Juliano Penna,23410024

Alex and Michael did a great job with making interactive lectures in Graph Theory, but for some reason, the Number Theory lectures were much more textbook-like recitations. There were certainly times in the lecture when I felt like I would want to see them on the whiteboard. There were also times when critical steps of a proof were not really emphasized (or on the slides at times) and it was very confusing.
