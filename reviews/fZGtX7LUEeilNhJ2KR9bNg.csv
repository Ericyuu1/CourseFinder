Videos aside, this course is a complete waste of time for working professionals. The biggest time-wasters are in the final 6th week. First, the course instructors deliberately create a confusing assignment and label it as a UI/UX challenge. Most people who posted said they wasted minimum 45 minutes just trying to figure out the assignment; I know I did. Second, after you get through listing all of the UX violations, they drop a bigger time-wasting bomb by asking students to repeat the previous assignment (which was done in an Excel grid format)  but this time in a report format and the example provided is 40 PAGES LONG!!!!! What the heck?!!! No one has time for this foolishness.Clearly someone who has ZERO professional work experience threw this course together because it's a complete time waster.
