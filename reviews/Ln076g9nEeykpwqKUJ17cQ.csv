95757542~COURSE!~Ln076g9nEeykpwqKUJ17cQ,1635980496124,3,0,"It is easy to understand, but it seems a bit chaotic and there's a lot of ""fluff"" that is not really necessary. Also it would have been easier to give out the link somehow instead of searching through google pages (since google results always change with time). What bugged me the most is that there's one special function at the end (percipitation chart) that is never explained. In the video you can see that it has been quickly exchanged after it was explained, but no word on it at all. ",0,2,Lisa Blu Mu,95757542
