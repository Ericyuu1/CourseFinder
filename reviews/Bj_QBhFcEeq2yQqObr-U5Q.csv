Thanks for the course and making it available via Coursera.Some observations for potential areas of improvement from my side:1. The BRI & books written by the Tapscotts are mentioned too many times. I sometimes felt like I was attending a drawn out marketing event as opposed to a professional course2.

57313253~COURSE!~Bj_QBhFcEeq2yQqObr-U5Q,1591071432752,4,0,Course is excellent and thanks to Don Tapscott and Alex Tapscott. However I am extremely fed up with Coursera as Coursera technical team is now running out of excuses to fix a simple problem on my course certificate.
