14339782~COURSE!~ElOJTVx9EeWdYw4a7RCoOw,1608863236242,1,0,"I recommend that you obtain an independent review of the homework on this course, specifically to address the questions of whether the course prepares learners for the homework, and whether the questions are are clear to learners. I find that the answers to these questions are NO for weeks 4 and 5. In week 5, for example, question 1(1) asks about a single state |phi-f> which is not defined in the question or in the introduction to the homework or in the lectures.  Questions 1(2-5) use a technique that has not been taught in the lectures and is not always part of an undergraduate course in QM.  This kind of thing can be extremely disappointing for learners, and frankly implies that the setter of the questions was not actually competent to do so.",0,0,Richard Dean,14339782

92862~COURSE!~ElOJTVx9EeWdYw4a7RCoOw,1615134673694,2,0,"The subject matter is very interesting and is introduced gradually from the most simple situations to more complex ones.However many key results are presented without any proof, coming out of the blue. The expressions for the photodetection signals are not sufficiently related to first principles. This is a bit disappointing. Perhaps they assume the student lacks the kowledge to understand the proofs? This would be a contradiction because the homeworks require a very good knowledge of quantum mechanics and its formalism. The forum seems completely inactive. My questions remain unanswered. ",0,0,Thierry Mataigne,92862

But there are two things I am not so satisfied:  first, there is some typo in the video, and it would be better if the professors can add a part for the correction, just like in the last video section of the week 1. Second, for some attached documents (papers), I couldn’t get the access to them since I don’t have an account for those scientific paper websites.
