88732296~COURSE!~nnVxd_DjEemB_Q7YXIeE6g,1640210398653,4,0,T​he instructor was knowledgeable and articulate.  The practice quizzes were helpful in preparing for the weeks' quizzes. Only drawback was the peer graded assignment - this was frustrating and of not much use.  Assignment was frustrating in that I found my peer reviewer completely missed the fact that I had included examples of Fair Act principles since they were not spelled out 1-2-3.  When I had to redo and actually made it much more basic then it was ok. This is not an opportunity to do professional level writing.  I will avoid any other courses with peer review assignments. As a former teacher and a senior exec in homeland Security I found this exercise not worth while.,0,3,Marianna Merritt,88732296

But this was informative and I really felt like I had learned a great deal and knew expansive parts of the program.  I liked the peer review but would have liked to see the notes if there were any.  Also, I did have trouble trying to get the memo written on the space provided.  It kept telling me it was too long and I'd barely begun and then when I went just to a paragraph style it would erase sentences when I thought it was done.  So it took longer and was not in the style that I was hoping.  The one that I reviewed was in the style that I originally chose. So I felt disappointed that I wasn't able to present the answers as i would have liked.  But great course.",0,1,Lois Ann Johnson,84719955
