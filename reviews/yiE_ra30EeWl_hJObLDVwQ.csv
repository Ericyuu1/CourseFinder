21716138~COURSE!~yiE_ra30EeWl_hJObLDVwQ,1490278127924,2,0,"This required a lot of work with little gained.  Some questions, referring to budgets and site layouts, required skills that weren't learned in the course.  The 3 word feedback comments I got from all reviewers did not feel like worthy responses to the amount of time I put into this project.  Additionally, I was graded negatively by some reviewers without reason, as happened in other sections.  Overall, not really worth the money for a paid certificate.  Would be nice if maybe for the capstone only, some sort of professional or professor weighed in on your project for some legitimate and helpful critique.",0,8,David Byer,21716138
10291038~COURSE!~yiE_ra30EeWl_hJObLDVwQ,1627841951263,3,0,"Generally, the content prepared by the Medill School team is great. It's very well structured and comprehensive. The videos are well produced, for content that is getting a bit old. However, I was very disappointed in the way the grading worked, especially during the Capstone Project. I had to wait over 4 weeks to start working on the project and there was nobody from faculty who would review work - only peers. It's understandable that they wouldn't have time to review so many students' projects, but I had to review really shitty projects from my peers and I had put a lot of effort into my own project. It's really not great how Coursera can get away with this, and I'm especially concerned that Northwestern University gives out certificates to below average work. I will not sign up for another specialization again - it's not worth the money.",0,1,Alejandra Solís,10291038
63108499~COURSE!~yiE_ra30EeWl_hJObLDVwQ,1598866703825,3,0,"Content was useful, but method for knowledge testing was less than ideal. I'm not a fan of the blind leading the blind in education: please replace a good portion of the peer-reviewed assignments with some sort of quantitative assessment from the university. Additionally, I had to wait nearly a full month to submit my capstone assignment because of the rigid pace of this specialization. By the time I was allowed to submit my project, I'd moved on to other things and really didn't care about finishing this.",0,5,Kathryn Bell,63108499
14773116~COURSE!~yiE_ra30EeWl_hJObLDVwQ,1475529270873,3,0,"While I appreciated the challenge of the capstone project, I didn't feel like the assignment's requests accurately aligned or represented what was provided in the lecture series. As someone who bought this course as one large pack (four courses, one capstone project), it would've been nice to see more intersection. I felt a little ""in the dark"" on some of this. Given the short timeline to finish the work, too, many of these requests need more time (e.g. building personas needs user research, ideally). All in all, a good challenge to a content professional, but don't expect all of this to align with what you learned in the lecture series.",0,5,Erin Schroeder,14773116

I​ should add some extra, I'd say that a more interactive section would be well appreciated. I am thinking of professors speaking more about their personal experiences as an example.T​hanks to all!",0,0,Fulvia Accoto,92816830

26185193~COURSE!~yiE_ra30EeWl_hJObLDVwQ,1521699543208,5,0,"I loved the capstone project. Since I am still preparing to become a Content Strategist and did not have any actual project work to show people, it gave me an opportunity to showcase what I have to offer. Also, as an Instructional Designer, I believe that, ”Doing is the one of the best ways of learning"" and after completing all the courses in this certification, a hands-on experience is what I needed to feel confident of my knowledge of the subject and skill. The best part was how the project was designed to be unique for everyone and yet had a consistent brief and background. Everyone designed their strategy and the web page for a particular geography, which made it unique but with the same brief in mind, which helped maintain a consistent style and approach. Peer reviewing other's work was also a greta way to learn.Thanking You
