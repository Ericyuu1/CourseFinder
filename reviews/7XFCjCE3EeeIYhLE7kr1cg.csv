56156026~COURSE!~7XFCjCE3EeeIYhLE7kr1cg,1598020282966,1,0,"I give this review not be cruel. I am certain the course designer made this course with the best intentions. However, this course is dangerously tool focused and does not spend much time discussing the finer points of purpose and demand. As a result, tools are introduced in isolation. This can give the impression that the tools can be applied universally but that is not the case in reality. Wrong tool in wrong situation equals disastrous results. What if you tried to do a value stream analysis on an emergency room without really understanding demand? Why would you even try?  Similar point with the discussion around metrics. This will be determined both by process type and customer purpose. In some service processes, takt is entirely irrelevant and drives the wrong behaviour. I get what they're trying to show you. But it lacks a lot of context and guidance. Without that context guidance, you may be giving people a dangerous level of confidence. ",0,3,Michael Jacobs,56156026

On disadvantage is difficult to access feedback from peers and see their feedback.  There was also no one to inquire if you submitted a project and had questions as to whether it was as intended.  Also, it was difficult to upload the projects.",0,0,Debra Daniels-Ellis,90437646

We in healthcare are normally responsible people but we are also reactive to situations than active. I am trying to still find ways to incorporate this as a culture rather than an idea.",0,0,ajay kohli,50198294
