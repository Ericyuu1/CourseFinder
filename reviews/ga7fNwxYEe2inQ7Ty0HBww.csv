6795712~COURSE!~ga7fNwxYEe2inQ7Ty0HBww,1673382715617,1,0,"I am stuck with this course as I was working on it when Meta was transitioning from the 10 course react native specialisation to a streamlined 8 course react native specialisation.
Now I finished the course but it is not counted as a finished course in the 8 course of react native specialisation. I cannot delete or restart this course because: I already did the course.
Meta staff is already ignoring me for 2 weeks as I explain my situation in every forum of every week of this course.I get no reply. No help. No solution. Nothing, meanwhile I cannot finish the react native specialisation.",0,1,Jaron Willem Adriaan van Golverdinge Schut,6795712
