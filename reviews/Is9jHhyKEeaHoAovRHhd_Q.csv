26442155~COURSE!~Is9jHhyKEeaHoAovRHhd_Q,1631986466773,4,0,"Lecture delivery: Very engaging, in general.  I do appreciate the historical background material.

Difficulty: Way too easy.  The professor seems to assume that the audience is weak in Math & Physics.  The prerequisites for the course should include at least elementary Mechanics and Vector Algebra.

Near the end, one problem should have been presented in 3D [t, x, y, z] to reinforce that the the previous problems were based on holding 2 of the 3 space dimensions constant.  Leaving the details of the vector algebra as an exercise for the student to verify is justified with a change in the prerequisites.

There was way too much explanation of algebra manipulation.  Much should have been left as an exercise to the student!

The mass/energy issue with respect to the speed of light should have been presented.  This was skipped and could have been presented in a general sense with accompanying Internet GR references for derivations (E.g. DrPhysicsA on YouTube.com).

Problem sets should not be optional!  These are good student reinforcement opportunities.

A presentation which needs to be revisited IMO: ""The Twin Paradox"" part 3.

51809266~COURSE!~Is9jHhyKEeaHoAovRHhd_Q,1590070627502,4,0,"I’ve enjoyed this course, which I’ve been following during the UK’s Covid 19 lockdown. It’s kept me happily occupied and, thanks to Larry Lagestrom’s generally careful and enthusiastic exposition, I’ve finally got my head round the relativity of simultaneity and its role in explaining the ‘pole in the barn’ paradox - something I never quite managed when introduced to special relativity as a physic’s undergraduate more than 50 years ago. So, a big thank you to Prof Lagerstrom.I’ve a few reservations. First, the treatment of Einstein’s second postulate seems to be needlessly confusing. Starting in week 3, and then repeatedly throughout the course, the lecturer maintains that, by the phrase  ‘the constancy of light’, used to describe the second postulate, Einstein means that light is a wave, implying, drawing an analogy with, say, sound waves, the the existence of a ‘supporting’ transmission medium - the luminiferous ether. It’s then maintained that, somehow - I can’t follow the argument - Einstein combined this interpretation of the constancy of light with the principle of relativity to deduce that the velocity of light is constant for all observers. I’ve read the relevant bit of Einstein’s 1905 paper several times, and I just don’t think this is what Einstein is saying at all. What it actually says is: ‘Llght is always propagated through empty space with a definite velocity c, which is independent of the motion of the observer’. There’s no recourse to any sort of argument, instead, it’s simply stated as a fact - just what you’d expect for a postulate. From some of the posts in the discussion forum, it would appear I’m not the only one having difficulties with this issue.My second reservation - following on from the first - is that there’s too much time and effort devoted to the Michelson-Morley experiment. There’s no ether, the experiment was doomed to failure and all that time and effort deriving expressions for possible phase shifts - using highly questionable assumptions about the speed of the local ‘ether wind’ - could have been better spent.It’s a small point, but my last reservation is with the derivation of length contraction, which I found hard to follow. The alternative approach - using a light clock sending pulses longitudinally along a train - seems much more straightforward and follows on nicely from the transverse clock used to explain time dilation.Where I think the course really scores is in the derivation of the Lorentz transforms and the use of space-time diagrams. If you can work your way past possible early confusions and press on to these key topics,; you'll be amply rewarded for your troubles.Alongside the course I’ve read Larry Lagestrom’s book, ‘Young Einstein: From the Doxel Affair to the Miracle Year’. It’s a good read and is particularly good at explaining the content of all Einstein’s 1905 papers.",0,0,Roger Dettmer,51809266

When I started the course, i went forward with the pre-existing notion that Special Relativity is really tough to grasp. But Larry (the instructor) was somehow able to take such complex ideas and distill them down to a straightforward and easy to understand explanation. His teaching was honestly amazing, and Stanford is lucky to have him as a teacher. As for the course itself, it was a perfect balance between a quantitative and a qualitative approach. There isn't a lot of math, but at the same time it's just challenging enough, and it's made better by Larry's aforementioned amazing teaching! The tests are relatively easy (pun most definitely intended) and can be challenging at times. I started the course with a basic knowledge of relativity and not a big lover of Physics (I'm more of a Chemistry and Biology guy). But i've ended the course with a newfound love for Physics (and actually started delving deeper into Astronomy, Quantum Mechanics and String Theory).

If the algebra is too difficult, you can zone out and still get the point in the conclusion. A must 101 course for anyone interested in this subject.

The quality of this course can
be described by just one word: Excellent!As
a former commercial instructor, I very much appreciated the didactic
qualities of prof. Lagerstrom and his basic motto: Festina LenteThe
	theory of special relativity is presented step by
	step in an
	incremental,
	systematic and progressive manner.This
	includes much repetition and a rather slow pace. But don't think to
	soon that you can skip some parts. Relativity is counter-intuitive
	and often
	confusing. So, be patient and follow the pace of the instructor. Do
	all of the practice and
	final quizzes.
	They
	are designed in such a way that you only get them right if you
	really understood the lectures.The
	instructor doesn’t use slides but writes everything down on a
	white board. This is a strong didactic method: it forces you to
	follow all of the steps and invites you to take notes.
I
particularly liked the biographical details and the background of
Einstein's thinking. This makes it easier to understand the person of
Einstein and the background of his thinking process.At
the beginning of the course the instructor offers as a bonus some
good didactic advices on how to study (online).Larry Lagerstrom and course

I'm grateful to Stanford University-Coursera and of course, to all the faculty mentors who understood and responded to my questions at almost speed=c.

Not the case here.  I took this as a refresher and found myself impatient and a bit frustrated at the hand-holding. Paradoxically, I was also comforted by the hand-holding ;) ...SR & GR are an odd pair because you do not get an intuitive sense of things until you bring gravity & acceleration & equivalency principle into the picture. Thus the need for hand-holding, I suppose... Anyone whom has a functional understanding of Newtonian physics needs to extend this to SR, then GR (at least qualitatively) to gain a more intimate understanding of the nature of nature. Don't be intimidated by Einstein. The man's insights were most likely due to single-minded focus and persistence.

This course is simply outstanding. It is hard to imagine how Dr Lagerstrom's construction of the course might be improved upon. Starting from some very basic principles and with the help of a little simple school algebra, step by step he progressively lays out for us some of the counter-intuitive yet fundamental rules by which the universe functions. Each step is in itself simple, logical, and well within the scope of the most average of learners. But upon course completion, since the student has followed the entire process step by step from basic principles, they emerge with a depth of understanding of apparently complex matters that prove not to be impenetrable at all.Dr Lagerstrom has managed to show that nobody needs to be afraid of this subject, or be concerned that it is somehow beyond their understanding.

My new understanding of ""frames of reference"", relative length, leading clocks, time dilation and temporal plotting has all but destroyed the science behind all of my favorite television shows... but I can calculate the Lorentz factor and truly can mentally conceptualize the effects of near light movement and it has made me believe that black holes exist as a continual part of the Big Bang, as time restarts when you reach the center (and nearly stops on the way).

I always was a bit interested in Astrophysics and even had LOTS of books on my shelf in the hope that someday I would start reading and learning - all by myself.  But I couldn't gather enough motivation - and so it never really worked out. But after taking up the course and going through the different topics - I feel that I can begin a more serious approach to studying Relativity and can tackle some of the standard books on the subject.  I don't have a background in Physics, but that didn't prove to be a problem while going through the course.  I was able to complete each week's contents by spending around 45mts-an hr each day.  Was also maintaining my own set of notes - I'm sure I might be looking at them again someday when I'm exploring the subject bit more in depth. The quizzes were somewhat easier that I expected and I'm happy I was able to get some of my doubts clarified promptly through the forums.My only concern was that  a) I would have liked the course to be bit more technical/mathematical  and   b)  I wish I had completed the 'optional problems' too at the end of each week :). But these are not really so critical as it was an introductory course and I didn't have any basic understanding of Relativity prior to this.

After all, this theory was developed by a genius and it involves math, something that many people shy away from. Doesn't it take a background in physics and confidence in your math ability to get something out of the class? No. The remarkable thing about this class is that is presented at multiple levels simultaneously. If you are confident in your knowledge of physics and math, the explanations and optional exercises will be a welcome challenge. At the same time, the general concepts are explained in such a manner that you'll learn enough about the Special Theory of Relativity to get the ""big picture"" even if you don't immerse yourself in the mathematics.

The content covered most of the main aspects of Special Relativity, and the instructor did a top notch job of explaining how the various aspects of the theory are derived and many implications of the Theory. The maths involved in this course is no more than high-school level algebra with a few tricks, and as such the course should be within most people's reach with a bit of effort. Mind you, the concepts themselves are somewhat counter-intuitive, so be prepared to think a lot about the implications. However, all that being said, I highly recommend this course!

The lecturer starts off each week with some Einstein quotes and goes to great depths to explain the basic concepts at a level that is accessible to students with minimal experience of maths and physics. The concepts are firmly drilled in with plenty of optional quizzes after each mini-topic, and a summary video at the end of each week. The lectures are long but anyone short on time has the option to go straight to the weekly summary/quiz, and/or play videos at up to 2x speed (especially in weeks 2 and 3).
The main highlight for me was the explanation of the famous Twins Paradox and other related paradoxes which are resolved by understanding frames of reference and the relativity of simultaneity. Another bonus was an explanation of the bending of light by gravity through a simple thought experiment involving an accelerated elevator.
Some important topics not covered in the course, or only hinted at, are: treatment of accelerated reference frames (required to derive the relativistic rocket equations), relativistic momentum and kinetic energy (required to calculate the rocket fuel required) and relativistic energy (used to derive Einstein's mass-energy equivalence formula).
