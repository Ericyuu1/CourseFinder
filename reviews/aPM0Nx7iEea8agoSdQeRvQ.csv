Before I get into it, I DO think that Truth tables and (more so) venn diagrams have value in visualizing the logic of some arguments.That being said,  There is so much impractical information that you are expected to know on quizes like the AEIO's and structure of certain truth tables that are just so wildly impractical that I can't imagine that they were put in the test for any other reason than a lack of creativity on Dr. Netas part.I also have a gripe with some of the jargon. Start with using ""conjunction"" instead of the truth-functional whatever that you repeat 6 times in a row to the point where I don't even know if the point is teaching more so than trying to entertain yourself in what seems like a mandatory teaching of something Dr. Neta does not want to do.Side note, it is strange and off-putting that Dr. Neta chooses so many examples where Walter is a ""dog abuser"" or purveyor of vodka and bourbon or some other seemingly negative example.

He is obviously an expert in Logic, and must be very intelligent to hold his academic position - so I have given the course a pass mark. For example his use of Venn Diagrams was sloppy. I had already worked out that I could use Venn Diagrams before he introduced the idea, and I had sketched unambiguous diagrams to help me visualize the use of quantifiers. The lecturer just used an X to mark the intersection between two sets. This is an imprecise way of showing the intersection, and he could have easily drew different Venn Diagrams that  unambiguously showed the various quantifiers.  Also why did the lecturer choose to sit in a crappy little room, and not even take time to remove distracting objects from the desk behind him etc.  To me he sent a signal that he couldn't even take time to arrange for a appropriate background  nor design clear visual aids for his students.

The reason is that terminology in videos is not 100% consistent with the exam content.

You just see ""You should not have selected this answer."" Okay, but WHY NOT? The learning experience would be better if an explanation would always be given.(3) Some parts are incomplete. For example, the topic on immediate categorical inferences only discusses conversion. It would have been nice to discuss the obversion and contrapositive inference as well. Another example is the lack of the explicit treatment of the biconditional introduction and elimination argument, while the conjunction and disjunction introduction and elimination methods are fully covered.(4) The time spent on the course is short in comparison to Think Again I. For example, week 3 contains less than an hour's effort. Week 2 is also rather short. Instead of cutting it short, useful concepts such as the square of opposition, which is pretty much the basis of the relations between categorical propositions, could have been discussed.(5) At the end of one of the lectures, three links are given for further practice. One of the links didn't work.(6) Some quizzes deal with material that is discussed in later sections.(7) The exam was unbalanced.
