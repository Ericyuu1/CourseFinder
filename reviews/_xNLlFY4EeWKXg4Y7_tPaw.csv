Because the videos and powerpoint slides were all filmed in a different language, the videos themselves were useless and provided no value to the course. I didn't play a single video because I can't understand French. The translations in the transcript were fine to get by; however, I missed a lot of valuable  information from the slides since all of the definitions and diagrams were in French and there was no translation provided.

Also, the English subtitles do not always exactly match the oral French version.Finally, the marking only based on quizzes that can be retaken several times makes it very easy in my view.

5682487~COURSE!~_xNLlFY4EeWKXg4Y7_tPaw,1485119539715,4,0,Through this course I was given a lot of information on water management policies throughout history. Sometimes the practical applications were difficult to visualize in a real-world context although there were many case studies shown (maybe because being from the U.S. we have a less politically complex system). A strong emphasis was placed on international laws that are relevant today. If I end up working within the water sector in the U.S. I expect that this knowledge will help me put my work into a broader perspective and help me find innovative solutions to problems.

I particularly enjoyed the fact that there were numerous case studies discussed such as the Nile basin or the Mekong basin. In order for you to improve the efficacy of this course i would suggest the following measures:a) a synopsis of the main laws and directives regarding the protection and management of water resource in the last course.b)  Further analysis on how to deal with certain general problems such as the case when a country upstream pollutes the waters that head to the country downstream, that you mentioned in your last video.

From the very young age I had the passion  in Water sector  and use to feel the bliss of the environment with cool air breeze  at  reservoir sites  and astonishing for the abilities of the creators. Its the gods grace that I spent my entire career either in planning water Resources projects or in representing interests of the state in inter state water disputes  before Tribunals and supreme court of India besides Water management issues in sharing waters of Krishna and Godavari rivers with the neighbouring state of Telengana. Thus  day- in  day - out my life is entangled with the subject of water and I thank the almighty for these opportunities.In this backdrop I found my self interested in taking up the online course 'Water Resources Management and Policy'  under Coursera even after my retirement. In my opinion  there is no end for learning.The course is very well designed  with concepts on governance of common water Resources,Institutional Resource Regime , Integrated water Resources management, Resolving water disputes and cooperation among the riparian states for utilisation of common resource.The course provided excellent insight in the above subject s with elaborate illustrations covering many international rivers such as Rhine, Meckong,Nile, Indus, Colorado etc . I  convey my thanks to the faculties for their efforts in rendering the  course material and teaching the concepts in a most professional way.I very much recommend the young engineers in the field of Water Resources Development to avail the opportunity which will give a wonderful insight in understanding the Interstate or International river water sharing.As a continuum I would like to suggest that Coursera may suitably design a separate new course  dealing with strategies for  conducting negotiations amongst the riparian states for  Interstate or International River water sharing.Thank you.
