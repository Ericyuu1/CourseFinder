118212363~COURSE!~It7SNTe-EeWCYBKNeFwojw,1676214368765,4,0,"I learned a lot in the course.   The instructor is excellent.  The assignments were of just the right number and difficulty, and they really help you solidify what you have learned in the lectures.  The reason I give it four stars is that there is a significant technical issue that really need to be addressed.  Specifically, AJAX calls produce CORS errors.  If you don't know what that means, Yaakov will teach you about it in the lectures for this course.  And trust me, you'll find that it's important when you go to do the assignments.  If you don't address it, your assignment will be dead on arrival: it will not function.  Things are supposed to be set up so that it's not an issue in the course.  But something is not working the way its' supposed to, and it's a big deal.   I originally gave 3 stars because of this.  However, I started another programming course, and the comparison compelled me to come back and upgrade this course to 4.  I don't say that to criticize the other course, but it's just a fact that for this course they have done a much better job with content delivery.  This course is excellent in that respect.  And that doesn't happen by accident.  As Yaakov points out in the last lecture, a lot of work has gone into this, and as you'll see, it shows.   However, there is this technical issue you will absolutely have to deal with. Even the instructor's code doesn't work as is.  It's not really that hard to find a work-around for the problem, but you have to be determined.  The vast  majority of peers' assignments that I reviewed were non-functional because the person either couldn't find a workaround, or didn't want to invest the time.  I was just bound and determined that my assignment was going to work, if at all possible.   The instructors must be aware of this issue.  If they're not, they should be, because I posted about on it the forums.  I never got a single response to my post from student, instructor or facilitator.   So, long story short.  It's a great course.  But you will have to deal with the CORS issue.  If not dealt with, no matter how correct your code is, your page won't even load.  It'll be dead on arrival.",0,0,Jason,118212363

But also, he explains clearly modules, controllers, directives, factories, and the thin but important difference between those last two.Filters, providers and also ui-router are teached as well. A small suggestion: don't understimate the course, because it can be easy in week 1 and 2, but becomes full of things to remember and to test in week 3 and especially in week 4: video lessons are just 10 minutes each but in those weeks are full of concepts to get aquainted with.My suggestion is, on week 4, to follow videos with pencil and paper, to create small schemes on how passing parameters works between a controller, a service, the html (which is NOT simple a view, but actively works passing parameters) and a component.If you did well in those weeks, week 5 will be much easier than the other weeks.A great course to manage angularJS!",0,3,Diego,35564555

My only complaint--and this is a nit-pick: sometimes the instructor labors points a bit.  But that's OK: it adds clarity to hear details repeated every time the subject comes up.  There's a lot of information and it is easy to forget something after the fact. If you take this course, you will enjoy it.

Yaakov's presentation makes it possible for me to finish it (while taking care of a baby!). The teaching material is well organised, step by step. For each topic, the theory is clearly presented first( but just enough to start an example) and then explained by coding examples. A brief summary of the theory will be made at the end so you get a chance to re-think about it. And since this course is about a framework, he doesn't just show you how to use it, but also explains how some functionalities are achieved by the framework. He even tries to explain why uses this framework, or any framework at all in the beginning, which may seem obvious but actually not, at least according to my experiences.
