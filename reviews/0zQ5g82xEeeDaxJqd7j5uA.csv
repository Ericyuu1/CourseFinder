17872805~COURSE!~0zQ5g82xEeeDaxJqd7j5uA,1609393923324,3,0,"The lessons were just vocabulary words with little to no context. While the pictures and word origins were helpful, we only get to understand how to use most of the words in the tests themselves. I think it would be more helpful to have sample sentences where we can see how the words are used. Also, I feel like there are a few words that are very similar in meaning but have different use cases, but this course doesn't show which one is more appropriate to use in certain scenarios. Aside from that, there were a few typos in both the lessons and tests that were still not corrected from months ago (as seen in some comments in the discussion threads), and the tests don't show you the correct answers once you've passed them (which could've been useful for review). Overall, this course has an alright value for HSK 3-4 learners since it has a lot of diverse words that is needed to expand vocabulary.",0,0,Carl Tan,17872805

The reason it lost two stars is because: (1) The necessity to complete a quiz before the next video unlocks. I found this really hindered my rate of progress. I prefer to learn a whole week of vocabulary on the first day, then memorize it and do all the quizes/tests at the end of the week. But the lock on videos prevents this.(2) The tests and quizzes had many clearly incorrect answers. I flagged about 10 questions throughout all the tests where the solution was clearly wrong.

It is possible to get every answer right for the identification of words and characters, however, it is impossible to understand the words in context.
