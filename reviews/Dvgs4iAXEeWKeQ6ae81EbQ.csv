73845168~COURSE!~Dvgs4iAXEeWKeQ6ae81EbQ,1608551994338,1,0,"First off, The teacher stutters way too much, making the videos feel as they were amateur YouTube pieces.Secondly, very little substance is offered in the video pills: there’s an infinity of 1 min to 2 min videos where just an ultra quick idea of the subject is given, with absolutely no deepening; what makes it even worse, you have to take the goddamn theme song intro AND outro for each video: within half an hour you heard that tune a good 25 times...Guest interviews, on the other hand, are extremely long and verbose, 15 minutes to one hour, hardly staying focused on a subject, and they constitute the main filler for this mediocre course.West Virginia university and Berklee offer significantly better online education on the subject.",0,1,Cristian Bressanelli,73845168

I enjoy as much as the next guy hearing sound guys talk and see how music is made, but this is not what the course is about. The course should be about the music business, and the instructor spends way too little course time discussing the core issues. Generally, it feels like the instructor touches upon the relevant topics, but never really explores them. I strongly recommend taking Berklee's ""Music Business Foundations"" instead.

Professor Gunderman's passion and knowledge on the subject was astonishing and the modules more than thorough.

Now, having gone through the course materials, I am more determined than ever to support the music community, pay attention to industry developments, and engage others in crucial discussions about the worth of music and the obligations we have to artists.
