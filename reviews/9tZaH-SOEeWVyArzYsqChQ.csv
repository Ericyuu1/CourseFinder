5671247~COURSE!~9tZaH-SOEeWVyArzYsqChQ,1496544935503,3,0,"Similar to the Part 1 of the course, it has really good lectures and a very poor programming assignment.
The lectures are very good: relevant and algorithms are explained step-by-step. The talks about real-world cloud applications are great for people in my position, looking to ""scale up"" a business operation by using cloud.
The programming assignment compounds upon the problems of the first one. The biggest issue is that it asks you to use code from the first assignment, so if your first assignment was not implemented very well, expect to have to fix that to even continue. It continues the trend of improper use of pre-C++ 11 concepts, and causes even more problems due to the design of the problem to solve.",0,0,Patrick Santos,5671247

The difficulty and relevance of the lectures diminish as we approach the end of the course.  The lecture slides are excellent. In fact, they're detailed enough that you can get through most of the course without having to watch the recordings. I might have watched about 40m of videos for the entire course. Granted that I've had some prior knowledge about distributed systems. So, try it out if you find the lecturer's ""ah"" ""um"" too distracting.  The programming assignment is terrible. The specification omits many relevant system conditions. So much for ""Before solving any problem, specify its System Model"". Be sure to check the forum for these missing specifications before starting. It's not as daunting as it seems. Also, the quality of the provided code is the worst I've ever seen in my 5 years of Software development. Whoever wrote the code probably didn't get paid enough to care.",0,1,Vy Hong,445454

If the course could improve its assessments  and project it would be 5 stars. The quiz feel unfair at times when they ask questions that weren't covered or not emphasized in lecture. The final project is the biggest negative of the course. It is tedious and you will spend more time learning the template code and reverse engineering the auto grader than you will implement anything. I'm still not sure why they made an ""entry"" class but didn't use that data type in their ""Hash Table"" implementation... On the bright side this project is better than Part 1 because it actually allows you to use newer c++ concepts and not have to deal memcpy and low level details. ",0,0,Austin Zimmer,37034921

On the other hand, it's very hard sometimes to see the forest for the trees. It obviously also limits the depth of the material covered and the understanding thereof.2) The final programming exercise is lacking in quality - probably the weakest part of this course. There has been obviously a great effort made to prepare this exercise, but the code quality is very poor, not to mention sparse and poor code documentation. The exercise specs are not specific and detailed enough - it took some time guessing about what is actual algorithm is required to implement. I've spent much more time trying to understand the code and the exercise requirements than actual on actual programming.
