It is full of uncertainty.I wish that the evaluation in every week is not all by ESSAYS. Actually I already have done in April 2020 for all the assignment but need waiting until June for lucky, to get reviewed peers-by-peers for the essay. Please, combine it with multiple choices with essay.  That will better. Thanks.",0,1,Ade Brian Mustafa,32781896
39773492~COURSE!~tnrJxoT-EeiVSAqvdu2T-g,1555950917393,3,0,"The course material is superb. I learnt a lot about setting up business models to go hand in hand with sustainable landscape restoration. The system of working in groups is very effective and it was interesting to collaborate on a Bolivian based project. It is a great idea to set up the course on Slack to allow quality communication. However, the lack of involvement from the course coordinators was very disappointing. I expected them to lead discussions with all of the participants, or at least within the groups. Moreover, several times my group directly asked the coordinators questions but received no response. ",0,2,Tom Lovett,39773492

The course content is very novel. Videos give a clear content 
of the concept. It is very enjoyable. I learnt a lot of new skills such as
stakeholder analysis, three layers of the business model canvas (economic, social
and environment) etc. The content is very applicable for practitioners.  However, the formation of groups for the
assignment is bit difficult as enrolments for the course is not fixed.  Communication with team members also
difficult. So I completed the course individually but I believe, better results
can be achieved with group works.
