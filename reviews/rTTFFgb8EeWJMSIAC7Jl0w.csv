I have a job, sometimes I have to travel and I did this course on my free time in order to keep improving and developing my career. So I studied and took the exams gladly. But the surprise came when I realized there were weekly assignments... which had to be corrected by other students every single week. This made the course very unpleasant, because every single week I had to do this assignments and if I were to miss one of it (because I was abroad), then there was no way to pass this course anymore... on that period. I had to change the dates again... and pay more because I took more time to do it. I do not understand this practice, but it makes the experience very enslaving and kills the perks of the MOOC. This is not what MOOCs are for. Otherwise I would go to a university and do the course there. Of course, my mistake was not to confirm it before. And I decided to give it a try nonetheless. But the final result is very negative. So despite the quality of the course, the exams (I enjoyed them! They are very practical) and the superb English of the teacher, I had to rate this course badly. Because every single time I had to do the homework it was a constant struggle to keep on doing it and I was really close to quit it. Because I insist, I did not enjoy it because of its structure and particularly because of the damn weekly assignments that had to be corrected by the students every single week. This is why, unfortunately, I will rate it this way: 2/5. I shall give a try to the next course, but if it is as tedious as this one (exams + weekly assignment every week), then I will quit both the course and the specialization... and I will recommend my friends and colleagues to NOT do this specialization.

9397711~COURSE!~rTTFFgb8EeWJMSIAC7Jl0w,1504088108074,2,0,"I work in Scientific Research field, were I use this knowledge every day and I know all the given information, just need a course certificate.So my experience:This course is truly well organized, it is full of information and has everything you should know about the topic. I loved funny examples, which are used continuously through the course and help to understand material very well.However, I had an unpleasant experience with assignments (so it is not a problem to receive knowledge, but problem to receive a certificate). The first problem is time. Assignments are extreme time consuming. They basically consist of scientific articles peer reviews. For example, it said, that you should spend 2 hours on this task. However, to review 1 article you need to read it at least 2 times, then think, then take notes, then read again. And if you don`t know all the material and criteria – you need to go and watch or read lecture material again and then read the article one more time. I knew all the review criteria, I do it on my work, so I did not need to read lecture material more than 1 time, but I spent about 10 hours to complete 1 assignment (and you need to do 6 of them). Next problem with assignments – I found my work (my assignment) to be stolen for 2 times!!!! It is a very hard and time-consuming work and I was terrified to find my work copy pasted by other student! This is a nightmare for a person, who worked so hard! So now I also need to worry about receiving bad grades from students, who will find 2 similar works. And this article review is a very hard task if you don`t have any experience, so I found other students like 70% failing this task. This is not like me judging too strictly - students just can not fulfil all the requirements. Like they write only 2 points instead of 10.  Maybe this is the cause why they still my work?About peer reviewing – this is not my first course on Coursera and I know, that 5 peer reviews to complete the assignment is a lot (usually 3 is enough). The course is not very popular so I am already waiting about month to be able to review 5 assignments from other students. When I go in to review I receive the note – sorry, no works available right now. I am not sure if I will finish this course with such course organization ☹. So I am not really happy with the course assignments and not sure if I will be able to receive the certificate, but I would recommend it to person, who seeks for knowledge not for certificate. AND the last assignment is simply horror! I see it for a first time in my experience on Coursera!! You have only 1 attempt in a MONTH! and 30 difficult questions about actual research. If you don`t pass it - you can retake it only after a month, basically, when you have forgotten the half of material! And bonus - you will not see your mistakes as you usually do on Coursera so no cheating and coping your answers is possible.",0,36,Ludmila Sinica,9397711

Personally I truly enjoyed the course . I´ve done a couple
of these course since I finished my masters, and this course has been the one
that has demanded me to study the most. On the other hand, the fact that it has
weekly written assignments were you have to analyze other texts specially
selected helps you develop the abilities you´re acquiring and apply the knowledge
the class provides. This is a very complete course that approaches an
university environment and demands a higher level of commitment that the
average coursera courses I´ve taken and if you´re like me it actually shows you
how rusty you´re at  study.

Annemarie Zand Scholten and UvA. The animations and transcripts of the course are just amazing.  我太喜欢这门课了！我是一个法学生，我觉得想要真正学好法律这门社会科学，仅仅是读法条、看课本、写论文，是不够的。我觉得，法学生还要学习如何自己进行（社会）研究，同时学会如何检验他人的研究。这挺重要的，因为通过这种方式，我们才能可能提出更可靠的假说，去改善我们的法律制度（例如，预防犯罪）。 非常感谢Annemarie Zand Scholten教授和阿姆斯特丹大学。这门课的动画和逐字稿真的做得非常棒。墙裂安利。",0,1,Yibo Li,47832046

Is a researcher withdrawing his work from being published a publication bias effect or a file-drawer effect. The effect that the publisher is not taking such papers is correct, and that the researcher is putting it away is correct. In this and several others I find the question does not narrow it down sufficiently or that both answers are technically correct. Others questions were really good, just hard and you had to find a subtle difference that were still differences. I also find questions like ""what most scientist would agree"" to be troublesome. I still learned so much I give five stars even though I see potential for growth. I would not have given a six out of six.",0,0,Sveinbjørn Jonsson,42579478

Because many people might avoid the course thinking it will deal with mathematics and date work. Similarly, many people might join thinking they will learn specifically those mentioned above, such as me. While I didn't learn what I was expecting, such as statistical analysis, using spss, stata, R etc. it was a pleasant discovery and I learnt so many new things. The proof is I have finished the 8 week course in less than a month, for sure. I would have done even faster, but at later stages, controlled myself as the course was getting over. And the instruction by Madam was so wonderful, I felt like it's happening live, not pre-recorded.  And the practical work, which requires reading, made it even worthwhile.

I was pleased to see it was running again.I've followed many many many Courseras and this is by far the highest quality. Well done!What you did right?Illustrations. They perfectly capture the concept without distracting. They are amusing and just-the-right-degree-of-imperfect, which makes the course material feel approachable.The graphic design. The slightly messy, hand-written, crumpled paper background design is perfect. Not pretentious, not overly boring. Just that little touch of individualism and authenticity we need. This is a great way to avoid alienating your students, to keep a connection.Philosophy of science, history of science, research designs, etc. Despite having studied for a BSc, an MSc, and a scientific postgrad, I had to find out about these concepts through on-line courses and podcasts. I was really happy to see these neatly presented to me in a structured way in one spot in the context of a formalResearch methods course. When covering these sections, you also did a great job at sticking to the important stuff. I am extremely impressed. In the reality of research, we get sucked in by the nitty gritty and forget about the big picture. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful framework behind the scientific method.You actually bothered spell-checking the transcript, particularly for proper names. I've had Courseras where the transcript seemed more like a onomatopeas than serious text.This is all I remember for now, all that's fresh off my mind, as am just up to week 2 right now, but I wanted to give you all a thumbs up for this great course you've wrapped up.
