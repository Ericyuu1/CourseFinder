The course is indeed intense so having this limitation does not improve the level. (2) practical assignments are hard to understand, no feedback is given, and sometimes I have the feeling that the instructions were cut out from some other larger more understandable assignment, maybe at Standford. It is sometimes very frustrating to do them without a clear connection to lectures or a clear understanding of what is being asked to do.

I wish that the Discussion Boards were more active, and it's a shame that the Mentors were Missing In Action.  On the one hand, the programming instructions were sometimes a bit vague, which made the assignments less like assignments are more like research projects.  For these 2 reasons, the course is 4-star rather than 5-star.  Still, it's a lot better than trying to learn this out of the book by oneself.  Some say enrollment has dropped off since they began charging for getting access to Quizzes and Programming Assignments.
