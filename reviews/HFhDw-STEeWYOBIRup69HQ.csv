I've experience in gcp for a couple of years and finish the CCC without any issue. But I often found myself somehow lost in this course. M​aterial is TOO OLD. Given how fast developing cloud is, you never want to review something which was made in 2016. Any video you can find on youtube will give you a better picture of those cloud product than this one. A​nd also there are mistasks. For example, in the chapter of kubenetes, professor even do not know ""kubectl"". He thought it was an ""i"" instead of 'l'! Well you can argue that in 2016 k8s is new but not correcting them in a course is unforgivable. A​fter finishing this course. I found quite lost. Do not take it if you want to have a taste on cloud.

The subjects are treated very superficially and the presentation style is confusing. I recommend to other students to read the Wikipedia articles about the subjects instead. Several times it feels like Mr. Campbell has never before seen the slides he is reading from and he is simply inventing stuff. Some information presented is plain wrong. Also, there is repeated talk of practical exercises to come, but that never happens. To Mr. Campbell's presentations, I would only award ONE STAR.  On the other hand I really liked the presentations from Mr. Farivar. He obviously knows what he is talking about and presents the material in a clear and understandable way. He should take over the whole course and let Mr. Campbell do some research back in his office. I would award 4.5 STARS to Mr. Farivar.  The homeworks of this course are simply checking for a very basic understanding of the topics. E.g. ""To do this and that, would you use technology A, B, or C?""
