30502367~COURSE!~bfnQqUbbEeeMtBKozo_2UA,1639887558573,2,0,"Course content was good but found the format and organization difficult.  I don't know if organization came from the instructor or if this is Coursa's format (this was my 1st and perhaps last coursea course).  The videos were excellent.  Journey mapping video of ""getting reading to get everyone out the door in the morning"" was great practical example that I wanted to use on my practical projects, but the presenter's  stakeholder list focused more on bottle necks and included only a few who facilited the project--the key stakeholders.I had difficulty following subtitles and terms--weeks vs parts, steps vs processes, etc.  Terms were often inconnsistently used.  It would have been helpful to have the basic curved idon/graph ""Steps in the Design Thinking Tool Kit""  (the 4 steps) printed on each page and on each video.  In a perfect world, most learners would follow your recommendation not to allow days before picking up the next module, but my schdulel does not allow for this.  There was no mention of a final assignment until the course end.  Was expecting to only answer the quizzzes.  This resulted in not being able to schedule time to complete the 2-part written assignment.  I submitted my written assignment a day ahead of the deadline, but I could not complete the 2nd surprise assignement (peer review) because there were none submitted.  Clearly others were surprised as well.  This assignement should be clearly state upfront.  I had alot of trouble finding things:  examples-- instructions on how to get things done, how to get into discussion forum.  For example, it took forever and a desperate phone call to my Dell IT team to find how to submit the final assignment--there was no link, no tab or instructions on the assignment page.  Nothing.  Clearly the course is not intuituve nor user-friendly-- the very subject matter of the course.  There is no chat.  No one to call--no customer service especially for 1st time users.  Based on thsi first experience, it is doubtful that I will enroll in another course.  I would just like to get this one completed and my certification which has become a hassle.  Getting this is critical to my current job search.  If you have suggestions or questions, please call Ruth at 703-527-0790.",0,0,Ruth De Hart,30502367

Naturally, the two courses have many things in common and even incorporate more or less the same video on storytelling by Andre Martin.It must be noted that a number of the examples appear to have had the ""design thinking"" label applied to them retroactively, which is to say that design thinking is not especially new as a set of principles or as a process. Moreover, while I appreciate Prof. Liedtka's assertion that design thinking is not a one-size-fits-all solution, I would have liked to have learned of instances when design thinking failed to lead to sustainable solutions. The social sector is as enamored of innovation as the business sector, but the fact is that overly fixating on making things new can mean passing up opportunities to make things better. I would also have liked Prof. Liedtka to acknowledge criticism of the actors in the social sector that she cites, such as MasAgro.Each week concludes with an auto-graded assessment, and there is also one peer-graded assignment to cap everything off. While I found the assignment a valuable exercise, it was also obvious that many of peers did not feel the same way, considering that I came across two submissions with plagiarized content.",0,0,Jaime Salazar,812087
