However, what really let this course down was the homework. The questions provided had little to no answer solutions which made it difficult for me to understand if I was making mistakes or not.

I did my BS and MS in biomedical engineering and never took an official ""statics"" class, and I've always wanted a better understanding of more complex systems than the stereotypical person on a diving board.

Overall, I am happy with this course, but there definitely can be improvements. However, the course could have used more example problems as home-work problems. Having enough worked out examples is a must to grasp any concept in Engineering or Physics. Fortunately, I studied this course with the help of Hibbeler's book on Statics, so there was no shortage of worked out  examples. I didn't make use of the textbook suggested by the lecturer, though that too might have been sufficient. But it still would have been nice to have these examples worked into the weekly lectures and problem sets.Also, I am not a great fan of the cool-off period of one week after trying the quiz once. This simply made me more hesitant  to take the quiz for the fear of ruining my shot, and delayed my clearing the course.
