The main challenge I had was with the approach that the Organization is a unified entity with a clear mission and objectives.

This offering comprehensively provides (1) a leadership toolkit to help prepare for, cope with, and mitigate crisis scenarios and environments and (2) the reasons to invest time and resources for such endeavors. I still do not see myself as a leader in most cases, let alone one that can step up during high-stakes episodes for organizations I am affiliated with. Nevertheless, I now have a clearer view of what to expect from those who will lead and, perhaps, how to contribute to such leadership efforts. Drawing from the experience and expertise of the course instructor, great emphasis is given to best practices for stakeholder understanding & engagement (and a practical definition for ‚Äústakeholder‚Äù), promoting and developing organizational resilience, the ‚Äúanatomy‚Äù and diversity of crisis environments and the responses they elicit, and the ‚Äúblueprint‚Äù of effective crisis leaders.
