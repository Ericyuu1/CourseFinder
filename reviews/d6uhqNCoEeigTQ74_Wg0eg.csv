53328326~COURSE!~d6uhqNCoEeigTQ74_Wg0eg,1595990257907,1,0,"I was really looking forward to this class, and this was the first class in the UX specialization that I was very disappointed in because of the teacher. It is absolutely inexcusable in 2020 to use a curriculum that is ONLY referencing male cultural producers. Every single example he used of a designer, every author,  every inspirational quote, every filmmaker, every artist he referenced  were MALE. Every. Single. One. ZERO females were mentioned in his  entire curriculum except once when he acknowledged that a user could be a ""she."" The quiz questions were poorly worded and didn't test concept knowledge. There were many examples of quiz wording errors. I liked how he let us choose our own project to prototype. We had to create an online application, which is great too, but for the final Interaction Design capstone project, he had us design tedious paper prototypes even after teaching us that the main purpose of paper prototypes is for non-digital products! I think he severely underestimated his students and should have created a useful assignment like an interactive digital prototype using InVision or Balsalmiq - things we would use in the real world. Please update your curriculum University of Michigan! ",0,15,Jody Wood,53328326
60560039~COURSE!~d6uhqNCoEeigTQ74_Wg0eg,1590746388214,3,0,"Would have given 5 stars if not for one factor - the peer graded assignments. All of us seem to be new to this field, so it was hard to get insightful feedback. Also there were always delays from the time I received feedback from peers to the time I actually received my grade in the system. This was the SOLE reason I was not able to complete the course in my desired time frame. Other than that, the lectures were useful and well paced. ",0,6,Ian Yap,60560039

That being said, the assignments did not do justice to the teaching, there's no real understanding of what constitutes good design from just the peer-graded reviews alone. There's no real input in terms of feedback. Personally, I found the final assignment a bit redundant with the paper prototyping. Offering more technical alternatives like the previous assignments would have been useful - not because paper prototypes are outdated, but because it's hard to implement in a non-lab setting.
