90858510~COURSE!~MrT4mUJbEeuVrwrlQzvd6w,1646407073760,3,0,Cons: This course is really great but there are a lot of things lacking. There are few issues for example most of the time the assignments has typo and wrong answers. I recomment to look into forum when doing assignment. From week 2 there will be a lot of mistakes in assignments. The forum is very passive and that's one issue that instructor should improve. There are  so many mistakes in homework that it should be given free.Pros: I like the instructor does some creative experiments I LOVE it( He seems to be very passionate about it). The books are great resource and I recommend to read it and take notes. The quality of teaching is above average and very beginner friendly.   When the homework will be fixed I will rate 5 stars :). Thanks for creating the course.,0,2,Chase 0_o,90858510
