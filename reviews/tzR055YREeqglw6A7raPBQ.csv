94387955~COURSE!~tzR055YREeqglw6A7raPBQ,1640024509671,1,0,"Although this seems like its a nice course, unfortunately, you really cannot audit the content. You have to upgrade to even really start week 2. I appreciate the work the content creator put forth, but compared to other comparable products/topics, this one doesn't offer to much. For example, I can get a full course from Udemy for $59.00 one-time fee, that is much more in-depth,  or I can get this one by paying $49.00 a month. Additionally, it seems that alot of the courses on coursera offer more content and do not lock it as ""honors"" content.  So unfortunately, I will disenroll, an start another biology course most likely on Udemy, unless I find one I like on Coursera.",0,0,Nakisha Nicole,94387955
58431997~COURSE!~tzR055YREeqglw6A7raPBQ,1622746014349,1,0,"This course promises it is an introductory biology course. It is not. It will be helpful if you are in middle grade or if you are taking classes at University of Colorado Boulder. the content is very dull and basic. The professor makes the clases slow and not engaging. This course discouraged me from taking the full specialization because the content is so easy and unprepared. You waste a lot of time reviewing other's peer assignment and these assignments are not challenging but have questions like ""Answer what is science and what are the dangers of people not knowing science"". Don't waste your time on this course. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS IF YOUR GOAL IS TO LEARN BIOLOGY.",0,3,Paula Mariana  Ruiz Constante,58431997

111491864~COURSE!~tzR055YREeqglw6A7raPBQ,1677125401368,2,0,"I was excited about the content of this course and specialization but ended up disappointed. There isn't much science content in it, and the focus on what science is and isn't feels repetitive and too basic. Additionally, Dr. Peffer speaks so quickly that it's hard to understand what she's saying. I think in addition to speaking slower, a focus on a slideshow presentation, rather than the speaker, would help so that keywords could be visible. Lastly, while a lot of classes have a single peer-reviewed assignment at the end, this class uses so many peer-reviewed assignments that it's slow to get feedback and complete the class. And because a lot of the peer-reviewed assignments require a perfect score, if one person takes a point off, you'll have to resubmit. (And like every class, there are peer reviewers who will just give zeros for no reason, so again you have to resubmit once it's been graded.) The honors track takes even longer to get legitimate scores, and I'm still waiting on that to be completed.I love being able to access free classes, and I appreciate that this course is a MOOC offered to the public at no charge, so I give the professor credit for sharing this. However, I think it could be improved for a better educational experience.",0,0,Danielle Bauman-Epstein,111491864

56540227~COURSE!~tzR055YREeqglw6A7raPBQ,1604167627851,3,0,"Definitely not what I expected. It was announced as a course to 'explore the nature of science and biology, to discuss what science and biology are as disciplines of inquiry and how chemistry is foundational to understanding biology'. I basically expected an innovative way yo teach and stimulate interest in 'biology for non-biology students'. Well, the biological content of this first four weeks of course reduces to five criteria to define life (homeostasis, organization, energy use, reproduction, evolution), introduced in 9 minutes in week 3. The chemical basis (week 4)  is a reminder that 'chemicals' are not synonym of 'bad things' and a 5 minutes introduction to four classes of biological macromolecules (carbs, proteins, nucleid acids, fats). The rest is mostly a report on the teacher's experience with 'common misconceptions on science and the scientific method'. If  you have a high-school basis in biology (or even less than that...), you learn nothing. If not, the course provides little more than a few names and examples that, in the bast case, give the illusion of understanding rather than true understanding. The ratio of peer-reviews assignments to quizzes is too high and does not assure that you learn the notions, it's a case of blind leading the blind. Maybe things change with the following courses, but I hesitate to take them, I found this one too boring and basic.  Perhaps it is mostly useful for teachers when covering the 'common misconception' aspects; it also has a honours track that seems almost exclusively targeted to educators (not at college/university, though!), since you need to devise pedagogical strategies and the like. If you are paying for this course, think twice and be sure that it's what you're looking for. ",0,3,Pasquale Dario Serpico,56540227

What I did not enjoy is the lack of feedback I received from my peer-reviewed assignments ... the grades they gave me felt arbitrary without any kind of comments to put them in context. As an example, I received a .5 score on my first assignment (an average of a 1 and 0 rating), which I felt was absurd.
