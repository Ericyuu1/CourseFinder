loved the course and its contents, teachers, videos and resources. It
helped me to consolidate my thoughts about disability and the need of a real inclusion.
This course covered a wide range of relevant issues and gave us a good background
and starting point to work with. Dealing with a person with disability is challenging,
demanding and might be frightening, but its also a great opportunity for personal
growth and self-development. Inclusion is the best and only way to approach disability
and it is crucial not only to protect and take care of the most vulnerable with
disability, but also to change other people´s minds and hearts. An inclusive
society that embraces diversity is a better society for all its members. As
an Educational Psychologist and mother of a 3-year-old daughter with DS I feel

This made learning so much easier for me! The only thing I found stressful/ challenging, was the peer-graded assignments. I completed this course as part of a requirement for my University of Johannesburg online module and those have different due dates for the course which means peer-graded assignments became stressful and caused mass anxiety. I think there should maybe be an option of a differentiated assignment to elevate that pressure/stress. I am so glad I have found Coursera, I will definitely be completing more in the future!
