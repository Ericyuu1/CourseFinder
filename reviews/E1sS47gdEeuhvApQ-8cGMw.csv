20587416~COURSE!~E1sS47gdEeuhvApQ-8cGMw,1634539469611,5,0,"While I knew most of materials of the course prior to taking it and it was relatively easy for me to pass all the assignments, I strongly recommend the course if you want to understand the main concepts of mathematical finance. It is very well balanced course, not overly difficult but not easy either. Optimal duration and size of the information for you to learn and understand. While, I barely used videos and mostly used slides, I find that Professor explains core concepts very nicely. This is one of the best courses I took on Coursera!",0,0,Sergey Milikisiyants,20587416
