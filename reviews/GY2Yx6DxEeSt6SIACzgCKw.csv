I don't deny the lecturer's knowledge of the material, but he does a horrible job of getting the points across. His voice is more monotone than the sound of pressing a single key on a keyboard. I've had an interest in nanotechnology for quite some time, but this course did not invoke it at all. The structure of the overall course is also quite problematic. 70% of your grade depends on 2 assignments that are graded by other people taking this course. On top of that, you have no guarantee that these people have any knowledge regarding the course since people who fail the weekly checkpoints are still given permission to grade your papers.Furthermore, for the quizzes that make up the remaining 30%, you have to look up the answers to half the questions since the lecturer doesn't cover a lot of topics in his slideshow. Also many of the questions aren't in the correct week quizzes. For example, in week 3, the quiz questions were on material from week 4. Personally, I don't mind it but if you can't stand thick accents and mispronunciations, don't take this course.Hope this review helps :)",0,1,Abhiram Devata,42496867

Unfortunately I got evaluated by two instead of three referees, which means one person can block you completely to pass. Additionally you need to have 80% (32 points), which also means if they give you 3 points in all categories you're not gonna pass. This is not well thought at all.In particular if I only get comments from the referees like ""good"" or ""nicely written"".So I got 60% in the end and should redo the mini project?

I've falling asleep here with him reading off the slides in an incongruent manner (not to mention an accent for those who may be foreign to English).  Some others have complained about the same. He simply reads off the slides with no explaining, no further examples, no reiteration or analogies, the slides do not always follow his messages either (which may be cool, more info the better, but some concepts are difficult that are just spoken over). It's a very interesting subject matter but even though it's quite early I'm confident that this course will NOT help me in the future and will do as much good as some lengthy Google searches. I haven't gotten that far, but many complain about the chaotic marking scheme as well [don't expect your certificate so soon]... Would Not Recommend. (MSc student opinion) ",0,10,Matt Ball,24703392

46913061~COURSE!~GY2Yx6DxEeSt6SIACzgCKw,1588826753647,2,0,"1. NO peer-reviewed / group assignmentsIf, in theory, the intention is to create a community, this is not the way to do it. First of all, each student joins on their own schedule, which makes the timing quite unreliable. Second, this is NOT a university setting--how would I be confident that anyone grading my work has any inkling of what they are doing? Same goes for vice versa. Even in a university setting, people within the SAME cohort would operate at different levels. Surely, this sort of collaboration is impossible in a MOOC, open-access format with zero prerequisite qualifications......2. Hire an actorIf the current lecturer is simply reading off a script with zero engagement with the slides, surely it would've been more effective to find someone with a clearer articulation of English. There are certain words that are not pronounced properly, and the frequent pauses in the middle of sentences is incredibly difficult to follow. Yes, I have turned on subtitles. It is also pointless to show a video of the speaker, since he does nothing; no eye contact, no hand gestures, absolutely nothing.3. Provide slide resourcesIt would be more effective if the slides used during the videos were available as a PDF download. Especially as the pass grade for the quizzes are so high, it would enable better study material; or even to reference specific areas in the textbook to review.4. Quiz reviewFor your reference, I have received 100% on my quiz grades. But there are still problems with them, for example, in this Week 1 thread; some information must be searched outside of the course. If this NOT intentional, you should review your own lecture material, that it is not sufficient. What is especially not helpful, are passive-aggressive mentor replies that does not assist the initial issue any way possible.I have also noticed for Week 3, the quiz is much more easily accomplished by reviewing the eBook, and NOT the lectures... because the content actually exists in Week 4 lectures!5. Quiz bugsAfter completing the quizzes, the answer content disappears so viewing feedback is impossible. Only the question and score is visible. Somehow, the week 5 quiz is functioning normally, as expected.SUMMARYThere is interesting content, most especially, the featured videos within the lectures. However, the methodology used to transmit material to us, the students, is simply not effective. This feels quite disorganised. I would go elsewhere to learn.",0,6,mp,46913061

Most of the video lectures were the prof reading directly from the text book.  I found it easier to learn the content by reading by myself.  The frequent mispronunciation of many of the words by the presenter was very distracting.  It was only the occasional embedded video that supplemented the printed material that was worth watching, and even some of that was questionable as to its merit.  I also found that some of the quiz questions were from sections of the text that were covered in subsequent videos.  In addition, the wording of some of the questions made no sense.  It would be a good idea to have someone familiar with this material proof read the quizzes.  [I would be happy to perform this task in return for credit to apply towards course certificates.]It was unclear exactly how to submit the written projects.   I don't think the ""attached file method"" was functional, and had to cut and paste the text into one of the text boxes before it would appear in the submitted content for review.   (and which of the two should it go in?) The first student review that I performed was also lost so I had to do four of them before I could see my marks.Lastly, the written projects were poorly done.  The last one in particular seemed to be more of a gleaning of ideas from the students for future development by the prof.  The topic was more IoT and less nanotechnology and Nano sensors.
