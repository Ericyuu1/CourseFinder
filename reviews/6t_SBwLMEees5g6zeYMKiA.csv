It presents the transgender issue as one that is unquestionable, to be faced with full submission by healthcare and education professionals, and all of society really. No other approaches other than the affirmative one are explored. The videos are extremely sentimental, treating very serious matters as if they were something superfluous if faced with approval, but outraging if rejected. Bringing queer medics to talk on behalf of gender transition doesn't solve an issue that is affecting increasing numbers of children. This is just wrong on so many levels.

The course did not do a very good job of talking about Health Across the Gender Spectrum!  The focus was entirely on social issues, not physical health concerns (such as expressing sexuality, cancer risks associated with hormone therapy, etc.) and an inadequate amount on mental health concerns (it was mentioned that there are higher rates of depression, anxiety, drug abuse, and suicide among transgender individuals, but not much was said about dealing with these issues apart from finding a support group.  NOTHING WHATSOEVER was said about violence against transgender individuals, such as the appallingly high murder rate of Black transgender women.

My biggest issue with this course is separating sex and gender from each other and calling trans people, ""biologically a girl, but view themselves as a boy"" (and things along those lines). That just creates a way for transphobic people to further misgender and hurt trans people; they see that as a loop-hole to be disrespectful. Another issue I had was the lack of discussions about nonbinary people; I wish we were more included because we have unique problems that do align with trans people (and a lot of us identify as both transgender AND nonbinary), so it's a big disservice to have is practically excluded from the discussion. I also had a problem with a lot of the professionals who were speaking; most were cisgender people and I wished we could hear our own voices and expertise on this subject rather than having cis people teaching all about it. I also think there was too much focus on parents' perspectives on things, which were almost always transphobic (""I had a boy but now they're a girl and I miss that boy"" or something along those lines). It takes away from the message that you're here for trans people when you have parents speaking in this way.

The honor code validation use of ""legal name"" on a course about transgender rights/health poses a particular emotional barrier for transgender people taking the course.

I find sometimes adolescents expect they have to teach us, the older generations or wear their gender identification on their sleeve. I feel sad that they sometimes look for us to fail. However, they are adolescents and they have everyright to flex their identity muscle when needed. We need to be more gracious and actually be wise, not letting our ego be offended.
