466962~COURSE!~5YyD2_i5Eem8UhJ_twURkg,1603183179506,1,0,"This course is not much more than a collection of slides, narration, references to external videos, and multiple choice tests. There are no graded labs, there is no need to write actual code.Perhaps it is enough to provide some level of overview, but there are no hard skills to be learnt here. Overall this course offers much less than the majority of technical courses I find on Coursera.",0,0,Zoltán Bődi,466962

30399438~COURSE!~5YyD2_i5Eem8UhJ_twURkg,1596320093987,1,0,Almost got through the first week but I found that the instructions for the labs were difficult to follow and didn't really explain what you were doing or why you were doing it. I'm canceling because I have spent more time trying to figure out what the cryptic instructions are saying than actually doing the work.,0,1,Will Davis,30399438

70471850~COURSE!~5YyD2_i5Eem8UhJ_twURkg,1603460715627,2,0,"There was some really useful information in this course and I've definitely come out of it with a broadly better understanding of ETL, ELT, Data Streaming and the various tools available on Azure for performing these tasks. HOWEVER, there were a few issues. A lot of the videos seem to have been edited quite badly, and topics and slides were being presented out of order, or with no context given first. For example, one of the videos was a detailed explanation of how to manage log files in a Spark data cluster, but there had never been any mention or introduction  before this about what Spark actually is. Also, the ""Labs"" were completely useless. Most labs only contained the basic steps for setting up certain resources on azure. At one point I followed a lab, assumed it would be picked up again in the next lab, and ended up incurring a pretty high azure bill for leaving that resource up and running....this course has basically no ""hands on"" learning.I would probably not recommend anybody to pay money for this course, although I did enjoy module 6 on Azure Data Analytics.",0,0,Katie,70471850

Besides a tiny chapter, it does not cover Databricks and how to really make use of it. The instructor seems like a text to speech reading the material. All in all, I could get a good sense on how Data Factory works and with more work I can apply it in production to make some pipelines better.",0,0,Icaro da Costa Bombonato,31558
