68666562~COURSE!~LqzAgMcqEeyduw6ktL3Xvw,1673842635771,5,0,"This is a great way to close the specialization, managing state in React is fun to work with once you learn it well, and the course does a good job of teaching you all the concepts and heuristics you need to put together an app. The only issue is that there are quite a few things left for the student to figure out, which I enjoyed, but sometimes the course could provide more specific info. about requirements and reduce the scope to a specific section. Specifically designing and wireframing navigation for pages that we don't get to implement, some details of the Formik implementation don't match the docs (using the formik object instead of components), and some React Router and testing hiccups. The solutions we find by ourselves can make the app work but then we end up refactoring to meet the final requirements that get blurry along the way because of so much troubleshooting. I guess it's trains you well for real life.",0,1,Alberto Valdez Quinto,68666562
2659123~COURSE!~LqzAgMcqEeyduw6ktL3Xvw,1673312150155,5,0,"That was a great way to implement all the knowledge we got during previous courses.  It was a real challenge for the learning mind.  There were a lot of details to implement.  
And I believe it was the best way to refresh all this material in our memory.
This homework is the real moment when I actively learn. Watching videos is passive learning and it's not as effective as active learning. 
Thank you for a great course. It was a pleasure to study with Meta.",0,0,Artem Goncharenko,2659123
