It's always ""don't worry if you don't understand that, it doesn' matter"". Well, actually if it's only to learn basic stuff I don't need coursera...3) In several videos, the instructor just records himself coding with spark for several minutes. How boring ! At what point do you think this kind of video is of any interest for your student ? What are the practice lab for ?4) The quizz are annoying ! Not that they are ""easy"" but most of the answer of the questions are either ambiguous or not related to the course and must be found elsewhere5) The final quizz is a joke and you just have to run a notebook and then copy/past the answer. Even there, some question are ambiguous : you are asked to change a model and then ""compare the models"", but which one ? The one we changed or the initial one ? And so one.In conclusion, I learn some things and practice a bit apache spark with this course, but 90% of what I learned come from other sources than coursera...

I wished they would make the course more challenging, so that we would learn more. For people considering the IBM AI engineering specialization and this course, I would say that it is a very good introduction. For those looking for a more in-depth approach to ML and DL, then this course isn't going to hit those areas. Regarding this course specifically, they did a good job explaining the concepts well. I would have preferred if they made the course proejct a lot less hand holding. They essentially give you the jupyter notebook with all the ETL procedures done, and you change like 4 variables, which isn't really intellectually stimulating or challenging. I understand that the course is meant to be an introduction, but I think asking us to do the ETL by ourselves with less rail guards would teach the students a lot more. Like I would say I learned more about Apache Spark and functional programming from the 2nd module quiz than the course project, because the quiz had us writing the code ourselves, and I had to learn and debug functions on my own.
