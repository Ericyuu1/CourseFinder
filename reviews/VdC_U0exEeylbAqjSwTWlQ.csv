112510511~COURSE!~VdC_U0exEeylbAqjSwTWlQ,1669105025212,5,0,"Dr. Tollette's course is a must on DEIB. Her approach is not only systematic, exemplified, and accessible, but it is nuanced and avoids the usual pitfalls of shallow DEI knowledge. I really recommend anyone wanting to get a stimulating and anchoring overview of what DEIB is and how to do it right in organizations to take her course!",0,0,Bérénice Kafui Schramm,112510511
