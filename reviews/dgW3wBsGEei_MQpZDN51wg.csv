107620373~COURSE!~dgW3wBsGEei_MQpZDN51wg,1653799835997,2,0,"I​'m a retired college instructor (professional writing); hold a master's degree and a paralegal certificate. I found the course almost incomprehensible from the start. The lecturer seems to make a lot of assumptions about his audience's knowledge of legal vocabulary and definitions. He puts up a slide with a phrase, then talks at length about issues related to that phrase, but not in a way that defines or illuminates them. Seems not to be familiar with the basic professional use of PowerPoint in introducing concepts. One of the essential readings links is broken. 

I thought perhaps it was me, but have since started ""An Introduction to American Law"" from the University of Pennsylvania on Coursera, and it's night and day. Terms and vocabulary clearly defined at the outset; course concepts ditto; an abundance of helpful additional readings to help students understand.

Two stars only because I know the lecturer is an expert on his topic, but it doesn't seem any effort has gone into making this accessible for students at what's listed as a ""beginning"" level. There is a stark difference between talking about a subject and teaching a subject.

Second, the video lectures clearly explain judicial decisions and the reasoning behind them while sprinkling in 'pop quizzes' to reinforce what the student has learned.

62612655~COURSE!~dgW3wBsGEei_MQpZDN51wg,1592056929694,5,0,"One of the most helpful legal instruments I’ve learned from this course is that although many of us for practical purposes would not read all the terms and conditions on most websites or online transactions, a legally useful and time-saving way to gauge the credibility of a site which is bound under the U.S. jurisdiction is to observe how transparently its terms and conditions are displayed. According to an American common law provision recorded in clause 211(c) of the Restatement (Second) of Contracts (1979), if one party designs/displays a term in such a way they know that the other party will be unlikely to read in full, that term will not be enforceable. A further insightful idea to constrain the abuse of customers’ trust of the reasonability of online terms and agreements as well as their limited time resources has been proposed by Professor Ayres  and Professor Schwartz in their law-review article ‘The No-Reading Problem in Consumer Contract Law’ in 2014 (available at http://www.stanfordlawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/03/66_Stan_L_Rev_545_AyresSchwartz.pdf).  In short, they proposed the requirements for online sites to add a warning box containing the most unexpected and unfavorable terms in their contractual offer, basing their argument on the presumption that most consumers would have been familiar with other standard terms in the market they are engaging with. Some natural questions I could think of would be 1. How to quantitatively determine the benchmark on which term(s) being ‘unexpected’ and ‘unfavorable’ enough so that they are legally required to be in those warning boxes? In other words, how to determine the minimum required terms in such boxes? 2. Should there be an upper limit of how many terms could be contained in those warning boxes? (to prevent bad-faith sites from saturating all those boxes with unnecessary terms to overwhelm customers but still nominally meet the requirement)3. As new forms of services and products are coming up online fast and faster, if quantitative limits could ever be set for question 1 and 2, how are those standards going to be adapted to new markets/new industries? (This question may be particularly relevant if the initiative is to be extended to civil-law jurisdictions which may not enjoy the benefit of constantly-evolving case laws like the American judicial tradition.)Any inputs or constructive criticism would be more than appreciated!",0,0,Tin Trung Nguyen,62612655
