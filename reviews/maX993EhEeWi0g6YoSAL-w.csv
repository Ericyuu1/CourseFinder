Programming assignment requires you to repeat the steps shown on the video without problem statement except for the 1st assignment. Even if you complete your assignment the auto grader  will not give you full marks after meeting all the requirements as shown in the video. For the 2nd assignment - if you follow the video steps you will never pass the assignment. In the video there is foreign key relationship between User and Post as well as User and Comment Class.But the auto grader fails you because of foreign key enforcement in the schema, only after removing the foreign key enforcement which is opposite of the step shown on the video, you will clear the 2nd assignment.",0,0,Abhi D (AB),34202050

The students have found some hacks to work around the numerous issues, so it is possibly to at least jury-rig your work to pass the course. However, this will neither be instructive nor pretty nor fun. Don't do this to yourself.Many things are left unexplained, you will find yourself typing stuff without understanding anything about it. The instructors will tell you that it will be explained in a later course, but all later courses have been taken down.

9397711~COURSE!~maX993EhEeWi0g6YoSAL-w,1473274294458,2,0,"Unfortunately, didn`t enjoy this course at all. I have gone through 7 courses on Coursera and finished them with the biggest pleasure and great results. This time I had to leave the course before finishing because: 1st: content is organized awfully (for example ""HTML overview"" - I knew all the material so I have an idea how it should look like, but lecturer started from the middle of all concepts, than moved to the beginning and together it looked like an unlinked content. I have simply lost a logic inside this.2nd: Very difficult to get an idea: lecturer doesn`t try to simplify the content, even opposite - I had a feeling, that he makes easy things complicated for a reason. My husbend is a programmer with 10 years experience and when he watched the lecture he said, that even for him it was difficult to understand all the thing (things he actually knows). All these terms used, no relevant examples, too complex words and so on  - I lost concentration, I had to google a lot of unknown terms, I had to stop lecture every 30 seconds to reread or repeat the peace of lecture, because I could not understand it. As I mentioned, I know HTML well, but it was described so complex, that it was difficult to link my actual knowledge to lecturer words.3rd: not international student friendly. Use of complex words in places where they were not necessary, complex structures, too fast language... I am pretty good in English, but had to stop video and to google translate some ""smart"" words lecturer used without particular need - I don`t mean definitions, just some epithets to make his speech ""smarter"". I completed Coursera specialization by  Michigan University and it was completely easy with plain text, short sentences, so well made for international student. 4th: this is boring. I am sorry, but this is true. I am interested in all these questions, but for some reasons I lose my attention every time. Maybe the reason is in all points I have just mentioned, but I didn`t enjoy this course at all and it was the first time I didn`t enjoy something connected with web app development. Please, don`t be mad at me - lecturer is a very charming and charismatic person, but I simply don`t like how the material is presented. 5th: I have a feeling like all slides are taken from some scientific books and lecturer reads comments from some science articles, it is not like described with own words, simplified for better comprehension, cleared with own real-life examples and in atmosphere of friendly conversation with some emotions and humor. Please, take my feedback just as my personal opinion and hope other students will enjoy it more.",0,5,Ludmila Sinica,9397711

57289968~COURSE!~maX993EhEeWi0g6YoSAL-w,1593128885078,3,0,"Overall, I think this is a pretty solid course to get a good preliminary understand of how web apps work, and the sorts of services that support it. My main detractors are firstly, that while being an introductory course, does assume that the learner has some knowledge and background in development - if you don't have any background you may be a bit lost at times, or need to find supplementary information.Secondly, the course system hasn't aged all that well - at the time I took the course, the version of Ruby and Rails I was using was a few versions newer than that used in the course, which is ok for the most part, but the grading system won't issue a passing grade unless you do a few workarounds with the actual file submission, and it doesn't look to be getting much support from its creators.So overall, three starts for great knowledge, guided learnings and comprehensive coverage of materials, but only three because it makes some assumptions about its audience that I don't think are always true, and you must do some workaround in order pass all the submissions.",0,2,Calen Siddall,57289968
9153021~COURSE!~maX993EhEeWi0g6YoSAL-w,1466695102198,3,0,"This course has amazing breath.  Most other specializations are organized chronologically (i.e. Course 1: Learn Ruby, Course 2: learn about databases with rails, Course 3: Learn about HTML,CSS, JS, etc.)  But this introductory course describes everything that goes into making web applications, from front end to back end and compares ruby on rails to the other major frameworks.  If you're just trying to get started learning WebApps, as I was, this is very useful.    The reason I couldn't give it 5 stars was that there weren't very useful assignments.  You learn programming best from doing projects.  In this course, there were a few quizes (which aren't as nearly as useful as projects) and the only projects that existed were to simply follow the steps exactly as the professor did in his videos.   I think that the makers of the course are 90% of the way to a top course, they just need to add in programming assignments for each week, where you don't just follow the professor.  I learned a lot from this course, but without getting the programming projects and exercises needed to reinforce the understanding, it may be hard to retain some of the knowledge.
