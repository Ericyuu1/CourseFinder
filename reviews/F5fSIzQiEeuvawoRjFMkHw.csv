I had to constantly re-adjust the volume for low volume lessons, then got blasted by decibels when the next lesson immediately after that was already recorded at a high volume. Had to play this game of ""volume cat and mouse"" throughout the specialization and it detracted from some of my learning enjoyment.  Thank you! ",0,0,Kerry W.,66182056
