34474394~COURSE!~GGdJZCEZEeaFdg7FFZQVLw,1548397117500,5,0,"I thought this was an excellent course. I have been an ESL teacher for many years and really upgraded my skills with this course. In fact, I was rather shocked about how primitive my skills in this area were when I started doing the quizzes and assignments, but that was great because I was really learning and I immediately started putting the course's ideas and techniques into practice in my own classes (it will take me some time to improve but I am working on it!) I think many teachers believe a 'whole class discussion' means the teacher asking the class / individual students questions and then chatting away (at least that is what many of my colleagues over the years have seemed to be satisfied with). Getting a whole class to participate in a discussion, taking turns and keeping it going, needs far more and this course teaches you how to set up discussion norms, get students to respond to each others' points and conduct a discussion with fairly minimal teacher input / intervention eventually. Some of the videos of real, committed teachers in action were great to watch and an excellent benchmark. This is a very underrated skill in my view (hence many teachers may bypass the course) - I advise to give it a go if you are a new teacher or an experienced teacher who  wants to fine tune this area of your teaching: think, are your classes really having discussions?) and I hope there will be more in depth courses on this topic forthcoming.",0,5,Ian Fletcher,34474394
