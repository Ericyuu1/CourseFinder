96704870~COURSE!~HXsj6jeHEeWJaxK5AT4frw,1644065141096,1,0,"The MOOC overall is an exceptional crash-course into hotel distribution and revenue management but this particular course was, in comparison to the first course, way below par. Unlike the first course, this one is fully conducted by partner company Duetto. The lecture videos were hard to follow, as the information was overgeneralized and excruciatingly repetetive.  The practice quizzes consisted of basic multiple choice questions that, just like the videos, offered nearly zero practical application of the topics at hand. Additionally, the quizzes were riddled with typos--As were the video captions.The course is concluded with a final exam, which  at last challenges students to make strategic decisions based on numeric performance metrics in various hotel scenarios. Such questions and cases should have been presented throughout the course, so that the student could acquire a clearer understanding of hotel revenue management overall. Instead, you are bombarded with basic definitions and general key points. ",0,0,Hasan Hussain,96704870

Additionally, one presenter's overuse of gesture is particularly distracting.Links to a large portion of the supplementary materials provided are defunct. While some can still be found by searching online, others have been removed from public access by Duetto (i.e. from their website or their YouTube channel).Additionally, given almost all of the supplementary materials are from a single source which has a business interest in promoting certain approaches to revenue management, they provide a very one-sided view of how it should be done.The course assessment is not thorough - requiring just a single examination of only 15 questions, and which can be repeated multiple times.

The concepts can be presented in a biased form (by the sponsoring company), so take it with a grain of salt.  The content is outdated (links and videos don't work; no engagement on forums).  More details below.What it does well: It's well structured; it uses industry specific terminology and topics; it touches on some issues that hotel managers deal with and summarizes some of the solutions.Drawbacks: The university has partnered with different companies in the creation of this course, and the overall specialization.  The companies are selling their products in a very subtle way, so they present some of the concept in a way that aligns with their agenda.  As an example:  Course 1 (not associated with any firm) equally highlighted the pros and cons of working with OTAs, while Course 2, sponsored by Duetto, mostly spoke about the negatives of OTA bookings.95% of the articles don't exist anymore; 100% of the videos don't exist. There are too many typos in the practice tests, as well as the closed captions - unacceptable for a course published by a university.

There was not one question based on the knowledge on the exam that you learned like the quizzes.

Maybe some value for money, but you're not getting the best available product.I enjoyed the videos and I learned a lot. Duetto has great insights, especially if you're already somewhat familiar with RM and the industry. For students, however, there are not enough opportunities to apply the concepts during the course. The result is a set of problems on the Final Exam that represent the first real chance for the student to apply all of the theory of the course. More practice in application of concepts before the final exam is necessary. Give more exercises for practice instead of waiting until the Final to throw problems at students. An even bigger problem in the course was low quality writing and typing for Coursera materials. In the quizzes and in the closed-captioning, there were tons of typos. There was also text in the quizzes that I would bet was not proofread. Nobody proofed the in-course written materials. I'm sure I missed some quiz questions because of typos and text errors. There are two big textual errors on the Final Exam too, like someone decided to change the nature of the test question, but didn't delete all of the text from an earlier version of the question That happened to change the meaning of the question completely! And then the same weird error appeared again on the following question!As far as outside materials go, it was good, when I could find it! Nearly all of the readings were from the corporate partner Duetto, but there were many bad hyperlinks. When I was lucky, I found the reading or video on my own, but sometimes I could not. I realize that I'm taking a canned course that was created a few years ago, but I'm paying, and all links to outside readings should work. So there you have it. I learned a lot from the excellent videos by Nathaniel Green, who has since left Duetto. He does a great job of explaining Duetto's thinking about RM, which is pretty sophisticated. Looking back at when I first learned about RM 10 years ago, Duetto is leading RM thought exactly where it needs to go, to a place that understands big data and the explosion of channels.
