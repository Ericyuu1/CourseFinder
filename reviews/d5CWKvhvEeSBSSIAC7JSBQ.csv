99504131~COURSE!~d5CWKvhvEeSBSSIAC7JSBQ,1641065525006,3,0,"Title should be ""Algorithms for layout and timing in VLSI CAD"".  This course contains nothing that teaches you VLSI design or actual use of modern EDA tools.  It does present an interesting and clear explanation of basic algorithms, so if that is what you are looking for (either because you want to create such tools, or you like to know what is happening inside them) this is a recommended course, but if you are looking for how to work with VLSI CAD tools, this is not it.",0,0,Tanj Bennett,99504131
