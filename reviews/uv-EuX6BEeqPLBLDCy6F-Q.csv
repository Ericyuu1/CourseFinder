I don't want to be rude but I've seen way better videos on YouTube. Also the fact that they try to get money out of this by asking for paid upgrade before being able to do the test is annoying (if the would actually know how to use motivational techniques they would act diffently, just saying) - and that course is not at all worth 47$!

To everyone who really wants to learn something about MI don't waste your time on this one.",0,0,Daniel-Benjamin Moniz,114876885

It is important to note that the content of this course is basically a video-audio recording of a webinar (which was otherwise well-delivered). I hope that future incarnations of this course will provide a longer, comprehensive material, given the importance of motivational enhancement techniques within and beyond addiction treatment.
