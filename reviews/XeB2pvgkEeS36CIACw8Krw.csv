760302~COURSE!~XeB2pvgkEeS36CIACw8Krw,1463466756268,3,0,"This course is well worth a student's time and effort.  There are excellent presentations by the professor, but in it's current format the course is too short for the amount of technical knowledge implicit in the material.  In addition, the quizzes are poorly written.  Some questions are asked at the end of modules when the subject of the question is not even introduced until the following module.  Further, for some questions the right answer is either not given in the choices presented or the grading protocol doesn't recognize the correct answer.  Some questions ask what answer is ""most correct"" which implies that there is a strong element of subjective judgement involved in its formulation.  The student is allowed only one attempt at a quiz every 8 hours, where many other Coursera courses allow 3 attempts every 8 hours, which is more conducive learning and retaining the material due to the instant feedback. Finally, there are several ""NOT"" or 'opposite answer' questions which are valid but confusing, so the student must be careful when answering.Recommendations:  1. Add at least three more sessions to the class and spread the technical material out over more sessions.  2. Rewrite the quiz question set to clarify what you are asking, and make certain the material was covered in the module you are assessing.  3. Don't use 'what is the best answer' (""most correct"") type questions, they are ALL too subjective to be fair.  4. Recheck the grading protocol to make certain it is properly evaluating the answers.",0,0,Harry Foster,760302
