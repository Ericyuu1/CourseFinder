36707553~COURSE!~bNfKJYcIEemsaArI-0TJTA,1582311778396,3,0,"This course covers lots of important ideas and knowledges for Machine Learning practitioners. It is definitely nice to deal with topics such as grid search or scikit-learn, but I think the course only covers these topics in a nutshell, it is more superficially discussed. If you are interested in Machine Learning, you should definitely bring your own motivation to dive deeper into those topics.. Also, Dr. Koop speaks very very fast though.. I attended courses by Andrew Ng, his courses provide a way better comprehensibility for listeners. The notebooks are a bit weird, very easy to understand and are hence not challenging. If you really want to understand the algorithms deeply, I don't think this course is the right one. But all in all, I completed the course, but I don't think I was able to understand everything by taking the course only.",0,1,Enyang Wang,36707553

Plan of the Course not so rational: why include the one section about model parameters on its own, rather than for each model.I give it a 3 as the Instructor is smily and engaging, but it's a 2.5 mark (I have done another ML MOOC on another concurrent platform about the same topic, and the quality was much higher)",0,1,Luiz Cunha,11598995

2058735~COURSE!~bNfKJYcIEemsaArI-0TJTA,1636659558370,4,0,"I am grateful to have attended this course. I have learned quite a lot and I believe, now, I have a solid general understanding of some of the most common ML algorithms. The instructor, Anna Koop is very knowledable and she has a very clear way of explaining the concepts. The reason why I haven't rated it 5-star is because the course is not really designed around practice. It is rather conventional in the sense that the instructor takes the central stage and students don't get to practice much. Quizzes are good, but they are far from being enough to give learners actual experience of ""doing"" machine learning. I am aware of the vastness of the field, and maybe that's why they kept the course intructor centered, but I still expect courses to push learners more in trying out the methods themselves and learning by doing. Still, the course is very beneficial and has valuable content. It is a great knowledge source as well. Warmest regards.  ",0,0,Ubeydullah Keles,2058735
