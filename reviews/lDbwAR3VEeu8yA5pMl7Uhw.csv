56504330~COURSE!~lDbwAR3VEeu8yA5pMl7Uhw,1615114490147,3,0,"I love the step-by-step approach to conduct sentiment analysis in this course. The instructor guided me through all the code and therefore let me experiment on my own. However, I would appreciate if he could give more explanation on the theory (polarity score) and code concept (''join). Apart from the sentiment result of 'positive', 'negative' and 'neutral', everything else is the same as the Twitter Sentiment Analysis beginner course. I hope it would offer at least the concept of polarity score. Thank you for offering the course anyway!",0,0,Chung Man,56504330
