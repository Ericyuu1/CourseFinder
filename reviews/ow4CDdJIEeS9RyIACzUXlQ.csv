While purporting positive change, the very first discussion is an essay written by the racist, white nationalist, anti-immigration ecologist Garrett Hardin. The author was in favour of forced sterilization of non-white women and segregation to preserve the future, in other words, he is a white supremacist hero. Praising and recommending such an author sounds like dog-whistles. This course reminded me of the Commander telling Offred in the Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood: ""better never means better for everyone. It always means worse, for some"".

The course contents do not support the latter title. Changing the world does not happen by contributing to charity work or by introducing or improving education or fighting poverty. Changing the world must address and touch on subjects affecting governments including their roles in manipulating resources to their advantages and misuse of power.We all know, almost all, how powerful countries (militarily) dictate their terms and rules on governments of lesser advantage. Turning the latter into an ally by force for a period of time.  Sadam and Iraq were the USA's best ally for as long as the war between Iraq and Iran was going on. Once ceased, Saddam was a used card and his role was done, he was a good ally for a ""good considerable period of time"".  It was the time for him to go, especially we all, again,  remember that he had threatened Israel by launching rocket missiles.  Saddam was given the assurance that his invasion of Kuwait is an internal matter and that ""The USA did not take a stand on Arab-Arab conflicts such as Iraq's border with Kuwait"" (Wikipedia). Saddam was fool enough to swallow the bate purely due to his narcissistic nature.

Taboo topics such as animal agriculture (which is the main driver for climate change) are not addressed at all. Lastly, I would have loved some presence of representatives of for-profit companies in order to learn about their perspective- As, again, the participants are all form the non-profit or academic sectors- And I'm sure everybody agrees if you don't get the for-profits on-board- Any change is pretty hopeless.I found the first lesson by far the best, and the Environmental one the weakest, as the one lady only talks about her soil.",0,18,Frederik Otto,29739694
