The course shows the relations and interconnections between subject areas such as cosmology, astronomy, astrophysics, elementary particle physics, etc. It shows the connection and interdependence between quantum physics (the world of the very small) and large scale physics. I was astonished how much understanding of these complex (and often counter-intuitive) concepts can be achieved through simple (high school level) mathematics. The structure of the course has been well thought through. The sheets are nice and contain beautiful and instructive video clips. Furthermore the sheets can be downloaded as PDF’s, so that the course can be reviewed after a while.
