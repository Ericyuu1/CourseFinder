However, the Rhyme platform was a little annoying. I kept having to expand or close the videos or my cloud console to see the full screen of one or the other. Also, the text in the cloud console is super tiny. If you try to decrease the resolution, it will magnify to one part of the console and you can't see anything else. Having the software already installed on the cloud console is a plus, and the project time limit is tied to the videos, so if you're not understanding a concept or need to work a little longer, pause the video. No rush. The missing code that someone else mentioned is pinned in the discussion board, so the app can be fully functional as you do your project.",0,0,Erica Perich,60770280

There is much scope to add many functionalities to the existing app that was built during this course. Nevertheless, I would rate it 5 stars, since whatever was taught was just perfect. Looking forward to more complexity in the form of additional functionalities - if at all this can be added to the existing course, it WOULD BE THE BEST among all. Thanks a lot Ken! :)",0,0,Vishwadutt M. S.,37980194
