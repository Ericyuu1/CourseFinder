19443880~COURSE!~dT1keI-YEeq4CQqxweu3fw,1643134671342,4,0,"The material in the course was fine. Stop the peer-graded assignment stuff. I will never take another Coursera course with peer-graded assignments. One problem is waiting for others to submit their assignments so I can grade them. Then I am 'overdue' because there are no other assignments to grade. The other problem is some people just cut and paste garbage into these assignments. I am the student. I am not the 'police' that should be expected to downgrade people who don't do the assignment. I don't want to be that person. I paid to learn and not to police unethical behavior. Another possible problem is that I can end up waiting for someone else to grade my submission. Again, at no fault of my own, I am 'overdue' in completing my course. I will never take another Coursera course with peer-graded assignments. ",0,0,Rod Richards,19443880
