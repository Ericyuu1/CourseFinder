The final assignment as well as the grading method seems good to me, as it gives the opportunity to share examples of case studies from around the world and to give our opinion as well as to receive the opinion of our peers, I think that it is missing the feedback from one of the teachers of the course.
Thank you very much!",0,0,Maite Baquero,88607976
