27603880~COURSE!~GXUDWl0XEeijnRKwxEkmXg,1575511681171,2,0,"I have been using git in my current work for revision control but I didn't have a chance to systematically learn it and this is the reason I took the course.  Pro:  This course gave me an overview of essential parts of using git even though I need to dive into each part more than the course's material. I like this type way in learning.Cons: 1. For a beginner who didn't use any source control tool, I don't feel this is a good course to learn since there are very less practical examples. I feel the author assume you know or at least used other revision control tool. You would feel still don't know how to use it even though can pass all the quiz2. Much more reading than demonstration in the course. Also the content in the reading is not well organized in some sections. Easily to lose the logic why this shown here. I usually need to search for other material after looking through the reading session.  ",0,3,Yiding Yang,27603880
