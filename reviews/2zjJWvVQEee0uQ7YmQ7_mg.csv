75922306~COURSE!~2zjJWvVQEee0uQ7YmQ7_mg,1606128459087,1,0,"There is too much focus on quantitative financial analysis, and not enough time on explaining RL. Simple financial examples are beneficial to understand the practical use of RL in finance, but I felt that this course had a strong bias towards finance. I feel I still need to do further reading in order to apply RL in my work. The assignment did not supply all the data required to perform the tasks. The peer grading process did not work, we had to rely on sharing links in the discussion section to get our assignments graded. ",0,1,Charl Maree,75922306

Good overview of reinforcement learning in finance, but the presentations are not well formatted, and coding exercises are not helpful at all to improve.

Staff are ghosts, no responses whatsoever.Lectures are purely mathematical, there are no visualizations on how they fit to the code in the assignments. No explanations on how the code should work, no explanations on how we should provide our answers, graders are buggy. This course could be one of the best in Coursera, but it fails miserably. waste of time and money.",0,20,Omar Omeiri,41954887
3272125~COURSE!~2zjJWvVQEee0uQ7YmQ7_mg,1555290496190,1,0,"I leave this review after I have completed the specialization of all 4 courses.The first two courses of the specialization are somewhat useful in understanding some concepts, even though they are apparently not good enough and often full of bizarre design. Now here comes the third one, with much worse experience. The teaching quality is as mediocre as the first two. The instructor has been overly obsessed in his physics analogy without being aware what he actually needs to teach. The content is unnecessarily theoretical and makes one lost. I appreciate that this is intellectually interesting, maybe to some people. Nevertheless, it does not meet my expectation at all. The assignment of this course is open-ended and continue to be irrelevant from what the videos are.Conclusion: The course is not mature enough. If someone wants to learn machine learning in finance with efficiency and practicality, he or she should consider other options instead of this specialization/course.",0,43,Yi Bao,3272125

I think it's received mixed reviews because I can imagine it would be a lot to take in if you try and complete the course in the allocated time. However, if you do dedicate more time to it and study the support material (the pdf's at the bottom of each weeks content)  then things do start to become more clear. To get something out of this course I would recommended adjusting your expectations (in terms of time scales) and taking you're time (I've been doing it on and off for a couple of months) to complete the course.
