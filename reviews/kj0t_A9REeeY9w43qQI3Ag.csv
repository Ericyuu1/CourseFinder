70715759~COURSE!~kj0t_A9REeeY9w43qQI3Ag,1654163178167,1,0,Personally didn't like the course due to the format of explanation - the person who explains the simplest concepts formulates the explanation in a fairly lengthy way.

78456288~COURSE!~kj0t_A9REeeY9w43qQI3Ag,1611559800087,1,0,"Honestly, this course is an extremely inconsiderate program for those who have no prior knowledge in 2 unit/advanced maths. As someone who only completed general maths, I was burdened by the difficulties of the content being taught; especially when the lecturer himself didn't explain the content in a way that would allow me to understand. In effect, keeping up with the work, ensuring that I studied for the 20-minute assessments, making my own notes to study from, and just in general, trying to get through the work all became too overbearing. I ended up seeking help from outside sources such as youtube just so I could grasp a particular topic. And the issue wasn't with one particular topic it was with all of them. And I found that the lecturer did a lot of waffling. Now I'm not saying he was bad overall, but I just wish that the content could have been taught at a slower and understandable pace.",0,5,Nourhan Al Jinabi,78456288

When I would go back to my notes I would not remember ""what he said"" about a step. This may be an issue with my note taking, as I often had difficulty knowing which examples to copy word for word, and which to not spend too much time on. As a result, however, I spent hours taking notes in hopes to retain all the information, and I still had several times where something was missing. That being said, I sadly don't feel that I have a full grasp on the final week's materials.

Kudos to the professor and to Coursera, hopefully you can retain this course for a very long time.  A few points of improvement if I may.  I took this course as a refresher for previously haven taken calculus about three years ago.  There is no companion textbook, which I would have found invaluable.  I also wish that there were even more examples of worked/solved problems to draw from.  I believe that an inherent problem with math instruction is that through the use of symbology (by necessity), the student is expected to learn and understand all parts of written notes.  Instead, I strongly believe that plain language explanations of in conjunction with traditional lectures notes are most valuable.  If you do not understand a single portion of a problem, you are left (as I have been) at great length to try to find a comparable problem to digest what is occurring.  Lastly, I would suggest cultivating companion videos for the lectures from open sources such as Youtube that students could view in conjunction with each module.  Despite the very best of intentions and efforts, the video lectures move very fast and at times, I think there are clearer examples available elsewhere.  Often times the Khan Academy style of working through a problem while explaining it would be a great adjunct to the content here.  Again, I thank the Professor for his kindness and passion for math.

Nevertheless, I have one piece of advice for you: don't try to finish it in five weeks!Mathematics is a subject that can not be digested in large chunks. You will do well if you would study for just one lesson a day. Watch the lecture, read the notes, and solve the quiz after each subject. Don't study for more than one lesson per day as you will be too exhausted to concentrate. If you study one subject per day, it will take you three to four months to finish the course. This is the normal time for a university-level course. Also, you would need a thick notebook and a pencil to solve the problems and exams given in the course.   Calculus is the foundation of many scientific and all engineering disciplines. I hope that you will also pass this course. ",0,2,Mohammad Ben Salamah,14321802

41486398~COURSE!~kj0t_A9REeeY9w43qQI3Ag,1590624825369,5,0,"18 years ago, I failed grade 9 math with a 23%.  Today, I passed Introduction to Calculus on Coursera, which is offered through the University of Sydney and taught by Professor David Easdown. I wish I could say that I actually enjoyed the course, but I feel like that would be doing a disservice to the version of myself that has been pulling his hair out for the past 5 weeks.  Indeed, if I’ve learned anything during this process, I’ve learned that Calculus is hard.  Very hard.I will say, though, that this is in no way meant as a slight against Professor Easdown and the style of the course.  Quite the contrary; Professor Easdown is an incredibly engaging teacher and manages to make this very difficult subject digestible.  And while I wouldn’t say at this point that I can ‘do calculus’, I would say that the course was very, very rewarding and that it certainly provided a cohesive overview of the pertinent topics in the field, as well equipping the learner with a thorough understanding of the symbols, language, and relevance.  The notes that accompanied the lectures were very valuable and helped fill in the gaps, and the structure of the course was very smooth as you transitioned from one topic to the next. I took this course because I have been rolling through some courses in Artificial Intelligence and simply found that I was out of my depth and simply coding along without any idea of what I was actually doing.  And while memorizing algorithms and formulas has its benefits, I decided that I want to fully understand this field – and I don’t think that one can do this properly without a fundamental understanding of Calculus.  This course provides just that. The practice quizzes were more than a little challenging (with the last couple of questions usually very, very challenging).  I found that I often had to supplement the course with alternative resources, such as Youtube, Khan Academy, Symbolab, and so on.  I had to re-watch lectures and thoroughly dissect the reading notes.  As I mentioned, it was a very difficult process that had me pulling my hair out and I’m a bit ashamed to say that I nearly threw my laptop on several occasions.  However, as it is with learning any new skill, you just have to keep pushing through knowing that it will be worth it in the end.  Then you get to a module exam, and at this point you realize how you’ve learned so very much in such a small amount of time.  It’s honestly incredible.  And by the time you get to the very end of the course, which I did today, you realize that you somehow have all the prerequisite knowledge to step by step make sense of equations that might as well have been written in a different language just a month ago.  I don’t feel like I can describe that particular feeling.  In all, this course was one of the more rewarding things that I’ve done in recent memory, and I’m so very grateful to Professor Easdown for putting it out there and making such a thorough overview of the topic so accessible to anyone with the interest to pursue it.  I coupled this with 1blue3brown’s series The Essence of Calculus on Youtube, and between these two I feel like for the first time in my life I have a true appreciation for the art of mathematics and I’m very eager and inspired to carry on with my studies in this field.  Thank you so very much.  Jack",0,15,jack smye,41486398

I would recommend it to anyone, whatever their field of study or level; just to open their minds about the beauty of one of mankind's greatest achievements, but also to develop a more rigorous, rational and analytical way of thinking. The latter adjectives are exactly what characterize this course. The lectures are straight to the point, the additional readings are of higher quality than anything that you'll ever expect to find in the most classic textbooks on the subject (trust my words, I have an extensive collection of these). And of course, David Easdown's way of presenting along with the graphics in the videos are as clear as crystal.   This is not a full course in calculus but an introduction. So, it has the imperfections of any introductory courses and should be taken as a complement to more advanced courses tailored for your needs. Yet, this single course has achieved the phenomenal outcome of being interesting both to students working on their A level and someone like me who's currently doing a PhD in Economics. I learnt much more here than anywhere since I first started calculus 10 years ago; I came for a refresher before attacking more advanced topics, and I'm leaving with a deep understanding of how things (which I thought irrelevant) are interdependent and make full circle. For future attendees, have an open mind: go along with the pace of the course, attempt all the exercises and don't overestimate your understanding. At the end it pays off. Thanks to David Easdown and his team for their passion and for putting the full course free of charge.  I hope that the advanced course will come soon. ",0,19,Andy Finette ,53996318

Everything is explained from the ground up, and it is clear that the course aims to provide a thorough and fundamental understanding of the topic, rather than simply learning by rote or procedure. If something isn't explained fully, we are told why (usually due to complexity) and are told where to look if we wish to find out more. The assessments are perfectly structured and strike the balance between challenging and accessible. If there is any trouble, Professor Easdown is very active in the Discussion Forums and provides excellent guides to any difficult problems. This course is substantial, but not overwhelming. I found myself doing around an hour a day on average.

His explanations are extremely clear,  making students understand and appreciate mathematical concepts, and not only to mechanically apply formulas. He provides great lecture notes and readings which cover the topics explained in the videos, sometimes with deeper explanations and proofs. In the notes, there are also examples of exercises, which are very helpful for successfully completing the quizzes accompanying each module.  The discussion forum is a great learning place. There are many interesting questions posed by peers and you can post your questions there too. The professor is very active and very kindly replies to any query in a very timely manner.

It was not a problem during my bachelor's studies in Linguistics, but became a huge issue now, once I've begun my Master's in Data Science. Finally I feel my studies getting easier, and my skin becoming cleaner and smoother every day (not really).Seriously though, this is one of the courses (especially comparing to those from Russian universities) that feel like they were actually being meant to be studied by human beings. Furthermore, it does not require a full payment (or financial aid, at that) to take tests, which are also by far more numerous and frequent than I am used to (a huge plus).To sum up, one of the best courses I've had a fortune of taking (so far). It felt really beneficial, considering I have to virtually build up my base from nothing in a very limited amount of time: exams are coming, and I still have a whole ""statistics"" field to cover. Moreover, it gave me a solid foundation which now  allows me to (for now) selectively add urgent things like Taylor series and get into multivariate calculus.

This course really doesn’t assume too much pre-calculus knowledge and instead contains a pre-calculus refresher that lays the groundwork for the calculus in later modules. Although a few times I needed to pause the video lectures to give myself enough time to understand the logic in later modules, overall the video lectures were presented in a straight-forward and engaging manner. David Easdown communicated concepts concisely and his way of speaking and enthusiasm for math helped keep me engaged with the video lectures. The readings are also well put together and allow you to go over video material (plus more for certain lessons) at your own pace. Practice problems were mostly easily although a few could be a bit more challenging (but not too much). As much as I would have liked a few more challenging problems, it is an introductory course, so the current question difficulty makes sense to me.

The quizzes and exercises are challenging enough to make you think and feel rewarded for being able to solve them, but not enough to make you want to quit them (in fact, I had a lot of fun doing them!). My advice to other people that want to take the course is not to rush it and to do all readings and exercises (try to get a perfect score in all the exercises and to understand all the questions before attempting each week's quiz).
