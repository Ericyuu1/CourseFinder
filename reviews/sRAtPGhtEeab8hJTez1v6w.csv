I was highly disappointed at the quality of assignments coming for peer review. The structure of the course needs a change to discourage unethical practice of submitting bogus files in the names of assignments and pleading in the discussion group to get it rated in exchange for other's bogus work to be rated. This rampant practice has to be stopped by making changes to the assignments grading system. ,0,1,Gaurav Regmi,4293806
