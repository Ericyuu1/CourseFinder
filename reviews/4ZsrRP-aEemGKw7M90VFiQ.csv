29548932~COURSE!~4ZsrRP-aEemGKw7M90VFiQ,1598980045574,4,0,"A lot of interesting material there is in this course. Especially interviews with witnesses were very heartbreaking. Each instructor in this course are great. Highly recommend learning history of the Holocaust with them. But also I would like advice for creators of this course to add tests and quizzes. Such tasks help to remember and understand more and then check your knowledge and your progress. By the way about progress. This course doesn't support certificate or grades and because of it you can not complete this course like another one. It will be In progress column, even if you watched each video and did all exercises. Nonetheless, ""Chosen Issues in Holocaust History"" will be a great experience for history lover.
