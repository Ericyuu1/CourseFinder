18282591~COURSE!~23ktW204Eeu__hKCAZP3Iw,1676040171511,3,0,The course is an introduction with a lot of repetitions from other courses of this specialization. I don't like how the information is prepared. A lot of videos are lectures from the instructor's work in university and from other courses (e.g. courses from Udacity). Don't think that certificate really costs that money.,0,0,Oleksandr Sapozhnik,18282591
