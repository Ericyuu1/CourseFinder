For beginners yes... and I'd put this at about a Grade 7-8 level of teaching, perhaps. Much to simplified and not enough details. People are not told that there are online resources to check spelling and grammar that are very helpful and writing programs, as well. I copied the transcripts for my own use later, only to find spelling errors, grammar mistakes and the wrong words being used, all things that were under the what not to do category in one of your modules. The only good thing about this course is that it kept my brain moving and motivated to write.

There are brief mentions here and there and the interviews are all with children's authors, but it's mostly very general stuff. Additionally, because it tries to cover a lot of ground, no topic is every delved into very deeply. We're talking 4 minutes of video on setting, 7 minutes on plot and theme, that sort of thing. It's all rather surface-level information.I'm a non-beginner writer and though I did get the sense early on that there would be a lot of ""Writing 101"" content, I stuck around due to the course leader's promise that more experienced writers could get a lot out of it too. I was waiting for it to delve into its promised topic, but it never really did.What I WOULD say I got out of this course, and why I didn't ultimately abandon it, was the sense of accountability, which gently forced me to get some writing done, to finish pieces. So that was good.The peer review system is what you might expect. More of an easy way for the course leaders to confirm that people were actually doing the exercises (so that finishing it has some sort of meaning) than a good way to get genuinely useful feedback.MY ADVICE: take this course if you're a newer writer interested in writing for children/teens who hasn't really done any prior learning about the craft of storytelling. The course and its assignments could very well be useful for you. If you're more experienced and familiar with storytelling craft, you might take this course if the deadlines it imposes helps motivate you to write. Don't expect much, if any, valuable feedback.If you're looking to truly delve deep into the craft and business of writing for young audiences, I'd recommend you instead get a hold of Cheryl B.

I was failed because my explanatory note - not the piece itself, just a note for context -  took me 34 words over. How pedantic was that reader? Another piece I read was over 2000 words long and had obviously been taken from some other assignment: it barely fit the study brief. Additionally, are non English speaking students penalised by having to write in English? Grammar and syntax in the west is very different depending on the country you come from - German syntax vs Italian vs English. All are different.
