21716138~COURSE!~X9H10cqoEeWhwwrjksNQhQ,1487796056404,2,0,"Most of this course felt inconsequential, unhelpful, and not worth the money.  I'd condense some of the commonsense aspects into other sections of the course and eliminate the 20-40 minutes of filler videos.",0,1,David Byer,21716138
23091038~COURSE!~X9H10cqoEeWhwwrjksNQhQ,1483999069782,2,0,"I took onus with a number of ideas/concepts offered, simply because they are either misrepresentative of SM or untrue.  First, the the ""prof"" who talked about visuals OVERPLAYED the role of visuals online. The Internet began as a text communications vehicle, not a medium to share graphics (etc).  The rise of video, images only grew as the technology evolved to allow easy distribution.  Words are still key online--are there ANY websites major who do not use words?  In fact, for many of the good ones, visuals take a secondary role to the actual written content.  Second, the section about joining a community and then faking your way to gaining credibility by posing as a newbie etc--especially by marketers--is highly reviled by many SM communities.  As an INFLUENCER who has been approached by many marketers in the past decade ""to help them understand something"" (etc) I can tell you, we do suss you out quickly and treat you appropriately.  We are not here to provide free consulting to make you feel or look competent or knowledgeable (as we would for real members of a community).  I contacted a friend who's an influencer in different communities to me, with what your ""expert"" suggested.  He, too, was not happy with what was in this unit. If you want to know why marketers have a bad rep?  It's because of bad advice given in webinars like this one.  I am so glad I did not pay for this course. ",0,1,J M,23091038

The content was very comprehensive and meaningful.However, I would repeat one feedback for all these courses:I would have preferred to have the Case Study in the third week instead of the second.
