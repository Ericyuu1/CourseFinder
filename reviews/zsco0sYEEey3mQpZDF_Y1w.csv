1427998~COURSE!~zsco0sYEEey3mQpZDF_Y1w,1673025939395,3,0,"Everything seems well presented but I tried to sit with ARM Development Studio (I never used that before) and I can't make anything to work properly, and nothing is covered about how to actually code the presented materials. The only optional exercise about tarmac trace returns only hardfault errors with most basic code possible and there is no way to figure this out on your own. It's kind of annoying when you try to learn something and everything is sooo cumbersome to configure, starting from trial license where you need to give the ARM your address and phone number, reading the tutorials which doesn't help at all because you did everything step by step and then eventually looking for some tutorials online without success. If it's already expected from you to know this stuff then why would I take this course?",0,1,Ernest Warzocha,1427998
