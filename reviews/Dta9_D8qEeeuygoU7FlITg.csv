Some of the content is decent, though highly biased and single-sided. The set-up, with lots of peer assessment, may have worked initially, when there were lots of participants; now, it is tedious at best, and makes it impossible for participants to meet their deadlines.",0,0,Dave Lommen,2098468

The course material is at the knowledge level, but many of the assignments ask for analysis.  The assignment rubric was not viewable prior to posting the first assignment.  I did not receive my first peer review, where I could actually view the rubric until I had already submitted 5 of the 7 assignments.  The info on data analytics was enlightening.  The final section, on program evaluation, was very generic and not specific to education.  I could make the leap to see how it could be relevant, but since this was billed as a basic level course, I should not have had to make that leap.  I was somewhat surprised that there was absolutely no reference to Kirkpatrick's four levels of educational evaluation.  I did learn a few things I didn't know before, but I do not believe I developed any new skills.",0,2,Julia I Crutchfield,65382417

I only wish that the rubric for the peer review is more specific to include the number of academic review to receive a certain number of points. The rubric only says, ""Formal scholarly referencing and web links to a comprehensive range of sources"" So for example, when I provided six to seven academic references, I received 15 points rather than 20. Also, the rubric does not require providing feedback when points are taken. So, most reviewers took points because they can, not because they have an academic reason. Honestly, if I am paying for the course, I would like to receive feedback to understand why points are taken. Providing feedback is essential to grow and is a factor in my decision to pay for a course. ",0,3,Mishkat Al Moumin,24352936
