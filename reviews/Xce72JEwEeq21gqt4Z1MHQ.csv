58995843~COURSE!~Xce72JEwEeq21gqt4Z1MHQ,1596275372648,1,0,"This is not exactly a great course. Implementing the same code does not give the correct output. Others seem to have the same issue as well, but the discussion forum is also of no use. The issue is not resolved. The idea is great but the execution is not. Had higher expectations.",0,0,GAURI MNIT,58995843
19232793~COURSE!~Xce72JEwEeq21gqt4Z1MHQ,1614315466260,3,0,"I do not recommend taking this type of course, take one and pass it, however after a few days I have tried to review the material, and my surprise is that it asks me to pay again to be able to review the material. Of course coursera gives me a small discount for having already paid it previously.
It is very easy to download the videos and difficult to get hold of the material, but with ingenuity it is possible. Then I recommend uploading them to YouTube and keeping them private for when they want to consult (they avoid legal problems and can share with friends), then they can request a refund.

The ending of the project got confusing as there was a minor error in the code, a comma needed to be added. In the video, the correction was done quickly and the screen switched from the jupyter notebook to the streamlit interface so fast, that I had to play the video back a few times to identify the exact moment where the correction was made. Then I looked at the screen and realized that a comma was added.As an instructor myself, I understand that re-recording parts of the project can be daunting. Perhaps you can add an annotation explaining that a comma needed to be added.",0,0,Vinita Silaparasetty,27241062
