22305187~COURSE!~wpuvI4QzEeaT3g7PD2zpfw,1523375781770,2,0,"Very unclear terminology (ex: are categories different from themes in the analysis? Who knows, I still don't) and illogical ordering of information within a given week's lecture made it difficult to fully conceptualize how the various concepts formed a cohesive whole. Showing examples (that weren't the cellphone business case scenario) would have been extremely helpful to help solidify taught concepts.  This is particularly true when the course is explaining a visual representation of something, but doesn't actually show the object being discussed; I really wanted to understand how to use a spreadsheet for qual analysis, but never got to see an example, and the description from the instructor was very unclear with terms like rows and columns used sparingly. Paradoxically, what information was Covered a lot of the same concepts multiple times, but without adding new information or perspective. ",0,7,Aaron Fehir,22305187
