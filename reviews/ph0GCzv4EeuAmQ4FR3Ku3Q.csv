386527~COURSE!~ph0GCzv4EeuAmQ4FR3Ku3Q,1630595446465,5,0,"This is the best course I have taken so far with Dr.Chuck, If you want to learn advanced topics on PostgreSQL, this is the course. Dr.Chuck will teach you complex subjects is a simple way, with simple examples that will give you foundation knowledge so you can master very complex points.  This a summary of what was covered at this course : Differentiate between HASH index and B-tree index. Create a reverse index for a table of documents. Utilize stop words with a reverse index. Create a GIN-based text[] reverse index. Differentiate and utilize the ts_vector() and ts_query() functions. creating a natural language full-text index on a column. Compare Python functions with PostgreSQL functions. Connect and compare Python and PostgreSQL. Utilize Python to insert data into a table with a given schema.  Load and store JSON documents in a table. Recall which index type is typically used for JSON in PostgreSQL. That""s what I was talking about !  And don""t worry if you didn""t know Python because the examples are very easy on that and you will have templates to guide you so you can follow the course. After all if  get to this point something of programming you have to know, and with some basic Python you can manage it and will have a good support on the forums. I highly recommend this course for PostgreSQL fans !",0,0,Fabio Barcello Sipoli Dos Reis Muller,386527
