61842775~COURSE!~Z6YpTXxQEeetPBIrxoVF_A,1655854147471,2,0,"Tâ€‹his course was informative, but something needs to change for the Peer Review Assignment.  Many of the other students do not grade properly, and it is obvious that they do not speak or read English as their primary fluency.  This is a big issue, as when as assignment is graded, the scoring is sporadic and inconsistent, resulting in a poor grade average.  Peer Review Assignments should additionally be reviewed by a Professor or adjunct professor to ensure impartiality, accuracy, and consistency.",0,0,Warren W. Goldman,61842775
20343092~COURSE!~Z6YpTXxQEeetPBIrxoVF_A,1527566066012,2,0,"Even though pretty much all the courses in the Patient Safety specialization are very informative and up to a certain level that you would expect, the grading system is as such that it depends on peer reviews. This means there is a lack of standard for grading and individuals might come across problems due to this. Especially when on a time limit consider this. Therefore, I find it definitely not worth paying for a subscription and certificate, just do the course a self study and safe yourself a headache!",0,3,K.N. Saha,20343092
