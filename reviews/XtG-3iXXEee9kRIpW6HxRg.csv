I was excited to have found a place to take classes where I could earn a certificate. The teachers for DNA Decoded Felicia and Cait were really amazing and I feel bad for them because overall, the support was awful. I don't know who to talk to, I don't believe I can talk to anyone. I just finished the course and it says my grade was 66%. I have no idea how this happened. I should have received a much higher mark.

41195652~COURSE!~XtG-3iXXEee9kRIpW6HxRg,1631846075410,5,0,"I took this course, with medical and graduate school-level understanding of the topics covered, primarily to get ideas on how such complex material can be taught to teenagers and/or early-in-major/non-major college students. The presentation of the material is creative, and the emphasis on “broad strokes” or key points, that are required at minimum to grasp more intricate concepts down the line (and beyond the scope of this course), is delivered clearly. 

I highly appreciate the energy of the presenters throughout the course, but I have to admit that there are few moments that I cringed with the humor (this is understandable, since I believe that I do not belong to the target audience of this offering, anyway). 

Furthermore, this course has also allowed me to re-acknowledge the basics that are often taken for granted or minded fleetingly as you work on/study more complex molecular biology concepts. 

The added/optional references are also generally topnotch. With regard to relevant history of the field, I have learned new details on the people, circumstances and processes that led to some key discoveries. Unfortunately, some reference links no longer lead to useful content and are due for editing/updating by the course creators. Also, I encountered fatal issues in attempting to use the virtual laboratory simulator, which I thought is an added layer to ensure driving home important points particularly in the step-by-step conduct of techniques.

I wish that I have taken a material like this 15 years ago. All in all, I highly recommend this course to anyone of all ages who wish to have an overview of molecular biology that demands no prerequisite knowledge. In particular, I hope kids and teens can take this course so they can be properly introduced to the potential this field can offer them should they embark on this path.
