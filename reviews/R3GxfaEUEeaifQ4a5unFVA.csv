I also appreciated how the material was grouped into certain locations. From this course, I even made my own investigations into Ephesus in Turkey, and the Gleninagh stones in west Ireland.However, there were some major weaknesses in the course which made the progress difficult.

1) Anything in the exams of a course needs to be clearly explained in the course content, before the test. If we need to do extra research, then there must be instructions to tell us.  Many of the exam questions came out of nowhere and I had to guess or do my own research.2) I appreciated reading about the mathematics behind archaeoastronomy, but if I see a mathemtical formula, then I expect to use it. We need to see practical demonstrations of the theory.3) I respect the time, courage and effort by Professor Magli, but too many times he read English text using Italian phonetics. This meant he frequently mispronounced words, and I had to read the transcript to understand him. I'm very sorry to say this because I am an academic English teacher (meaning, I often hear mistakes from students) as well as an Italian speaker, and trying to interpret his frequent errors was very distracting. Please, in future, get help from a trained English speaker.I think the concept and the content are fascinating, but the presentation and the organisation of the material needs to be revised.",0,1,David Peachey,26673603

I didn't even know what azimuth meant until Week 7 when I decided to look it up on the Internet. If I had known earlier, some things might have made more sense.

Regarding the tutor's comment  about Tihuanaco - the alignments match 15 millennia ago but 'what do you think is more likely...', a slight error from the builders of this magnificent construction or the errors of (mainstream) archaeologists - I go with with the errors of the (mainstream) archaeologists every time!
