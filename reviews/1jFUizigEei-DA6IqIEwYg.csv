46913061~COURSE!~1jFUizigEei-DA6IqIEwYg,1587986433132,2,0,"The topic is interesting but I have difficulties engaging with many of the lectures; the speech is stunted in many cases, and very distracting. As well, graphs are not explained sufficiently; it's easier to pause the video and read the transcription instead.The quizzes also demonstrate a lack of effort. Sometimes the response requires a numerical value, of which was NOT CLEAR in the video, and requires a lot of linguistic hurdles to understand.",0,1,mp,46913061

60561812~COURSE!~1jFUizigEei-DA6IqIEwYg,1593424407211,5,0,"Through this course, I was able to learn about different aspects of the arctic. As someone who lives far away from the arctic, I had used to think that the Arctic would not affect me as much but ever since I took up this course,  I had started to realize that effects of the arctic are real and in reality, felt in my daily life in many ways that easily go unnoticed - weather changes, for instance.  I had also realized how the arctic itself had so many social aspects or factors influencing it - its history, the people living there and countries from all over the world as well. Really thankful to have been able to take this course! ",0,1,"Chen Yuan En, Rachael",60561812

I found myself intently listening to all the professors and speakers and was also excited to be learning lesson after lesson. I feel like the course was well structured and the content that was taught was spread sufficiently and went into just the right depth. - being it never got overly complicated nor did it ever feel too easy. I liked this course, I feel it was great! ",0,0,Vera Lau,60999134

Many aspects were especially interesting since I'm Russian but never thought under a new angle. Urgently recommend this interdisciplinary course for everybody.
