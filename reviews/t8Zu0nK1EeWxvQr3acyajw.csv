Even if you don't have any experience in Investment Management, the lectures are clear and you learn so much.  I do have one suggestion for the capstone project and this was the reason I gave this course four stars vice five.  The project assumes learners are very familiar with Excel when some are not.  It came as a surprise to me that such emphasis was put on Excel, especially since it was rarely utilized in the previous courses.  Anyway, I suggest you somehow provide more warning to learners about this in advance of the capstone.  Having said the above, though, I imagine this is one of the better specializations offered and would highly recommend it to all.  Finally, I would be remiss if I did not specifically mention Dr. Michel Girardin.  What a wonderful instructor and motivator!  He clearly loves teaching and had the most effective methodology.
