12313402~COURSE!~YGioDOZoEeq_HApkDk8V_Q,1640149416692,5,0,"This project walks through basic usage of scikit-learn's ensemble models.  Their use is demonstrated both as stand alone models and as layers in a heterogeneous stacking model.  The presentation was perfect for me because I knew the theory behind these models but not so much the scikit-learn usage.  I strongly advise reading about bagging, boosting, etc. before doing the project, if you don't already have a theoretical background.",0,0,Michael Fischbein,12313402
