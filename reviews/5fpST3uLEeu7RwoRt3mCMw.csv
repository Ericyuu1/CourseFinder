94992604~COURSE!~5fpST3uLEeu7RwoRt3mCMw,1639339657048,1,0,Poor quality IBM wants people to insert their credit card when in this course they charge $200. Also the are a lot of problems in completing this course I could not complete it because the staff members say they are working on a solution but it has been months and no solution to address the problems especially the credit card issues. Also one can not interact with the instructors and the staff through MS Teams or Zoom to address common problems you are only allowed to send text messages through the forum which is not time efficient. I would not recommend this course there are problems which prevent one from completing the course. ,0,3,Siyabonga Khoza,94992604

105682346~COURSE!~5fpST3uLEeu7RwoRt3mCMw,1676026107047,3,0,"While some of the course material is great, there are some parts that require you to have more knowledge than what is being taught. I was under the impression that I would learn everything during the courses. Some of the information in the courses are not available and looking up  some answers will give you information information from different systems. This would be a 5 star course if there was more information on some subjects and the right information for others.",0,0,Christopher Jackson,105682346

Also information about Db2 is so not cleared. The course let you look it in the website yourselves and then the website also is not cleared and not user friendly. BigQuery from Google is way better and easier. But the SQL concept of the first part of the course is good and understandable.",0,1,Sorravith Jaichuen,25635089
25499361~COURSE!~5fpST3uLEeu7RwoRt3mCMw,1632834775127,3,0,"I would put this a 3.5 instead of a three, but there is no option for that and i do not think it is a 4. The main problem with this course was that they threw at you a lot of complex concepts, functions and operations without letting you practice. Then, at the end, they put a practice lab in which you have to wrap up everything which you have learned, evidently, given the fact that this is a lot of things, you have forgotten things already. Also, there are some things that they never explain, for example the command sqlSave was never mentioned in the videos, and appears randomly at the lab. In the end, you can learn a lot of things with this course, but from week 4 and forward you will have to put a big autonomous effort to understand things correctly. Week 1 to 3 are ok, though week 1 and 2 are somewhat redundant",0,2,Rafael Pabon,25499361

2861793~COURSE!~5fpST3uLEeu7RwoRt3mCMw,1626075440139,4,0,"The course was well-structured, informative and easy to follow. One suggestion for improvement I have is that a cheat-sheet or catalogue of sorts be provided within the course, which collates all the coding and syntax from the course onto one single space.This is especially helpful while taking up the course as part of the specialization series. It isn't easy to remember precise code syntax after just one or two uses of a function. As I progressed through the courses in the specialization, I found myself having to return to previous courses and comb through the hands-on labs to retrieve specific codes, functions and syntaxes. This was time-consuming and wasteful, and can easily be remedied by a list of codes (with syntax) used in an entire course.Apart from that, great effort by the team, and a big thank you to the creators, developers, moderators and testers!",0,2,Milcah Mary Joseph,2861793
