86464434~COURSE!~ZLvhe1yyEeqRbA7uHbU8Mw,1622531650356,1,0,"I don't think I learned a lot from this class. I am really disappointed and I think I wasted my time taking this class.  The Class focuses on  how to using sytanx , and it doea not explain concepts clearly. After taking the class, I am still confused about Collections and Interface. I end up going to read more java documents to understand it. I hope it goes deeper.  ",0,0,Ziyao Chen,86464434
68028805~COURSE!~ZLvhe1yyEeqRbA7uHbU8Mw,1620016933031,1,0,"This course failed teach. It's heavy  on ""what to do"" and very light on ""why you do it.""  There's no community of students, no support in the forum (a total ghost town), and the code is not quality tested resulting in frustrating learning experience.. Don't believe the numbers on Coursera, I'm one of the only students to complete this course. I recommend, instead, that you take Harvard's CS50 (on EdX). I'm going to take CS50 myself, now, to learn the materials (theory, principles, purpose) that weren't taught here. Strong suggestion to move on.",0,5,Patrick Ryan,68028805

Difficulty level is a bit high for a newbie. Except that I think this is the best course for someone who's done with java core and want to polish up his/her skill. You'll learn a lot from the course's assignments and its grading system. Perfect implementation of more practical work than theoretical.",0,1,TARUN BISHT,61919633

I've also been waiting 4+ days for a response from the staff to help with issues I've left in the forum. This is the first UPenn course in Coursera that I've had to wait this long and still not receive any clarification. Other than that it's a good course.,0,0,Cecilia Peña Tsakim,32846545

76109079~COURSE!~ZLvhe1yyEeqRbA7uHbU8Mw,1644200621741,5,0,"This is the last course of the Specialization: ""Introduction to Programming with Python and Java"". As a ""beginner"" with no prior experience in programming with Python and Java, the Specialization has been a fantastic experience. I can absolutely recommend it to everyone looking for a solid introduction with leanings applicable to the real world.
The instructor is on the spot, the curriculum follows a clear structure, and the assignments are hands-on and challenging enough to get you sweating and be grateful for the discussion forums.
Overall, the courses were a great source of motivation and encouraged me to continue with computer science.

Well done, Brandon and Team! Thank you so much!",0,0,Adrian Jacob,76109079

I never feel as confident as now to put myself in the programming related job. Actually I'm quite excited to finish this course and get all four certificates. T​he most beatiful moment is after you click submit or ""mark as complete"" followed by a fireworks message prompt out with your cert. A good rewarding mechanism.I​n short, I love this course, it is a milestone of my personal life.",0,1,Raymond Zhang,33671001

This course delves deeper into some of the nuances of Java such us abstract methods and alternate Collections. It has been very useful in building more robust, efficient code that breaks less often and provides more accurate results. The material is very well put together, and the discussion forums, as always, are very helpful if you get stuck on a problem.",0,0,Gabriel Tauro,58155702
