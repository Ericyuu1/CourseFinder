A lot of material is covered, and I did feel, at times, that some of the music theory could be explained in a little more depth, but given the time constraints of a four-week course, I guess I understand. I'd like to see this course expanded to perhaps six weeks in order to cover things like avoiding crossing voices in counterpoint and I would have liked an exercise for three-part counterpoint. I also think a clearer list of prerequisite knowledge could be included for this course. Either that, or a quick lesson on chord inversions, for those who need it.

1936283~COURSE!~FWWVyYq2EeitHg5-mgRbaA,1586444902060,5,0,I loved this course because it is packed with very clearly explained lessons and I really enjoyed every video. The assignments gave me lots of opportunity to practice but they did take me more than 30 minutes to do each one.  I would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in getting into music theory.,0,0,veronica hsueh,1936283

20584460~COURSE!~FWWVyYq2EeitHg5-mgRbaA,1581963399916,5,0,"   In first place, I have to say that the time required is much higher than 3-6 hours/week. At least for those of us not proficient at sight reading, writing and reading music, which is an important part of the exercises, takes a lot of time. I found useful to use a program to generate music scores.  The spirit of the course is of learning by doing. There are more than 20 exercises where the student has to write pieces in different styles, from folk to gregorian to atonal. two part counterpoint and more. There is not much theory but, at least for me, the experience has been very good. Reviewing others' scores and being reviewed is an interesting experience, because the same music can be perceived in many ways, depending of the listener/reader.   An important part of the course is listening to a lot of music in spotify. All pieces can be found also in youtube.",0,1,Rafael Moreno Jimenez,20584460

22512557~COURSE!~FWWVyYq2EeitHg5-mgRbaA,1565383894228,5,0,"I very much enjoyed this course. However, I will need more practice before I will automatically see all these things in the music I am studying.  I chose it primarily for the harmony part. I was pleasantlysurprised how helpful the first two weeks were for my general understanding of music and how the pointersreally helped me for composing music. I feel much more structured and oriented now, should I endeavour in writing music. It also helped my analytical skills a lot. This is mostly due to the peer review assignments I had to review. This role change brought me a further understanding on the concepts treated in class. As for counterpoint and harmony, it was a good start. I fell in love with counterpoint in particular and maybe got a bit addicted.The harmony part was interesting to me - however, I feel we rushed a bit through the concepts. I would love to deepen my understanding there. this section could benefit from more exercises, not only the finals. Also, the part tested in the finals is a very small aspect of what was treated in that lecture - to really understand the lecture I would like some more assignments. If there is a follow-up course available, I would be extremly interested!On the structure& formal things: I think the structure over all was very good. The ""see one-do one-teach one"" principle is very well applied and the course offers maximum teaching success given its online, remote form. The questions in the forum were always answered quickly and well so. To my feeling, the course's concept suffers a bit from the relatively low number of participants. In particular in week 3 & 4 there are not enough projects to review. I suggest that older projects from former students are still available to the new onesas to counteract this partiular issue. The class is definitely for people who have already practised music over several years and have had basic theory education. Otherwise, the exercises, especially imitating composing styles, would be nearly impossible with only the instructions given.  The hours indicated are but an indication. Writing music AND reviewing other people's music takes more time. In week 4 had to stop the video repeatedly to catch up with what was discussed and write down my thoughts, needed ca double the time. Especially week 2 + 3 kicked my butt time-wise.I was irked by the strong use of spotify and the link to academia.edu. The latter appears untrustworthy from the amount of data it collects from its users, and spotify also needs an account. Given that this class is an education, I would appreciate open source/open access platforms or simply hosting the music on coursera. As a lost note,  about week 1.5 I got used to the instructors humour and now it is an integral part of the fun in the class for me. Help!",0,10,Chris,22512557

I wish I had more teachers that were this engaging. I also enjoy the subject matter. Since learning the piano for 8 years Theory is starting to click.
