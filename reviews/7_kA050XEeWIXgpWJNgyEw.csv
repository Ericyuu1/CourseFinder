17271181~COURSE!~7_kA050XEeWIXgpWJNgyEw,1466828971987,3,0,"Overall this course has some valuable information. Although, I found the pace was a bit fast, only covered enough to get by, not gradually building up to a point. Each assignment or lab you first have to struggle figuring out the skeleton code where they could have provided a bit more comments, tips and guidance. I would recommend this course for someone that at least have a basic Java or programming background. Not for complete new developers.",0,0,Christo Pretorius,17271181

11138856~COURSE!~7_kA050XEeWIXgpWJNgyEw,1495891703336,4,0,"I like that this time while watching the video, there is ample time to import the project mentioned while explaining what it will do before running it. There should be links on how to add things to the emulator such as ringtones. I would have to stop and try to research these things online. Some of the code in the app displayed in the video were a bit different than in the course documents. I also liked that we  ad to build an app from scratch at the end which incorporates/combines all that we had learnt. I always like the forums which answers most of the problems I come across with.",0,0,Miah Jn Charles,11138856
