Today I’ve collected a dot as to ecology and learnt how it connects to other areas. My first expectation of learning ecology was that I wanted to understand the climate change problem through the lens of ecologists. I hoped to get into the roots of environmental issues and to acquire new knowledge that helps me pave the way for my dissertation in computer engineering.

You know what? I think I got much more than I expected. Despite the very well constructed content, I got inspiration from the course instructors, especially Dr Corina Tarnita from Princeton University, who uses mathematical modeling to explain natural phenomena, such as population growth and patterns of trees growing in the forest. It’s fantastic to see the role of interdisciplinary and of course mathematics everywhere.

This course, Ecology: Ecosystem Dynamics and Conservation, gave me a whole picture of the ecosystem in multiple perspectives, including biology, economy, and society. I learnt how to think systematically not only about the tip of the iceberg. I really enjoyed the course and learnt a lot!

However, there are many steps to go and to learn.

balance of whole ecosystems. I learned not only what was being studied within the vast field of ecology but also how it was being studied, including
field experiments and mathematical modelling. It was exciting to be taken along
for the ride and see the research unfold with new data. The relations between
termite behaviour, mathematical patterns in landscapes and their effects on the
rest of the ecosystem are mind-blowing.Be aware that the readings take quite a bit
longer than 10 minutes, and there is occasionally some overlap between an
article and a video. I was slightly disappointed that my good questions (in my
