I took it with two friends of mine, all of us at varying levels on the spectrum, and it took all three of us together to parse several of the lectures past the rambling, as well as figuring through very vague instructions for the assignments. Being that this course is apparently meant for absolute beginners per the first video, it should have given a lot more time to build up student skills. Maybe lengthening the course to spend more time on smaller chunks or dividing it up into two separate courses would have been a better option.

But instead you just get a brief explanation as if you already know the topic. That makes things too complicated. I did the last assignment without any clue of what am I doing and why. Just wanted to finish the course.

It's either an incredibly obvious answer, or some goofy joke-type answer. Either way, I feel like those quizzes were just an unwelcome interruption for me since they offered me nothing in terms of solidifying or checking the knowledge I was getting from the videos. Secondly, I want to talk about the structure of the course itself. While I think the overall structure and pacing is good, I do have some criticism as to the speed at which the instructor would go through some of the code. It started out with the Dr. explaining every single line of code, which is great if you know absolutely nothing about coding(as the course is geared towards those who don't) but then starting from the Week 2 content, I felt as though the instructor sped through a lot of the content, and he stopped explaining as much of the base code, choosing to skip a lot of it. Now, I should say that I came to this course with some fundamental knowledge of C# and unity as I've done other courses before, so this was fine for me and I could keep up. However, if I HAD come to this course with 0 experience then I would have 100% been absolutely lost starting from week 2. For those reading this considering taking this course: this IS a good course, and you learn a lot from it, however do be ready to struggle quite a bit with the content and expect to sit there rewatching a lot of the videos in order to keep up. Lastly, I'd like to talk about Assignment structure. This is, for me, the worst thing about this course. The assignments themselves are good assignments, and you learn a lot from doing them. that isn't the issue here. the issue is the way in which you have to do them and submit them. The automatic grader is made in such a way that penalizes you for so many things, that if you have even a simple formatting difference such as an extra space in your output (Ex. e  -1 instead of e -1) then you are graded a 0 automatically. I realize that it's difficult to make an automatic grader respond to different kinds of output and I have no suggestions for how to make it better. I'm just saying that THIS is not so great and highly frustrating to deal with. In the first two weeks I found myself submitting the same solution multiple times, altering slight formatting everytime just to get the grade, even though I technically got the answers correct the first time. TL;DR: The course is good, however if you are a true beginner then do expect to be rewatching a lot of the content multiple times, and having frustrating struggles with the automatic grader that makes you want to smash your keyboard everytime you submit the correct code and then receive a 0 because an extra space was added or removed somewhere in your code... With all that being said, I will continue to the rest of the courses in this specialization. Respectfully,Adel ",0,5,Adel Alkhesh,71356098

It will save you from some hell. Also, If you plan to earn (or IMO cheat / fake) just the cert, it will be very easy. You can complete all assignments with no Unity knowledge and only elementary C# knowledge likely you can learn in 1 day even without prior programming experience. Most of what you learn from the course are not in those assignments too.The reason behind this, according to the notes in the non-graded exercises from week 3 and 4, is that the exercises are actually what used to be the assignments. Since those former assignments are not compatible with the course grading system anymore, they were left out as non-graded exercises. You need some extra discipline to learn the real stuff from this course, because the non-graded lectures and exercises are the real deal and I can't say it is paced easy and reasonable enough for someone looking for spoon-fed information. Even if you try to actively read the document, most of the time you will be at 30% understanding what's going on and 70% copying the lecture codes. It will make more sense to you later on! Have faith! (Yes I am speaking to ""two weeks ago"" me)For hard-selling his book: It might seem so at the very beginning of the course. but you don't really need that book to complete the course. Also he's offering a free digital copy so why complain about that lolI agree that the videos would be more useful if there is more screencast than seeing Dr.T shaking his body frequently. Also the in video quizzes could provide some more thought provoking questions than jokes and common-sense questions. That's why it's a 4-stars for me. You can really learn some Unity in this course and IMO it's still better than the famous one from U****(game***.tv), at least it's not putting in tonnes of theory, asking you to memorize all of them while none of them is related to the exercise part (and they don't explain what they are doing). Comparing these two, this course is more like ""you don't immediately understand because Unity is that difficult and a bit overwhelming"", while the game***.tv ones are like ""you don't understand and we are not going to explain as you won't understand afterall"".

In the first two weeks I felt like I was grasping at straws and just plugging in the code without understanding why the code was necessary or what its purpose was, but by the middle of the third week everything made much more sense. I found the description of the course accurate as well, however it was misleading that this is described as a 28 hour course. For individuals who have experience programming this is probably accurate. If you have no experience it will take much longer (I'd estimate it took me about 50 - 70 hours). If I had to offer any recommendations to improve this course I would say that the professor should go over code documentation in greater detail. It would also be beneficial if he would demonstrate how to do certain things on a Mac rather than just using windows the entire time. I have a Mac and although it is very possible to do well in this course with a Mac it does make it more difficult overall. I would also recommend going over the Debugging process in more detail. It is worth noting that the debugging process actually has a bug when using Unity on Mac. Even after setting the breakpoint properly I would receive an error stating ""Could not insert breakpoint at [path to script file]: The breakpoint could not be bound."" Luckily debugging was not essential in order to pass this course, but it did make it more difficult to find out where my mistakes were. Overall I would recommend this course to anyone.

I know Tim is reaching out via the forums for ways to improve it. In theory, having 3 people mark your work is a great idea. However there are no checks or balances. I've submitted a few assignments which meet the requirements and 2 of 3 people gave 4 or 5 marks out of 5 but the last person gives an inexplicable 0 or 1 mark with no feedback as to why they did that.

I have a feeling there aren't many people taking the course, much less activity on the forums since week 1 so there's a chance the students that were there early on either dropped out or lost interest.

The forum is meant for discussions about the course and not to get your assignments graded or use it for personal purposes as such. Due to this, some of our assignments aren't being graded at all (Assignment 4 - ShipBuilding 101 for me).

My level was sufficient to understand all lectures and get highest notes for assignments, but still, I had to read some extra litterature to clarify some moments that professor simply does not explain. So, if you are new to programming, my strong advice will be to get some basics of C# first. Do not be misled by firsts 2 weeks: the content seems to be easy, but starting from there, you will feel the lack of information, and Dr. T's book is not enough to close the gap.

He is also really really good at what he does. I really can't think of a way how he could be any better.Although I think it's a pretty steep course in terms of difficulty, which it should be if you actually wanna learn. This takes you straight into programming, forces you to learn things. I took, and finished, other courses that didn't really teach me much on programming as well. Big difference here.I'm already taking the next course from Dr T.On a whole I can't really give it a higher score. However if I were to add something specific for me it would be more exercises on each part, very simple repeat-challenges just to get the habit of the code and syntax you just learnt into the fingers and backbone.
