However, my biggest issue with the course is the peer review assessment. Since this course is not as popular, I'm still waiting on good grading. Also, someone did grade, but failed me in everything, which is not fair. ",0,0,Zoë Schuijt,119832653

However, I wanted to finish the course as faster as I could to receive my certificate but with final peer review assessment you will need to wait till someone reviews your final assignment. It is not comfortable if you would like to receive your certificate asap.  ",0,0,Kuralay,40036646
