98489000~COURSE!~wIiu6ShLEeabkA6A3tuC4Q,1673800013188,2,0,"I love the project I created with this class but there is one MAJOR flaw : the freaking peer review system. First, the evaluations are often based on wheter the person likes the project, which makes it incredibly subjective and not objective. I mean, some people don't like Star Wars but it was still a huge success. Moreover, the reviewers are often incompetent and make clear mistakes during their evaluation, making us lose points even though we were right. I paid for the monthly subscription and finished the class is less than two weeks, but I will still have to pay for one more month because I haven't receieved all of my grades so this class will end up costing twice as much. YOU NEED TO CHANGE YOUR FREAKING PEER REVIEW SYSTEM, IT DOESN'T WORK!",0,0,Charlotte Poitras,98489000
50609097~COURSE!~wIiu6ShLEeabkA6A3tuC4Q,1602848960092,2,0,"The course meets its goal of getting you to write through a thorough scheduling, that the only thing good of it. Videos from the facilitator are uninformative and spends more time reminding you to review your peers. Last, the peer review system is terrible, as you could spend more time trying to get people to review your work (if there are enough) rather than doing the work itself. This course is great to practice and to develop an idea wit ha schedule to meet deadlines which can be helpful, don't expect anything more. ",0,3,Patrick,50609097
15531361~COURSE!~wIiu6ShLEeabkA6A3tuC4Q,1494656153637,2,0,"The real professor just gives you tips and he is not paying attention to the work of the students. Instead, your work is reviewed by some other random guys who may or may be not prepared to review, if I get to complete this course I'll be getting a certificate not from Michigan State, but from some random guys. No one is reviewing my work despite the fact that I always deliver my assignatures on time and  no one is anwering my questions on the forums. ",0,7,Marco Ceballos,15531361
26809461~COURSE!~wIiu6ShLEeabkA6A3tuC4Q,1498460623710,3,0,"This class really failed to meet my expectations as it did not provide the peer review it implied was the basis of the class.  People would leave no comments, simply check boxes if you had met the basic requirements. The forum was completely inactive, with only comments from earlier course times, so you had to hope your questions had already been answered.  I mean it encouraged me to write but it was a good thing I was already a fairly proficient writer who already knew about screenplays, as the lectures were very watered down as they relied on us learning through peer review that never came.

3234041~COURSE!~wIiu6ShLEeabkA6A3tuC4Q,1610971974059,4,0,"This is not simply a 6-week course. It is, if all one (as a beginner) wishes is to get a feel for what writing Transmedia means, and doesn't care  about seriously digging in depth into it. If all one wants is a little time in a play pen.For beginners (like me) to dig into it in depth, we must do all the research on our own.  The six-week course is a prompt. To get all the work done with depth - that will turn this course into, at least, 6 months. Or six years, depending on what you do besides studying online for this course.For me, it took two years, and it was worth spending that time, and the extra USD 41 to renew the paid enrollment past the free 6 month extension, when I felt sufficiently prepared to complete it. I learned a lot about just about everything this course covers. Besides fiction writing for a novel, all else was new to me - IP, logline, Dramatic Question concepts, character profiling, screenplay writing, game concept and design. I ended up enjoying most what started off as most difficult, screenplay writing (week 4) and game design (week 6 final assignment.)Play pens are marvellous places where to learn a lot :) ",0,2,Maria Joao de Campos Monteiro,3234041

12085810~COURSE!~wIiu6ShLEeabkA6A3tuC4Q,1515403057428,4,0," very concise and straightforward course. However, it would've been better if the instructor or the course was constructed in a way to be more free instead of having to pay for the full course. Also, he did not take into account changing technologies and new media for let's say, video games. In books you can get e-books on iPad or  electronic reader  device. For video games, there is a new virtual-reality goggles technology that has come out changing the way we play videogames and interact with virtual worlds. If this was more updated and taken into account it would have been a more full-fledged course. Might I suggest these changes for the new session? ",0,1,Jonathan Golland,12085810

David's love of writing is evident in how he presents the course materials and objectives.  It's as though he's performing a script from a play; there is drama, emotion, and passion in his speech and movements.  More importantly, what you get from David isn't just meaningful lines from a script but passionate, supportive, and motivational dialog that is uniquely encouraging while pushing you to be the very best that you can be.....Robert Garlington",0,1,Robert Garlington,36716868

If you take the paid course it's helpful in that the instructor gives you guidance and a timeline to keep you motivated. If you audit the class, the videos are still very informative and helpful. The instructor has extensive experience in each media and is very knowledgeable. The only thing that would be even better is additional resources, such as how/where to find Literary Agents, etc. but that would just be a bonus! Great course!",0,2,Tiffany Mettam,31294795
