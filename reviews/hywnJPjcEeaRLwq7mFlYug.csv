If you are looking to learn how to make games in VR, this is not the course for you. This course is intended as a big conclusion project for the VR Specialization by Goldsmith University, and as such, does not contain much theoretical content.Now that this is said, I personally believe it makes a lot of sense to conclude a specialization with this sort of huge wrap up projects. It forces you to reflect on what you have learned so far, and ask yourself the right questions: what do I want to do with these skills? How can I organize a project so that it remains manageable in short period of time? And ideally, it would be so great to make this a community driven course, where all students share projects and feedback, and progress together.Unfortunately, this is not the case. The learning community for this specialization, is non existent, 90% of the students share fake projects, when they are not plagiarized (I've seen 3 or 4 time the Tropical Hidden Forest game, I cannot even tell who plagiarized who + some people don't even bother and copy paste... a wikipedia page!). Reporting them as plagiarism or incomplete does not count in your peer grading requirements, so in the end, out of discourage (and also because I didn't want to pay extra money just to wait for interesting projects to review), I rushed through the grading and asked for review.I have been complaining about the forums in every courses of this specialization (except the first, for which I had not realized how flawed they were), but this is the culmination of frustration: to work this course needs a strong and motivated community. It is not the case. I however believe that this has more to do with Coursera's system than with the lecturers / organizers: people want to rush through the class to get the certificates as soon as possible.Finally, a few words about the course content. I think it is a great idea to have it structured around interviews (my favorite being the 5 part series with Yates Buckley from Unit 9, which is very thorough and go through many aspects of real life vr projects, from 360 videos to vr games). I understand that these interviews cannot be updated frequently, as it requires a lot of work, but I think that after 3-4 years they start to be outdated a bit. However they contain good advices, and they encourage you to get into prototyping your project as soon as possible!I saw someone posting a youtube video of their project, I thought I would do the same. I think I'll continue working on it, even after finishing the class. :)https://youtu.be/UZ13aLx5mj4",0,6,Ian Cherabier,34453037
