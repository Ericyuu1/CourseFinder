However, reading that Fink document was informative. The meditation mindset continued the ""Self indulgence"" mindset and I think it only promoted the person as the ultimate power unto itself, and that causes more short-term thinking and anxiety, simply because Individuals are not ""islands unto themselves"" and dont have the answers. It never promoted God as the ulmiatate source of knowlwedge, and as the fount of Life, as we know it and Jesus as the way, the truth and the life, the way to eternal life.

I am satisfied to the extent that I advised people I taught in testimonial to a master class about CSR to enroll here. I think it unfair to say - as mentioned in another review - that the quality of English could be improved. It is perfectly understandable English, somewhat accented (with various European-like accents), but mostly actually high quality. Be warned that the 80% threshold for passing tests usually means all answers must be right bar one, and sometimes the questions are about something mentioned in passing so you may have to review the lecture.
