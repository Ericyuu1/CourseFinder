111730985~COURSE!~whs-5KrpEeyiqQr1qP1QDw,1666125592531,2,0,"S​TILL needs LOTS of work - ""plays"" like a v1.0 course, and all that this implies: 
- myriad typos (multiple on every page, every question of every quiz) -​ lack of consistency in (brand new) nomenclature; this will be a huge PAIN POINT for all students who are trying to wrap their heads around the new lingo, even while the instructor is using multiple terms DIFFERENTLY or even INTERCHANGEABLY (note: I've kept screenshots, and have several DOZEN to share upon request) -​ an almost complete ignorance of (60 YEARS' WORTH) of existing Control System Theory into which this Autonomous AI 'control theory' simply MUST fit, NOT replace. This results in all the ""theory"" and ""nomenclature"" diagrams coming off as sort of half-baked; they ATTEMPT to resemble rigorous, well-thought-out Control System Theory diagrams, but then you realize they're completely MISSING key components required in EVERY Control System diagram - stuff like the SYSTEM or PLANT itself, so that the resulting diagram simply has MAGICAL ""inputs"" and ""outputs"" without the diagrams actually EXPLAINING FROM WHERE THESE INPUTS & OUTPUTS COME -​ an annoyingly-regular practice of asking QUIZ QUESTIONS about contents that - in fact - was REMOVED from the lesson itself (I have screenshots to prove this statement) T​his course would benefit from a professional instructor re-writing/re-designing the entire course from ground up; as-is it's about 80% ""GREAT"", but the 20% that's missing/confused/intermixed/redefined knocks what could be an A+ can't-wait-for-the-next-lesson course down to the C+ that it deserves as a ""v1.0"" course. 

I predict that - with the right help - by this time next year this course rises up to the A+ it has the POTENTIAL of becoming :-) ",0,0,Mark Vogt,111730985

5137658~COURSE!~whs-5KrpEeyiqQr1qP1QDw,1658327487700,5,0,"In 2014, I took a course in Machine Learning, but could not find any applications for it. Recently, I discovered the course Machine Teaching for Autonomous AI, which fascinated me greatly. Recently, I completed the follow-up course Designing Autonomous AI. It is now clear to me how to apply AI. Kence Anderson is the course instructor, who knows how to captivate me with his lectures. He designed the course and boasts a lot of experience with Autonomous AI. Thank you Kence. I plan to take your remaining two courses as well.",0,0,Rob Bontekoe,5137658

107011355~COURSE!~whs-5KrpEeyiqQr1qP1QDw,1656003432212,5,0,"Excellent course!This course  builds on concepts from Course 1(Machine Teaching) and explains much needed foundational concepts to eventually design a AI Brain. Kence continues to demonstrate his passion through simple examples. The Course will enable you to think how Machine Teaching can be the art of the possible for Industrial day to day solutions and Operation Research based problems with an Open Mind. Thanks to Coursera for providing this platform to enable me to learn.

By the end of this course, you'll know how to ask the righ questions to subject matter experts to fill out the AI specification document for a use case of your choice. The AI spec is an efficent communication tool for all stakeholders including industrial expert operators, business owners and Autonomous AI brain builders.",0,0,Teresa Escrig,10173330
