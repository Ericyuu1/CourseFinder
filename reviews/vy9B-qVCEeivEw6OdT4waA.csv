5591707~COURSE!~vy9B-qVCEeivEw6OdT4waA,1601798612673,5,0,"Great course. It goes from the basics and gradually introduces new concepts. At the beginning of the statistical part, certain knowledge is assumed, especially of regression. I took this course to be able to study the Clinical Prediction Models textbook in detail and I feel that I learned the basic vocabulary and key terms to be able to start studying. Professor Steyerberg's videos and explanations are clear, short, and direct and the effort to simplify a complex subject is appreciated. It is a fully recommended course especially now that many articles with predictive models have begun to appear, many of which lack the essential methodological elements discussed in this course.
