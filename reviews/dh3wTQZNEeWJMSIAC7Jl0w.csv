You can get more in depth information from these said books and research papers, actual peer reviewed data. Not some wishy washy number about creativity increasing after people took this course. We should ask how they came by such data that the course works.Also the dsd's are just ridiculous people do not increase creativity by eating new foods, giving somebody something and doing what you used to do as a child.  Also I think you really cannot gauge the performance of students through the internet. Even if this guy honkason is legit(I researched him and did not find much) the course seems like a total waste of time.Also why am i quizzed on irrelevant  information like where a specific research took place.

The course attempted to encourage participants to ""get out of a normal pattern of thinking to a more challenging pattern"" or what we call it today getting out of the ""comfort zone"". This is true and one would not succeed if he/she doesn't attempt to seek trial and error and participate externally in a fashion that would merge inner thoughts with outward actions. Despite all the aforementioned,  I can not see how turning oneself into deplorable public scenery is a creative thought?Are weird actions and behaviors are now the drives for being creative?The course was designed to invite international participants and therefore must have been prepared better so as to embrace ""International culture"" when accepting images such as eating with a foot, or eating cereals from a bath tab or drinking coffee from it, or standing in a public wearing outfits that are outrageous.  These thoughts might suit some fresh graduates from high schools that are willing to participate because they need to ""experiment"" new approaches to life and bove all pass the curriculum, but certainly not creative for people who take life as a serious gist and an obligation to act as human whilst a life. When one understands the concept of life and the values embedded in life, he/she will attempt to be a useful member and participate in leaving a positive image when his/her time comes to depart this life.

The lecturer kept rephrasing over and over the statement, 'If you are creative than so be it!' There was nothing of a kind of discovery to me. All could be done by doing my own research. Typing errors were frequent and grammar errors, and some videos were really amateourish. Elaborate and outlined instructions on how to critique your peers' work, but when comes to evaluation, it requests only for selecting the multiple choice options. The reading required to pass the quizzes were RIDICULOUS in terms of amount and content, one was a- 22 pages of sweat-work of some self-appointed 'science philosopher' that was so unclear in regards what to focus on, literary merits,  the content synthesis or specific details. REALLY??? So you 'bite through' the reading and you find out that questions are not what you thought they might be. The coursework is not a place for such a lengthy and not too relevant material, it is for home study, to broaden your interest.At one point they ask you to develop your creativity in one of the assignments. But they right away KILL that creativity, by outlining in layman terms HOW to do it, saying COPY this advice and you will be fine, because this is what we want. SERIOUSLY! Week execution, week organization, chaos. For the international students that do not have English language fluency the second reading may be challenging.

There are a lot of creativity techniques out there, but this course only picks mainly two (mindmapping and attribute listing) and those are only a few minutes in the videos. The excercises are interesting, but I never understood why they should be done in public and there is no real explanation. The instructions for the exercises should be more precise - sometimes I was surprised by the criteria (e.g. to provide a 200 words description which never was mentioned before but was part of the grading criteria in week 1). Somehow the course seems to be dead. There seems to be no moderator in the forums. The majority of postings in the forums are ""please review my excercise"" - which I have never seen on another coursera course before in that extend. I myself had issues with getting my submissions graded. The idea is that you get rated by 4 peers, for most of my submissions I only go one single grading. And my last submission I had to submit 3 times because the only guy who rated my work gave me 0 points (the same guy - twice !) as a revenge because i couldn't give him more on his work. I flagged this grading but never got any feedback.Finally the work of my peers that I had to review did in many cases not meet the requirements (e.g. no photos / videos posted, even it was cleary required, and sometimes just a general stuff and not documenting their personal attempt to do the creative task. In many cases I had the impression that students only submit something to get the grading but they didn't really read the instructions or did not put even a little energy to get the task done. So reviewing the work was no fun either and didn't give me any more value. I did a posting in the forum with suggestions to improve the course but there was no feedback at all. So overall: The course is giving some value, but not as much as I expected. There's not a lot activity in the course (with ratings of the exercises and in the forums) and a moderator seems not to be here.

I found the readings to be very insightful along with the supplementary materials (there was a stellar Ted Talk) but some of the videos fell a bit short for me along with some of the activities. I enjoyed the thought and meaning behind the DSD challenges but some of the instructions and encouragement to complete these activities/challenges in public felt odd to me and read more like a sociology 101 course. In the same vein, I think the rolling admittance of an online course like this does not lend itself well to group feedback/discussion time. I didn’t see many people interacting in the discussion sections or providing meaningful feedback so that part felt a bit futile. However, again the ideas behind these DSD challenges were great and I appreciated trying to think of new things to do and ways to be more creative in my own life, changing my habits, etc. I picked up some good tips and tricks in terms of mind mapping and attribute listing which I will definitely use to help me problem solve in the future. So overall, I enjoyed the course and learned new things but it ultimately felt very surface level (which could be very fair considering this was a beginner course) but I wished there had been more personal activities that focused on building and growing my own creativity.

The tone of the speaker had also a huge impact on trying to be creative. Rehearsed lines and a more friendly atmosphere would have improved the atmosphere.

There could have been other ways of generating ideas instead of the DSD's where students are required to upload pictures of them that might be used against them later by attackers to harm their reputation.
