111423873~COURSE!~U9wbh2Q4EeiyMhJxqdQ2EA,1661500127967,1,0,"This course should be removed. The typographical and transcription errors are very many and are often laughable, e.g. Wittgenstein is transcribed as Vic Einstein.  In addition, the pass mark for the quizes is listed as '100% and over'. The course as a whole is a shambles and I can no longer follow it. As a comparison, I took the Relativism course and enjoyed it greatly. It was of a far higher presentational standard than this one and I was delighted to receive my certificate. I had hoped to gain a certificate for this Skepticism course as well but it seems as though I shall just have to say that I have lost my £40 for nothing.",0,0,Lesley Allen,111423873

I really can't fault the way the course is structured or the clarity and quality of the lectures. If I have any worries at all, it's that a lot of the assessment is based on peer marking, which is always likely to create problems, especially with low-traffic courses. However, I experienced no problems in this case. In all, if you're interested in the subject matter as advertised, I can recommend this course to you.",0,1,Russell Blackford,54575637
