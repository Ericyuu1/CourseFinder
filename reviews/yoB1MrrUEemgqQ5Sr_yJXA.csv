123655420~COURSE!~yoB1MrrUEemgqQ5Sr_yJXA,1676027684109,2,0,"• Videos contain somewhat obsolete information.• Little to no practice. A lot of things are mentioned, like volumes and authentication etc., but only mentioned, you won't practice using them.• Trainer just reads text on slides, almost word by word. At some moment you start to suspect that he doesn't even know what he's talking about. A lot of moments when something happens on the slide and it is being explained only in the next module. Instead of givin short well focused info about something you're just being fed with documentation links. If doing so, why even bother to have minikube installation instruction, which is already obsolete, why not give a link like you do for everything here?So, what's the point? With the same success you could superficially read Kuber docs and Learn Kubernetes Basics tutorial and you'll gain same or much better knowledge.",0,0,Denis Rasikhov,123655420

On the plus side the course gives an overview about Kubernetes, but mainly through links and slides, which are simply read word by word through the trainer. Initially I tried to follow allong regarding the examples demoed within the course, but as no sourcecode or example repositories were given reengineering was quite time consuming and frustrating.
