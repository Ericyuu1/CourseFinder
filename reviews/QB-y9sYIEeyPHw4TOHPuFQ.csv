1427998~COURSE!~QB-y9sYIEeyPHw4TOHPuFQ,1673747862813,4,0,"The final course is OK as an overview of advanced features that Armv8-M is capable of, some basic code examples and nothing more than that to learn coding itself. Some parts are presented slightly worse than others but on average it's okay and very valuable.During the specialization I found it fascinating how many things I wasn't aware of. Maybe it was too early for me to learn them because I'm not familiar with assembler and there aren't any practical chapters to gain that knowledge. The specialization gave me a lot of things to further develop during next few months, or maybe years? The documentation and some examples scares me away for now.If you are a professional embedded developer and want to know the Armv8 features here you have all you need.",0,1,Ernest Warzocha,1427998
