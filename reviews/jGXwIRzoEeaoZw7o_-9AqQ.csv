13277552~COURSE!~jGXwIRzoEeaoZw7o_-9AqQ,1660394518411,3,0,too much english given throughout the course. every sentences o nscreen and especially in the resources had english translation with it which takes away from the learning environment. If during the initial conversation and explanation teh course instructor showed the English translation (also in the workbooks) then it would make sense to not give it in the rest of the lesson and also not in the workbook. it would be better to give translation at the end like the vocab so the student neds to actually look and work to find the meaning and threfore learn. The good thing was that very important grammar structures were introduced and explained nicely. i was able to follow along and learn with practice. Module  5 and 6 were great as they were a bit more challenging copared to the the first 4 which had a lot of repitetiin from the First step Korean course offered by Yonsei University as well.The tests: end of module tests were pretty easy to get through and once again there was english everywhere even in the test! there were only 5 questions which was simply there to check that you knew which garmmar structure was introduced rather that proper knowledge of how to use it. Once again i felt that the first step korean course was better organised compared to this although this had a great intro to grammer and vocab. I particular learnt a lot from the conversations at the end of each video.,0,0,Minhal Khan,13277552

There were only two downsides to the Course:1) The ending participles were not too clearly explained so it felt like some were just thrown in to be there. There were not sufficient 'in depth' explanations for persons who are now being introduced to Hangul. It became confusing when the 가/이  and 를/을 were being used. As I realise these particles hold significant weight in the language, an explanation ought to be given in one of the first classes to clear up any confusion which may happen later2.1) The writing of the words: Please space the letters a bit more. It became confusing when reading words and wondering why nouns and verbs were joined, only to realise in later lessons that the words are separate.2.2) Because Hangul has technical pronunciations for persons who non-speakers (learning the language for the first time), it would be advised that a guide of the pronunciation ought to be provided. It became a tad bit confusing when an unfamiliar combination of words/pronunciations was given and it was being pronounced quickly and no guidance was being given on how to pronounce it.

You'll learn only that in this course, in general. What to buy, order. 3) Korea is a high-tech country, and to take the students outside - good idea to see the buildings, nature, and to get some fresh air - bad idea to see how foreign students still misspell very basic words and phrases, and the sound quality is just awful.  And it's like the foreign students have no idea about the tone of such a beautiful language, and it's like they are just saying what they had learned by heart before to record the video. As artists - the same.4) Additional materials are amazing! Thanks for such a great compilation of workbook with what we learned in each lesson. Painful to download and try to find the right lecture materials as the file names are just automatically generated by computer letters and digits. Sure, we could rename each files' name separately by hand - but it has always been easy to download files that ready to go and most importantly - find. P.S. I'm very grateful to watch the lessons from wonderful Sang Mee Han - she is a great person I believe. For the next time, as I hope there will be second course titles as ""Learn To Speak Korean 2"", there will be native speakers with native pronunciation and with good audio quality recorded with professional artists. Sounds impossible, but Korea such a country that will make it possible. ",0,44,albertnikanorov,5519197

The topics of this course is very close to daily life as well as includes essential Korean grammar points. In language specialist's point of view, the lessons are well- designed and easy to understand and catch up. These things are sometimes hard to find in real language teaching center. Big applause for friendly, nice teacher, as well as the lesson contents designer. Well done!A​ bit about my Korean learning process:I​ started learning the Korean alphabet in November, 2021. It took me 2 months (2 days/week) to attend class and memorizes the alphabet and pronunciation principles. Then I continued to take Korean class for beginner, from Jan, 2022 until beginning of April, 2022. I went through all the topics and key grammar point of beginning level, however, I was drown with bulk teaching methods so I was dropped out of the class. Hardly had I memorized anything, then had to move to another topic in blurry mind that ""Is Korean that difficult to learn?"". At the end, the feeling insecurity everytime I go to class and not able to catch up lead me to desicion of quitting that class, haha. Not until August, 2022 I decided to learn Korean again, cause I don't want to waste any of my time and my effort. This time, I chose to learn it myself and I found Coursera. One of my big recommendation of learning language is: a little everyday is way better than bulk learning. Through this course, I can totally control my study. I can stop for studying any object that I found unclear. I wasn't affaid of being unable to catch up as before. Learning by yourself is good for process control, hence it has its drawback, which is there is no one to check your pronunciation. :) Try to read outloud and record it. Listening to your own voice may cause ""self-disgusting"" but it helps, haha. F​inally, the more you're into one language's culture, the better you are at it. Imagine leaning language is like you meet a new friend. If you want to know them better, you have to know their personalities as well as their habits, hobbies, the way they dress, ect, and not just the way they talk :) Work hard, you earn your rewards later. G​ood luck you all. Btw, I'm still learning Korean until now and really enjoy it. Hope I have a chance to visit Korea next year.

I knew previously to enroll how Yonsei University structures its courses, but this one was more likable than the first I took (First Step to Korean). The materials provided were quite useful, specifically the workbook. Love it. Easy and short, but perfect to summarize the lesson. Also, the vocabulary list was superb. The variety of dialogues, scenarios, and accents from the students and professor was useful.If I must complain about something, it would be the briefness of the videos and workbook. If they could extend both, it would be fantastic.A little tip for those who are doubtful to enroll in the course or just as a studying tip for everyone is to record yourself during the pronunciation practice and dialogues. You would learn and practice your speaking, at the same time you will memorize the sentence structure, when, and how to use it.  Another tip would be, make your own sentences taking as reference the ones provided in the videos and workbook. You will play with the words, and structure, making it easier for you to memorize them.I would 100% recommend it. If you know how to write and read Hangeul, some basic concepts of grammar, and a little vocabulary, this course is perfect for you if you want to learn and delve into more grammatical concepts, vocabulary, and everyday conversations. It is perfect for those who just want to review some basic concepts too.And, that's it.",0,0,Sara Martinez devesa,78176140

the material and providing multiple examples on the material covered. I would
take this course again and hope to have Professor Han in future classes.One warning you should
observe before taking this class is this is NOT a beginner’s class. You should have
a basic knowledge of the Korean alphabet and basic words before, or you would have a
hard time following along in latter lessons.",0,3,guy abblorinoo,83601662

The words and sentences structures taught here are great for beginners who are new to korean and teach us the words in situations we'd be likely to encounter as a tourist in Korea. With this course, you learn very useful verbs and words used for shopping, ordering food at restaurants, asking for prices and negotiating prices in stores or in markets, as well as basic things such as talking about your hobbies and the weather. You should definitely keep a notebook to write down the notes, and also look out for useful words in the dialogues at the end of each video, since some words aren't included in the vocabulary list!

The only critique I have is that (like many other courses) the quizes are too easy. A lot of the quizes have the same answer twice.I wish the quizes had more questions and the difficulty of the questions were about the same as the final quiz. I struggled on the final quiz, but I could basically skip a lot of content and still cruise through all the previous quizes.I rushed through the content and the quizes so I am no longer on a timer. To fully benefit from this great course I plan on going back and completing the workbook content that I skipped (every single one). I'm going to give it 5 stars because it's free and a lot of work has been put in, but I do wish it was harder to pass so it was more of an achievement. I should be required to know more than I currently do in order to complete the quizes/weeks. Again, the last quiz is an example of something difficult enough where I'd actually have to complete the week's content to confidently pass. Even just increasing the amount of questions to 15 to 20 would provide a MUCH better representation of how much you've actually learned in that week's content.There may be a reason why there's only 5 questions per quiz. It may be a limitation of Coursera when offering a free course.
