Admin detail: one week between exam-taking after two fails makes no practical sense and is detrimental to the timely completion of the course.
The course would also benefit from an actualization, with more analysis of recent economic & political trends:
- Oil market has historically been cyclical. Need an analysis of past cycles, and a fresh view on whether the current slump is part of a similar cycle, or a new era?
- America's insistence on energy independence, how/why Europe views independence differently, how China/India view their own?
- Current Middle-East politics Iraq-Iran-Saudi-Qatar, historical and current role of Saudi Arabia in the OPEC cartel, and the reality and dynamics of spare capacity within OPEC

I have embarked on this course primarily for my background which is related to the energy industry and also for the joy of learning. This course was peculiar when compared to other similar Coursera courses ( I have done more than 22 courses), for the following reasons: first; students were not allowed to see assignment results, second; Assignments were given two attempts whereas other courses allow 3 attempts, third; students can retake the assignment if not passed the first time after 168 hours, other courses after 8 hours. Despite all these discrepancies, I did not find them very annoying because it makes sense to create some sort of challenge and lift the bar so as to give the course some sort of value. Especially that when courses are made easy, we see the enrollment of low-caliber students who do not mind putting down anything as a contribution and still get away with them, sometimes to the extent the course loses its value and credibility. Despite that, I resent the idea of playing clever in order to make the questions look more difficult, exactly the manner in which the professor of this course has put some of the questions just to make them challenging. It is never difficult to make anybody fail an exam, simply by playing clever. In fact, I can mess around and put a specific clever test question for the professor himself in his field and I will be confident that he will fail the test. Professor Giacomo Luciani might be a good researcher and expert in his field but certainly a failure as a successful teacher. ",0,0,Masoud Habib Ali,40024654
