20343092~COURSE!~BJPOZ3xREeeBZAoxA8giLg,1527574596548,2,0,"Even though pretty much all the courses in the Patient Safety specialization are very informative and up to a certain level that you would expect, the grading system is as such that it depends on peer reviews. This means there is a lack of standard for grading and individuals might come across problems due to this. Especially when on a time limit consider this. Therefore, I find it definitely not worth paying for a subscription and certificate, just do the course a self study and safe yourself a headache!",0,1,K.N. Saha,20343092

There were issues with possible errors within quizzes and a lack of cohesion with the lessons and none of these necessary personnel were available to assist.  Hopefully this will change for future sessions of this course.",0,0,Scherine Campbell,816397
