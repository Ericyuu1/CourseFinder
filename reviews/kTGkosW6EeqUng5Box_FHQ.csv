49910758~COURSE!~kTGkosW6EeqUng5Box_FHQ,1645799542938,2,0,This went through the use of npm way too quickly for a beginning to keep up with. This is supposed to be an introducation to React - it doesn't say you need to know how to use npm. And this doesn't teach one how to use npm. The lecturer just flies through it as though it's common knowlegde. It's not. Very frustrating and disappointing. I think I'm going to give up on this one and look elsewhere for a course on npm because now I'm more confused than ever.,0,0,Carol Pedersen,49910758

From the discussions, many others had the same problem, but there were no instructions on how to resolve the problems.  I spent more time searching the web to find how to resolve the problems than I did on the course.  I finally finished it and did learn.  But it is in bad need of updating.",0,8,Robert Warren,9803334
16232619~COURSE!~kTGkosW6EeqUng5Box_FHQ,1605576499280,2,0,"The information is good, but the Rhyme interface platform is horrible to use. The screen resolution is usually too small to work comfortably. It would be better if you could open independent actual browser windows and not be forced to try to adjust two ""windows"" inside of the same browser window. Sooo much screen real estate is wasted that it's hard to actually work. Would not recommend.",0,1,Angel Martinez,16232619
