I will have to pay 2 months money for just a month worth specialisation, waste! Feels like I've been fooled. It says I'll only need 1 month to complete, then why 2months money? I anyways had to do it due to college requirements. Education turned into a business.",0,0,Yakrita Chauhan,33399871

106616062~COURSE!~cT5NL4ysEeWhEhKsLakOmQ,1676472797724,3,0,"The content of this Capstone is great were it not for the fact that the final grade relies on peer reviews this would get 5/5. However, given the nature of the assignments I don't believe that peer reviews is an appropriate way to grade the final projects. Learners are not taking this seriously and pretty much all of the reviews I did, learners simply uploaded a blank doc or quite literally the assignment instruction sheets that were provided in order to do the task. 

For example, I had a learner do a critique of my slides assignment with feedback that wasn't relevant causing me to have to redo this assignment, then coincidentally since you know who your reviewer was, I ended up having to review someone who also reviewed my course and they didn't even actually do the assignment but are actively critiquing others' assignments who actually put effort into doing this.

The team of instructors came together to weave out a specialization that helped learners (me) to see the importance of each component and how they complement and support each other. I could see they have put in a lot of thoughts in making this MOOC a valuable and effective session for their learners. My review of this specialization is, if you are willing to invest the time and effort, you'll learn or even develop a project that you can use immediately for work or school. Great job Quentin, Dave & William.... and not forgetting the Behind the Scene team Colin & Lisa. I too learned one thing from your professionalism - flex your styles according to your talent, and bring out the best in your work.",0,3,Tong Li Fern,57306203
