18937763~COURSE!~LAsCMVNlEeaLwg5UuE_6KQ,1482709838198,2,0,"Se le da demasiado crédito a Lutero, quien si en algo sobresalió fue en su arrogancia, orgullo y terquedad. ¿Que en la Iglesia Católica había excesos? Sí, igual que los había en el tiempo de San Francisco de Asís, pero el Pobrecillo reforzó la unidad cristiana. Lutero en cambio provocó un cisma, contrariando así el deseo de Nuestro Señor Jesucristo de que todos seamos uno.",0,0,Yolanda C. Lopez Gonzalez,18937763
19640513~COURSE!~LAsCMVNlEeaLwg5UuE_6KQ,1478729449730,2,0,"This course was not overly interesting, it felt more like listening to someone  wanting to paint everything with a socialist brush. I had better things to do. This has not been a class where I learned much. Its structure of super short videos (~4mins) with easy ""tests"" was neither challenging nor useful to confirm the value of the content, in fact a number of tests quiz you on material not yet covered (usually in the next unit). Not the best class there is.",0,1,Jp Chapleau,19640513
23045241~COURSE!~LAsCMVNlEeaLwg5UuE_6KQ,1616029943141,4,0,The only criticism that I have - the importance of the printing press was perhaps under-valued.  In my opinion without the printing press Luther would be unknown  and the reformation would not have happened at that time. ,0,0,Brian Van Hatten,23045241
29097337~COURSE!~LAsCMVNlEeaLwg5UuE_6KQ,1575793216864,4,0,I think this is a very good cours. I learned a lot of details about Luther and his influence on the european history and culture. The only thing that I regret is the lack of response to questions. Maybe this is du to a reduced noumber of participants at this last serie.

94261232~COURSE!~LAsCMVNlEeaLwg5UuE_6KQ,1653402787654,5,0,"Good course. Learned alot, especially about Luther & his contemporaries. Thanks for opportunity. 24 MAY 2022: This course piqued my interest in Luther's publications & commentaries enough to research & read them. Lutheran seminaries still use those texts to train, indoctrinate, & educate their students about Luther & his life, thoughts, & deeds. Although I am not in any way a scholar or a theologian, after reading Luther's diatribes & invectives against the Jews, I came to the conclusion that the only clothing item missing from his wardrobe was a Nazi SS uniform  with the accompanying Swastika accoutrments. He could have easily been a founder of the Nazi Party in the early 20th century. In fact, the ideas he promoted were part & parcel of Nazi theology & policy.His shallow rationalizations for supporting his anti-Jewish views were at best laughable & appear to be there to justify the conflict he seemed to be having between his ""Christian principles"" & his personal twisted beliefs.Again, thanks for the opportunity to further my perspective about this topic.",0,0,RICHARD J YOFFEE,94261232

Dr. Helmer's analysis of Martin Luther in his own time and cultural context would be reason enough to take her course. What follows, from Melanchthon to Kant to Martin Luther King, Jr. and beyond brings the echoes of the hammer blows to the Wittenberg door into sharp focus as they resound today.

4665827~COURSE!~LAsCMVNlEeaLwg5UuE_6KQ,1497623980125,5,0,"I was puzzled by the course at first: the 4-minute lectures, one question quizzes, and initial focus on Nazi use of Luther's antisemitism. But I soon caught the drift of the course's peripateticism: the various historical and doctrinal issues, links to Spinoza, Kant and King, the terrific Luther readings (now I see why the nuns in grammar school warned us against reading anything by Martin Luther) and the many excellent encyclopedia entries (skimmed)--all put Luther and the Reformation in historical and contemporary context. Good job. The 3 paragraph essay was also an excellent teaching device. You asked, 'Do you understand Luther's concept of freedom?' and I had to admit I was befuddled. So the essay and grading others' was spot on. Thanks. Bob Huberty (I met you at the CUNY conference. I was with David Lott, formerly of Fortress Press.)",0,1,Robert Huberty,4665827
