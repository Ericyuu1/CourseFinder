54931526~COURSE!~dIbMFyOhEeuqQApYn6Yorw,1640122256385,1,0,"To preface this, I have completed about 15 courses on Coursera and have a general set of expectations for what a course on this platform should be.

8​0% of the course was talking about what the process is for getting signed up for the CompTIA A+ exam, what to expect during the exam and how to interpret the results of the exam. There is no instruction on any of the material covered by the exam. I have already passed the Network+ and Security+ exams and have been preparing for the A+ for a few weeks. I had hoped to gain more understanding, but the only useful part of this course was getting a baseline for what I need to study based off of the quiz at the end.",0,16,David Armstrong,54931526

Please be advised that this course is designed to give you tips for testing only and does not cover the content of the exam other than the ""top"" objectives that you can obtain for free from the CompTIA website.  Only spend the money if you need help and/or want to get a better understanding of the test itself.  ",0,17,Lewis George,96071595

I'm trying to prepare FOR the exam ... as in study for the the exam... NOT prepare to take the exam as in... ""How do I go about registering for the exam? And how long is it? How much time should I set asisde and how does one even go about taking an exam?"" I doubt there are very many people who could pass the exam but need a course to tell them who they'd go about renewing their certification once it's obtained or need to be quized on how much it costs to RE-certify.",0,10,Malcolm Maddox,76820748

The final practice exams also are unfortunately riddled with spelling and grammar errors that make some questions unintelligible, sometimes the right answer the test is looking for is not one of the offered options, and some questions are just objectively wrong.

86547145~COURSE!~dIbMFyOhEeuqQApYn6Yorw,1626577902470,2,0,I feel that the course would ask questions before the material was introduced. I guess that is good as long as it is not a test. As an instructor I would ask questions knowing that the students had no idea of what the answer was knowing that those questions would be covered in the actual lesson. When it came for test time the students were primed for the test and were successful. In this course it was the opposite. The subject was not even covered until the next lesson.
