The teacher, I think he should explain looking at the student, not at the screen. He speaks like a preacher in church, reading from a predetermined script.

45470415~COURSE!~QgmoVdT2EeSlhSIACx2EBw,1575212065364,3,0,"This course was a little disappointing. There's two problems, I think. First, the course attempts to give a survey of pretty much the whole of astronomy and cosmology in just a few lectures. There's simply too much material to give anything but the most cursory treatment. Second, the presentation style of just reading stuff off powerpoint slides is pretty terrible. There are some equations presented on the slides, by the lecturer neither derives them, nor shows how they can be used to do anything useful. Nor does he really get much into the question of how we know the things we know. Oh and the quizzes aren't very challenging at all.If you're really interested in learning astronomy, the ANU Astrophysics program on edX (https://www.edx.org/xseries/astrophysics) is far superior. The four ANU courses cover almost everything touched on in this course, in much greater depth, and the presenters are way more engaging and entertaining and really give you an idea of how things are discovered in astronomy.

Sometimes it feels like the professor is presenting results at a research conference rather than teaching students with no astronomy background---which can be exciting to watch but it can also be baffling to beginners.

My greatest desire was to become an astronomer. However, I could not become an astronomer. Of course, I'm very sorry. I will be 27 years old, I studied another specialty, but I still can not give up astronomy. I'm still reading, learning, interested. I feel happy with Astronomy and live with its love. I hope that one day I will become an astronomer. One day I will be able to study the information obtained by giant telescopes at the observatory.

I love science because it does not discriminate between people. Even if scientists from different nationalities meet at a conference and do not know each other's language, they will be able to understand each other with the help of a simple mathematical formula. This is the power of science. I know very little English, so I studied the course with subtitles. My physics is weak, but in general I understand Astronomy. This course repeated what I know. It taught me what I did not know. Caltech - Thank you. Thank you both for your progress in Astronomy and for organizing this course. Especially Pr. Thanks to S. George Djorgovsky.

P.S. Sorry for the mistakes in the text.
