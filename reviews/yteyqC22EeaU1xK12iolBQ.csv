The reason is, in my experience,  learners fail to provide any feedback so that one can understand the ""alleged"" errors.  Some learners deduct points without giving any justification nor merely pointing out the alleged mistakes.How am I supposed to submit an assignment again and get a passing grade if I don't even know what mistakes were made in the first place ?    The help center has given the same repetitive, generic answer which is just a diplomatic version of ""not in our scope, suck it up , have a good day and 'happy learning'"".
