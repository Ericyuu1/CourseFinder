12662885~COURSE!~_9izvfVQEee0uQ7YmQ7_mg,1652620419886,1,0,"When I got down to the course 4, I completely collapsed as it almost had nothing to do with ""reinforcement learning"". The lectures almost have nothing to do with the core of this specializaiton ""reinforcement learning"". The project has nothing to do with Reinforcement learning, it is to use MLE to estimate parameters of a model proposed in the paper of the instructor. I am really pissed off by taking this specialization. I thought I would learn something, but it turened out a complete waste of my one-month time. BTW, if you wanted to learn quantum mechanics, this is the course. ",0,4,Yi Wang,12662885
12370448~COURSE!~_9izvfVQEee0uQ7YmQ7_mg,1584403390359,1,0,Never have wasted my time on anything as useless as this one! If I wanted to go read the book to learn and take the exam I wouldn't need you. Just don't take this course Or any of the courses on this specialization.,0,5,Ehsan Fathi,12370448

16594197~COURSE!~_9izvfVQEee0uQ7YmQ7_mg,1585429597340,2,0,"Contents of Week1 and Week4 are really useful, as the instructor recommended several academic papers on relevant topics. However the instructor failed to expand them, at least will be helpful to outline the basic ideas of each paper. The instructor only mentioned the authors' names and paper title. It's a pity. However, week 2 and week 3 are totally useless in understanding finance and reinforcement learning. It's just a pile of formulas from physics, not interesting or pertinent to course topic at all. Moreover there is a strange signal term in the drift of stochastic process. I don't think anyone in industry is ever using this less-known dynamic to pricing or trading.It's definitely better that Week2 and Week3 could be removed completely and be replaced by expansions of the academic papers that the instructor recommended.

Uses lot of  unnecessary history, symbols and equations to explain simple concepts. Overall it is a good overview of the big picture of RL in finance provided  if u can withstand the assault of excessive mindless symbols and equations. ",0,1,Kenneth Nicholaus,27567117
