6612523~COURSE!~GNr7-GFfEeW5iQpSR8Sfhw,1481859296130,2,0,"This course is not terrible, I learned a few things, but it is poorly designed.Some things are explained as if to people who aren't familiar with the concepts at all, while others are explained as if to people who must already know a lot about the concepts.  I often felt lost.  The ""quizzes"" did not help, you could do well on them without actually understanding things (I remember one multiple-choice question where the options were something like (a) ""Arrhenius's first law"", (b) ""Arrhenius's second law"", (c) ""Arrhenius's third law"", and you didn't even have to look at the question or know what the law was to know the answer because only one of Arrhenius's laws had been mentioned in the course at all).There are two types of videos in this course.  In one type, the professor is in a lab or kitchen or classroom or something and is physically demonstrating things.  These videos are useful and mostly understandable.  The other type of videos are lecture-style things that appear to have literally been sliced out of some other more thorough set of videos - sometimes the professor refers back to ""earlier"" parts of the lecture that we haven't actually seen before.  Concepts and variables are often introduced without even mentioning what they refer to.",0,9,Avril Kenney,6612523

1526000~COURSE!~GNr7-GFfEeW5iQpSR8Sfhw,1630519362183,3,0,"W​ith a title like 'ten things every engineer should know' I expected a bit more 'sazz' / pop delivery than this course delivered. Most of the subjects were discussed very well and concisely, but I'd like more examples and visuals. What it lacks in examples it makes up for in conciseness and the instructor is clearly very experienced. All in all a good little course, and I recommend it.You have to do a few exercises and rub off the old algebra but which is otherwise very quick and straightforward. But pay attention or you may just miss the quick half sentence that's used on a test. I​ have had some mechanical engineering courses and knew about a third of what the course taught, but it was a long time ago so the brush up was well worth it. I learned a lot from this course, especially about the relationship between the microstructure and macro behaviour of metals (this course is 90% about metals), and the ubiquitous relationship between temperature and chemical reactions of all sorts. E​ngineering knowledge needs most of all to be practical and actionable. This course makes that a little too hard I think, and the dry, graph-heavy form really isn't suited to giving a conceptual overview for engineers. That's my only gripe with the course – that the material is dense and obtuse, and we are shown graphs to try to understand behavior of nature and systems. I had to stop the course many times to try and make sense of the graphs. There are so many powerful examples to draw from to anchor the teaching in the concrete. You have a screen to show, show some examples.  The few ones that are used are terrific, and really help elevate the course.Oh, yeah, a second gripe – t​he last 'thing' is about semiconductors and a good idea. But it was completely unactionable. Bewilderingly, we are told that doping semiconductors increases their conductivity at low temperatures, however, such doping is temporary as the dopant is exhausted. I have almost no answers from that and so many questions. What temperature range are we talking about where dopants are useful? How useful? How long does the dopants last? What other types of dopants are used? Why are semiconductors uniquely good for electronics? I get that that is a huge topic, but this covering of semiconductors didn't even give me an idea of how the semiconductor is produced, or how much dopant is typically used, or what they look like.",0,0,Stian Nielsen-Man,1526000

Toastmasters will teach you to be more concise in your descriptions and to eliminate crutch words such as ""uh"", ""um"", etc.  These little things add up as distractions from the subject.

have population of nearly 76,000 in Tamilnadu,India.I'm from middle class
family having 3 elder sisters.Since my father got low wages which only fits for that
day as tomorrow becomes big ?.I have dream or ambition of being a doctor but
which is just a morning dream for my status.As i grew,my father got good
respected position in our township and some what wealthy than before.I was so
excited of being doctor.But i got low cut-off for presuming doctor.So its impossible to
come in scholarship and through management or private institution,the price for
single seat without any recommendation is around 90 lakhs which is just for
seat,where study materials and hostel fee are separate which is main reason for
un-development of my nation in large scale.So i was pushed to join in
engineering college.At institution,i got knowledge but not in amount i excepted.At
that time,i come to know about COURSEA and their free cost education of all
streams.Then i enrolled in our community and Since i was longed to be doctor i
liked to choose biological study and that's the way i got to you..Proverb says that ""THOUSAND MILES OF JOURNEY STARTS WITH
SINGLE STEPS"" .If the first step becomes wrong,the journey is
impossible.I'm lucky in that way as i got my first step as massive one.you made
my day madam.you gave me knowledge and interest of being a wanter. Now i can
proudly says , I got 3 certificate through COURSEA only due to you.It's not just for thanks giving ,i just like to share my
feelings and says that like there are more than

24516543~COURSE!~GNr7-GFfEeW5iQpSR8Sfhw,1496169025065,5,0,The general contents of the course are very satisfying. The connections between units (i.e. things) are very good and consecutive. Each topic has a connection with at least another one. Everything starts with Arrhenius and ends with Arrhenius. I appreciate Prof. James Shackelford for establishing such a connection throughout the course which makes whole subject fully understandable. However there were some numerical problems on some quiz of things (units). These numerical problems are so simple but there were not any example that shows the method how to interpret these problems to solve though. The trainee is supposed to solve these problems from the given equations. But it is sometimes hard to realize how to use the formula practically if one is not directly working on this specific subject. The other thing is about the semiconductor subject in where the n doped extrinsic semiconductors and the donor electrons with the energy level close to the conduction band are explained very good. Whereas there is no information about the p doped extrinsic sc's and acceptor holes  with the energy level close to the valance band. Of course this course is about the material science and does not contain the electronics subject which is related with the electron flow under certain electric field. But I wish I saw the p-n junction with associated Fermi diagrams and  how it shows the valve characteristics to the electrons under certain conditions of electric field. But anyway I got so many things that I need and I appreciate for these. ,0,2,Ismail Hakki Batum,24516543
