Looking through the course chat there are months-to-years-old posts pleading for reviews by poor souls who cannot get their certificates because they have yet to receive the required four reviews.This one-star review is not for the content or presentation or quizzes, which are otherwise five-star, but for the simple fact that the evidenciary certificate that so many of us came here to get is locked behind a poorly planned and ironically unethical peer review system that was clearly not thought out before it was implemented.",0,1,Chris Volion,121171271

The professor was very good, but, even if you complete all assignments, your certification and grade depends upon having others in the course go in and review your assignment.  Even if you review more than you are required to review, if others don't review yours, you don't pass or get your certification.  So, be aware of that if you are attending a class in the hopes of obtaining a certification.  It is not guaranteed even if you do all of the work. ",0,6,Katherine Schulze,28483863
17259917~COURSE!~H0QlQ4hFEeepbRJnqPie6A,1521924785771,2,0,"I've been disappointed with the course overall. it's a very interesting topic, one that's relevant to the times we live in. But I feel that many of the big questions are neither asked nor answered in the course. The presenter's background is in engineering, not philosophy. This isn't a fundamental problem in itself, but it does mean that concepts are left very vaguely defined. So 'ethics' is, at one point, defined more or less as 'what's socially agreed-up'. But in the questions as well as the videos, the terminology shifts between 'ethically right/wrong', 'appropriate', 'have to do something,' 'by rights', 'legally', and lots more besides. So it's far from clear what the right or wrong position might be in many of the thought-experiments described in the quiz questions. What's more, if an action isn't in itself ethically right, that doesn't entail that it must be ethically wrong: it could be neither. There's virtually no input from other voices, too: no discussions with, say, experts in the field of data ethics, or moral philosophers, or whatever. At one point in week 1, the presenter correctly points out that ''data ownership is really complex''. So it'd be useful to have a MOOC that makes it less complex: that asks hard questions, and critically examines the range of possible answers. Unfortunately, this MOOC isn't it. ",0,8,Daithi M.

In particular, the instructor frequently equated ethical behavior with socially acceptable behavior (this activity by corporation x was unethical because it resulted in public outcry).  Someone with a background in ethics really should have been consulted in course developement.  On a  purely practical matter, the ta did not seem to have any training in ethics at all.
