77545883~COURSE!~oF9eci9-Eem6mRKjkIsR2A,1623865625896,2,0,"I liked the idea of this course, but it was hard for me to get into it because the first week is all over the place. It is too much information and needs to be narrowed down/ refocused. I think a restructuring of the course to make the topics introduced in the 1st week  the overall weekly topics of this course would make it more palatable and easier to follow. The content is interesting (I did enjoy the section  pertaining to the herbarium), but it is just too much information. Because of this, I have decided not to complete the course.",0,0,Melanie Wagner,77545883

The team was very professional and have knowledge in the different areas offered. I would love to have this course offered in Spanish, because the team is more comfortable in that language (and the automatic transcription is not very accurate). As a Spanish speaker, I understood most of these non accurate words, but non-Spanish speakers probably will find it a little bit more difficult. Please revise the transcription and also revise the links for further information. Some of them have not been actualized.",0,0,Ana Luisa Roque Valdovinos,20340217
