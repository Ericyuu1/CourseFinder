76281122~COURSE!~63c2BaTcEeqCThLuK6aAqQ,1607606389195,4,0,Very interesting course.  Not a lot of it was entirely new to me but it was good to have different aspects of the patient perspective brought together and the links to other concepts (like patient-centred medicines and polypharmacy) clarified.  The demands of the course were just about right.  Sufficient to feel one had done a proper course but not so demanding as to make it unmanageable with everything else going on.  ,0,0,Colin Bradley,76281122
