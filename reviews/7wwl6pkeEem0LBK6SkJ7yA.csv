The good side of each of these courses:
* The courses cover the main concepts (building models, limitations, challenges, etc). They covered activation functions, Convolutions, width and depth of models, Gradient Descent and learning rate issues. * The lessons don't oversimplify, but give you the tools you need to explore further on your own if you wish. * Replies to my forum questions were actually surprisingly quickly answered. I was expecting the forums to be filled with months-old unanswered questions.* Being able to replay videos was invaluable. The less-good side:* The exams are token, often multiple choice with unlimited retries. That is fine.  * The lessons are often replete with misspellings,  grammar errors and ambiguous quiz questions. * Sometimes, due to the stochastic nature of ML models, the errors/mispredictions differ between the Grading Rubrics and legitimately obtained results. Would I do it again? My answer is this- I feel for six courses I have the equivalent of one junior-level semester survey course's worth of information and experience. However I was able to do it on my own time starting immediately, at my own pace, replaying the lectures at will and all for a tiny fraction of the cost and time of a college course.
