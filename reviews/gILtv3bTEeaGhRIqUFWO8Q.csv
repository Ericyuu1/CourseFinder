109073409~COURSE!~gILtv3bTEeaGhRIqUFWO8Q,1657861149337,1,0,"我是课程会员，在我们完成了课程后，会发现自己无法获得证明自己成绩的课程证书，因为没有人给你的互评作业评分，我想这是学习课程的人比较少导致的，这是一个恶性循环，因为他存在的问题，会让更多人不愿意去学习并参与它的考试，因为我们的努力无法得到证明。I'm a member of the course. After we finish the course, we will find that we can't get the course certificate to prove our grades, because no one gives you a grade for your mutual evaluation homework. I think this is caused by fewer people studying the course. This is a vicious circle. Because of his problems, more people will be unwilling to study and participate in its exams, because our efforts can't be proved.同学互评等待时间有点久",0,0,Geye Gu,109073409

39347334~COURSE!~gILtv3bTEeaGhRIqUFWO8Q,1642431040913,3,0,"While the course materials seem sufficient for the level, the organization is lacking. Specifically, the grading method in which you must review peers to get your own grade. This creates two issues: first, it restricts how quickly you can finish the course, and second, it seems that peers are grading the most important section of the course. After several messages to admin about needing more assignments to review just to get my own grade, I would not recommend this type of system without a backup grading method.",0,0,L.
