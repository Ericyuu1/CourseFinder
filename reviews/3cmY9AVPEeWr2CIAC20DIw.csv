60229891~COURSE!~3cmY9AVPEeWr2CIAC20DIw,1598116576295,4,0,"  I took this course to suppliment Professor Paul Bloom's course ""Moralities of Everyday Life."" That was an entertaining course, and Professor Bloom spoke of Peter Singer as having a massive influence on his ideas, so I chose to check this one out to see what it's about.I'm grateful for ""Effective Altruism"" course because it shined light on some important considerations that are often overlooked when deciding how to give charity. It was eye-opening and counter-cultural. He does not tell us ""follow your heart to do the most good."" Proffesor Singer also does not believe that empathy and seeing the people you help as individuals is necessary to do good. Instead, he believes that it is our duty to try to do what will bring the most benefit to the most people.I can see how some people might be put off by the dispassionate nature of this course's content. The ""effective"" in ""effective altruism"" is key here. If you want guidance into what charities will produce the best results, this is for you; if you are looking for guidance into how to love others indiscriminately and find the drive to work towards it in your life, I would instead recommend the course ""Love as a Force for Social Justice"" from Stanford.There was some discussion of the philosophy behind altrusim and morality, but this was an overall practical class. Professor Singer's brought in real life examples of people who engage in effective altrusim, and he introduced certain charities and organizations to us to learn how they operate behind the scenes. In the former cases, the lectures appeared to be recorded in his actual classes he taught, so a ""live"" Q&A was possible between the students and the guests.There are many information-packed reading suggestions, although reading is not required to get the course certificate. Some of the articles were easy to access online. Others, it appeared the only way to get them was in print. They were packed with facts and opinions. Although I finished the course, I'm still trying to read through all these interesting and pertinent articles.Taken as a whole, it was thought-provoking and undeniably vital in developing my strategy for how I donate to charities. However, are certain cardinal assumptions that I felt may have been overstated and simplistically presented. For example, overwhelming, the focus was on developing countries' plights (e.g. malaria, HIV/Aids, undernourishment), ""effective"" often seemed implicitly defined by ""the number of lives saved"" not improved, and the gain versus cost monetary-wise was the way that it was measured. This rubbed me the wrong way as a sustainability major; when the focus was on saving the most lives possible immediately and solely through how money is spent, it seemed to make sacrifices in other important areas- resource allocation, nested power struggles, and soil health to name a few- for fighting poverty.This is certainly a great course to begin learning about the steps you can take towards effective altruism, but it is also not an end point. The ideas presented here for making the greatest impact are just that- opinions and ideas. Use the tools and knowledge and experience and skills you have in addition to the suggestions and resources in this course to decide how you will engage in ""effective altruism.""Thank you for taking the time to create this, Professor Singer and all that took part.

9690684~COURSE!~3cmY9AVPEeWr2CIAC20DIw,1593292680783,4,0,"I learned about a few very valuable organizations to efficiently maximize the effectiveness of your donations.  I will go back thru notes to select the best.  For me 1/4 of the course was 5+, as the essential need to give and most effective ways.  Would have liked more ways to evaluate causes that interest you, even if not the ""best"" use of your donations (helping people become more independent, educated, reduce slavery, sex trade & abuse, rather than ""just"" focus on saving lives.  Some harshness, but truth to Professor's Singer's belief: If you know about the problems you are obligated to help.  So many are ""blissfully"" ignorant, or self-deluded by what difference can I make with the Gates Foundation & others barely making a dent.  Some of my wanting to get to just the nuggets (best websites to gauge effectiveness of charities (vs administration costs) and ""best charities"" is because I'm retired & would like to both help while I can, but hopefully inspire my grand-kids to both know about poverty and violations of human rights, but feel that they can make a difference and to feel good about doing what they can.",0,4,David Woods,9690684

I understand that it is called effective altruism, and not simply ethics, but I do believe that convincing me of your philosophy does necessitate both a more careful rejection of the others, as well as developing all of the arguments in sufficient detail. This was actually a reason why I left the course early on, but then decided to re-enroll -- to let Prof. Singer have a chance at presenting his own argument in a more complete manner.The course is necessary. I agree with Prof. Singer's observation that consumerism has insufficient meaning for many, and that by trying to live more ethically, we can give meaning to, or discover meaning in our own lives.I could not justify giving any fewer than four stars because clearly the course content is above average. Prof. Singer is passionate about the cause, is earnestly trying to build a community around it, and this shows in the content.
