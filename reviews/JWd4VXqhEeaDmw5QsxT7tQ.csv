Indeed, only one assignment was peer reviewed, and a peer, although nice and supportive, will not push you to expand your knowledge and improve on your thinking.  Also, it was not easy to find the peer reviews. It would be great if they arrived in your mailbox as soon as done... instead, I had to wait, and then find my way back to the assignment at the end of the course, and discover that, yes, I had been peer reviewed. I am not sure whether any one has left any 'upvote' or 'comment' on the other submissions I have given via the discussion forums. It would be too time consuming to check them all. Again, it would be nice to have one place were all your assignments and submissions and their feedback is gathered (rather than stroll through pages and pages of discussions). Or may be this exists but I do not know about it? Another point: I do not know if the two peer reviewers were other students or staff members (I saw that there were moderators for the course). It would be nice to know.   Last point: in the tests, it would be nice to know if several answers are possible rather than just one, as I often got caught having only one good answer while there were 2 expected. I guess I just picked the best one and did not realise I could add more...Thank you for reading! I am looking forward to the next class. ",0,0,Karine CHAGNE,78081596

The visionary part starts with Professor Seligman's revolutionary insight into the inherent negativity bias of 20th Century institutional psychology. If you imagine a state of ""normal,"" ""disease-free,"" or ""healthy"" as the the objective, much of psychology was about getting people from a state of below-the-goal to the the goal. Seligman asked the question, what about ""better than normal?"" He revisualized the spectrum as encompassing more than zero and negative numbers, including the entire range of positive outcomes as well. How can healthy people improve their mental health, resilience, disease resistance and flourishing? How can we shift the whole curve so that everyone is happier and healthier and fewer people fall into illness? How can we apply a rigorous and empirical scientific method to these questions which have interested philosopher, wise people, and spiritual leaders down through the ages? You will learn much more than the big picture here. You'll take away life-changing, research-tested and proven skills. Great course!",0,0,Mark DiMassimo,45294687

I understand the importance of helping clients via a focus on what positives she or he has and others positives can beI developed.  I've run some marathons, and found  that I just need to keep on running, no matter how many may pass me in the process.   When you run under the 26.2 mile finish line. the rest of the race, being passed, etc.. becomes less important.  There is the story of a boy trying to toss a baseball up in the air and hit it with his bat.  The boy keeps tossing it up, albeit, missing the ball.  Rather than pessimism and failure, he proudly says aloud, ""What a great pitcher I am!""  My clients often focus on mistakes,  failures, other people's comments about them - including family.  I love positive psychology.  Could not agree more that the focus must be on our positives. versus trying overcome our shortcomings!  That is my focus as a psychologist.  Dr. Seligman has developed an extremely important way of looking at things.  I also like Behavioral Activation Therapy (not behavior therapy).  Rather than focusing on the downside,  behavioral activation assigns the client to go do X, Y, Z - of his or her choosing, as long as it is healthy and positive.   Example,, a depressed person can focus on being depressed, isolated from other, lack of positive experiences.  But the depressed person very often decides to not go to the friends birthday party, and shuts him or herself in their room - all alone.  Behavioral Activation - assigns them to go anyway.  Being home alone in one's room make depression worse. going  anything (unless it is a mean group of peers, who tend to ridicule him or her - if so -- the goal is to find those who are not like that).  Yet CBT (a very good therapy) is often shoved to the head of the line.  I strongly recommend Behavioral Activation Therapy, which is a key treatment at an inpatient center in Wisconsin.
