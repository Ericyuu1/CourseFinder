8661294~COURSE!~btJvmOw4EeqvJAoWlWafpw,1617394435398,5,0,"I am a non-specialist taking this course simply for interest, and so have not done an upgrade. Nevertheless it has been extremely interesting, both in the lectures by Professor Ellen Hillbom and in the freely available PDF course material.  The presentation is unspectacular, but that puts a better emphasis on understanding the contents covered - less dazzling viewing but more thinking.  I feel I have learned a lot and am very grateful to Lund University for making this course available to the public through Coursera.  ",0,3,Margaret Curran,8661294
