The exams - I'm doing everything is possible during the course, I'm taking notes, reading all the required reading materials, etc. and still, in the exams I get questions that are not related at all to what I've learned, some of them were never in the course content, some of them are more matter of opinion, but you will still fail the exam if you get the wrong, this + the fact that the exams in this specific course require a very high score to pass + when you fail you cannot see where you were wrong = recipe for disaster. I'm just guessing time after time in order just to pass the exam, not useful at all for studying, and mostly annoying.Now multiple this by 6 exams...b. The Peer to Peer Assignments - they require a terrible high grade, nearly perfect, which basically means that if 1 peer gave you a low rank on 1 parameter, you fail it and need to start it over and wait again to all the peers to score it (which sometimes can take more than a week). This will make sure you will not finish this course fast, and you find yourself doing the same works again and again.c. The reading materials - they are generally good, and I've read them all so far, BUT, there are too many of them. For each week (there are 6 weeks) you have enough ""required content"" for hours of reading, I've never seen that much required reading from external websites in other sources, another problem with this is that many of these reading sources won't let you read too much before they ask you to pay in order to continue reading, again, not the most useful thing for learning (instead I would expect this course to provide it's own reading sources, free to the students, and only relevant to the content of this course).Bottom line - this course could have been a great course thanks to it's great content.BUT ""thanks"" to the issues I raised above, this course will mostly make sure you will go bananas before you finish it.I'm currently trying to finish it for 3 months without success.",0,15,Jonathan Oshri Davis,34385323

5407531~COURSE!~fM5baJoUEeW93wo8Ha4kow,1665418371400,2,0,"T​he course began with suggestions for best practices regarding time mgmt and module transition.  It implied that the course could be completed with a minimum of study two days a week. It is a non-credited introductory course, as most MOOCs are. I like to complete MOOCs in 1/2 the given time if possible, so I planned for 4 days of study and committed for 3 days. I've taken a number of MOOCs over the years. This was the 1st that would be tracking my own use of my time. I soon found out why.In the 1st hour I followed the projected times given for each individual step and divided the elements by 3 days. I had planned for a couple of hours of study on Sunday for my review before taking the mandatory quiz. That was mistake number one. I ended up spending a fruitless 15 hours on Sunday, unable to locate required reading material that I only found out about, listed near the end of my last day of study in the 1st week.Leiden University also offered free membership to join the LSA, the Linguistic Society of America, no less, which provided world statistical demographics for the most active languages as well as those that were on their way out, were losing favor or had become extinct. I filled out the application for membership and set it aside until I could evaluate the different tiers of membership. It was clear to me this was probably not a free site for anyone with real academic credentials, so I approached joining the society carefully.  That was mistake number two. When I returned to joining it a day or two later I was denied access, stating my free membership had been voided under suspicion of my trying to establish two free memberships. I cannot tell you how funny I found that, given at the time I was reading about Labov and the covert methods he suggested to be used to spy on socially deprived groups in order to best conduct his research. T​here's more but it's no longer important. I can't register with the LSA because my degrees come from the University of Massachusetts, the University of Maine and Norwich University in Vermont, and none are listed on the society's application for membership. I ended up on Sunday thinking I was well ahead of the course's requirements, when I ran into the required reading list which also included articles from the BBC's nature programs. Several of their animal and nature series were given as required reading, but on Sunday morning, my last projected day of core studies. I tried signing on and joined, and my BBC subscriptions were confirmed by email, however, I couldn't get past the home page of their three different nature websites or locate either of these stories. I tried thru both You Tube and Spotify where I have held active subscriptions for years. Needless to say, most of the questions on the quiz were from these websites, the LSA site and the BBC sites. A​s a last ditch effort I went through Leiden University's MA Linguistics course offerings to decide if it would be worth it to take an online MA, and I couldn't find a single one listed online. They appear to all require residence in the NL. I realize as far as the MOOC goes it's not the end of the world and I can still get past these hiccups, but hey, I'n 78 yrs old. I'm already in the same shute along with those languages which are down to their last speakers. The University of Maine has a Linguistics MA and it's tuition-free for Maine seniors.

25880238~COURSE!~fM5baJoUEeW93wo8Ha4kow,1497861824020,2,0,"Professor Marc van Oostendorp has woven a lovely and living web of an introduction/refresher to Linguistics for anyone with the beginning of a serious interest. His enthusiasm and outright love of the discipline are infectious and are filtered by an evident and generous humanity.  This works especially well in his choice of guest speakers who are without exception a joy to hear.  He ties it all together at the end with William Labov's wonderful retrospective, showing the student that one doesn't have to be a follower of a particular school of thought to appreciate how its proponents generously pour their discipline, experience, skills, love and humanity into what they are doing.  In so doing they, as well as the good Professor, share the essential lesson:  approach language with all the scientific discipline you can muster but always keep in mind that it is something human, mysterious and very much alive, and always changing.  Something that cannot be caged.Why only two stars? One star off for each of the following:First, it is too light and the required readings too short and too easy.  Furthermore, there is an over focus on certain topics, especially politeness theory and speech errors, which doesn't really go anywhere.  Other topics, such as approaches to syntactical analysis, cognitive linguistics, etc. could well be further explored.Next, the structure of student participation should be enhanced to require much more lateral work (of better quality) among and between students currently taking the course.  Much of the recent input was appallingly poor, leaving one with the impression that participants where just ticking boxes.  Finally, and most importantly, is the failure of the course on this commercial platform.  The student receives many emails urging the purchase of a certificate or of other courses, but the course itself is not kept properly updated.  It contains many errors that have not been corrected for quite some time.  Most are not very important, but some, including a few patently incorrect quiz and exam answers (which have been cited and admitted in the Forum but not changed), are important.  The student has, in effect, no way to check where s/he might have gone wrong.  The student gets no up-to-date feedback.    The course was free, a kind of teaser for the commercial product, but that gives Coursera all the more reason to keep it updated, to keep on improving it.  One gets the impression, as things now stand, that Coursera cares about the money a little too much.  That it has  missed the balance between the search for profit and the search for meaning.  Coursera is letting this course, a lovely living thing, slowly die on the vine.Jack Kennedy",0,25,Jack Kennedy,25880238

The course really gives you a very basic look at linguistics, showcasing its primary building blocks. I have learned a lot! Thank you everyone for your work! I do understand it's hard to squeeze all the linguistic essentials in the 6-week timespan, so the course creators relied on the students' autonomy greatly. But sometimes, the amount of required reading was just overwhelming. Also, I had a feeling that the course content and the tests were created by separate people, as it took me great pains to connect the dots between the relevance of the test questions and the material learned. This course demands strong analytical skills, so if you're not used to reading and understanding the scientific content on-the-spot, prepare for multiple re-reading.

It's difficult to cover everything in such a short course. The last two weeks'

these things are common to all languages. 
I would have preferred to concentrate more on firs 4 weeks topics. This
all stuff with politeness does not fit much in the topic. It's more
sociolinguistics, cultural studies etc. And there is not much to learn. There
is no much valuable information to remember. I liked more the beginning about
sounds, typology of languages etc. This all stuff with positive and negative
face was a little strange. Specially, it was difficult to do the tests with
these ""faces"". Listening exercises were quite OK, but for instance to
decode Chinese without transcription was impossible task. All these exercises
with language mistakes was also strange. If we all do pronunciation mistakes in
all languages what’s the point to study these mistakes? What's the point to see
what mistake is made in Basque, Gungbe or any other language? I saw this exercise
as pure waste of my time. So, my general suggestion would be to concentrate on
pure linguistic things (first 4 weeks) and do not go into field of sociology,
neuro or psycholinguistics. BTW this couple of students is not balanced because

The presentation style was really engaging as Maarten interacts with Martin, Inge and guests. The downloadable lecture transcripts were fantastic. That said, I have a few suggestions:1) Include more free online resources. Most the background reading material were Amazon books, which are expensive if you come from a country with a weak currency. On the practical note, most telelearners like myself don't have time to read an entire book. It would have been far better to include journeys. 2) If students want to do the honours course, allow them to study on a different academic schedule. I found it impossible to complete research assignments and tests at the same. 3) A few assessment questions were poorly phrased and this leads to confusion on the single and multiple select quizzes.4) Commenting and replying to questions wasn't that interactive. Hoping that somebody would randomly reply or comment to your answer was frustrating. If we were paired up with online study partners, we could discuss topics together.  5)Lastly, fix for typos on course material and tests.

I never knew language could itself be studied like a science, even though it's not a law of nature like gravity. Prof Oostendorp does a fabulous job of giving you multiple perspectives of looking at language - as a social tool, as a lens into the world, as a scientific object to be studied, as an experience in the brain, what different experts say about it and finally what are the various states of endangerment/prosperity in which many real-world languages exist. The grad students (Marten and Inge) did a nice job of preempting the questions we would've had during the lecture. And of course, playing around with Ethnologue and listening to the language informants (6 beautiful languages from 6 parts of the world) were the cherry on the top. Overall, an incredible experience.
