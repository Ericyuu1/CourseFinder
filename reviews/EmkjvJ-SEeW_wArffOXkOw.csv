The one thing about the course that needs addressing is that someone who knows the field needs to proofread the transcripts. I don't know if they were created by a transcriber or by computer, or some combination, but some curious things appeared. The funniest was ""gene irritability"" rather than ""gene heritability."" The word ""elicit"" was replaced often by ""illicit,"" which in context made no sense. I first went through each transcript and edited out the goofy transcribing before listening to the lectures and following along in the transcript.  I wondered how confusing the transcripts would be, therefore, to those for whom English is not a primary language. The transcription errors SHOULD BE FIXED, for the sake of those students.
