18048333~COURSE!~zLUyvUR4EeaDRhLb8lAaNw,1566299200107,4,0,"Very good course.  The topics are interesting and relevant to anyone who wants to learn more about development, specifically about data science tools. The courses do require a lot of outside reading and research to complete the assignments though.  While this likely mimics what one face in the day-to-day world on the job, there is an opportunity to fold more of this material into the course material itself.  Overall, strongly recommend.

It's justly designed to be challenging enough, but not too burdensome. This certification provides all the building blocks of data analysis and software development in R, data presentation and packaging for distribution and collaborative works. If combined with another certification in data science and machine learning, they would make a formidable offering to any candidate who wish to try a career in data science/data analysis field. Thank you Coursera, Roger and Brooke.",0,0,Sandjaja Budiman,30399415
