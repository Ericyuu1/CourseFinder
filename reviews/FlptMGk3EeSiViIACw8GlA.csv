50603160~COURSE!~FlptMGk3EeSiViIACw8GlA,1586531126483,2,0,"The class is interesting, but the main problem with the assignments is that you have people with little to no experience that end up reviewing your work every single time.For instance for the second week's drawing assignment, a lot of people who didn't have talent or knowledge about the basics of drawing submitted their work. They didn't even follow the tutorials or the instructions given and because this the quality of their drawings was very low.  Based on what they uploaded, I left them an honest feedback and I tried not to mess their final score too much. Now some of these people (I do remember their names, that's how bad their work was) are not grading me correctly and I really don't understant why. I graduated from art school. With all due respect, I believe that the instructor of this course should be the one who grades some of the assignments.

It carries you from what specific problem you want to find solution to (it could be very simple), up to developing an artifact that can address the stated problem. It could be so demanding also since it requires you to interview people, come up with numerous drawings, make several prototypes, and you're obliged to make many peer reviews.
