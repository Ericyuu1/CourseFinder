106759622~COURSE!~Xp5FeLmNEeuzGxLrFW5SVw,1669871842526,4,0,Good course overall.  I think that a lot of this content could have been introduced earlier in the specialization. It's a pretty thorough treatment of basic linux commands.   It would have been a lot more useful to know how to compile with GCC on my own computer as an alternative to using the Codecast platform in the browser.  ,0,0,Richard Creek,106759622
