99146904~COURSE!~ysb67rpBEeqpnQo7rNpWQQ,1666848873903,2,0,"â€‹This course was far more confusing than the other courses in this specialization. Part of the confusion, for me, stems from the fact that there was rarely any generic syntax provided. The other SAS courses I've taken provided generic syntax and explained various statements and options so that when I take notes and apply these procedures to other problems and other data sets it is relatively easy to make the connections. In this course the only syntax was in the demos and was already applied to the problem used throughout the course, leaving me to have to figure out why certain (macro)variables or data sets or values were being used in a procedure. I will have to go through all of the content of this course a second time to retain a lot of the information. ",0,0,K,99146904

53812276~COURSE!~ysb67rpBEeqpnQo7rNpWQQ,1632898035177,5,0,Awesome course about the predictive modeling with logistic regression using SAS. The instructor is fantastic teaching us from the ground up step by step with excellent explanations. The coding was also built from beginning to the end with easy flow. Highly recommend taking this class for anyone who would like to advance their predictive modeling with logistic regression using SAS.,0,0,Suhaimi Chan,53812276
