107957410~COURSE!~2eMfhbXpEeuVARITHCE31Q,1654094442756,1,0,"I​ assume the author did their best but I noticed a few things that are off:-​ I understand that this course is not about HTML and CSS, but the layout is done with tables. I think that sets a bad example, teachers should strive to give an example by using best practices.-​ The <footer></footer> is placed after the closing body tag. That is just wrong.-​ The shorthand for opening php tags and echoing (<?= $someVar; ?>)is shown but never repeated. I wonder why you would learn something new but not reinforce it by using it.-​ The ; is often missing from statements.",0,0,Deleted Account,107957410
