6895961~COURSE!~ljHsJdIwEeycygpu1IloEQ,1670221833934,5,0,I really enjoyed this course. It had the prefect balance of theory and hands-on practice. I got obsessed with the LunarLander training in week three - so much fun and learning. The Bonsai platform itself worked very well despite being in Preview (Dec 2022). I highly recommend this course it if you're interested in Autonomous AI tools.,0,0,Egina Malaj,6895961
