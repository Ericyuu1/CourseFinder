I mean, teaching these things is so valuable, but no professor I have had since high school has ever taken the time to teach this simple concepts with examples as well, such as cutting the clutter, using more verbs, using the active voice instead of the passive voice, etc. Although I started this course to just learn how to write effectively, I didn't like the last units because they consisted on how to write papers, how to submit them, etc., and I wasn't searching for that. But for everything else, excellent course and excellent professor. The course is designed to constantly test your skills and make sure you learns all the writing principles.

article used in the assignment below is no doubt after the material was
released in the course. I write to address the issue and believe it may be
useful as a teaching point.    Writing in the Sciences, Week 8, Peer Graded Assignment:Below is an exact copy of the assignment.The following summary appeared in a paper in PLOS Biology.""Despite scientific and technological advances,
communication has remained impossible for persons suffering from complete motor
paralysis but intact cognitive and emotional processing, a condition that is
called completely locked-in state. Brain–computer interfaces based on
neuroelectrical technology (like an electroencephalogram) have failed at
providing patients in a completely locked-in state with means to communicate.
Therefore, here we explored if a brain–computer interface based on functional
near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)—which measures brain hemodynamic responses
associated with neuronal activity—could overcome this barrier. Four patients
suffering from advanced amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), two of them in
permanent completely locked-in state and two entering the completely locked-in
state without reliable means of communication, learned to answer personal
questions with known answers and open questions requiring a “yes” or “no” by
using frontocentral oxygenation changes measured with fNIRS. These results are,
potentially, the first step towards abolition of completely locked-in states,
at least for patients with ALS.""Research References:https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002593  Published Jan 31, 2017.https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000089

Foundation (GRF). Student Recommendation, William
Sparks (completed the course): If the paper continues as the Week
8, Peer Graded exercise, I believe the model answer should be adjusted to add
one sentence about the charges, subsequent investigation, and findings of the
GRF. It is unknown if the deficiencies would have made any difference to the
outcome of the research. I believe this paper remains a fantastic assignment
and in some respects is now better due to the conflict and the path that
thorough research of the exercise should no doubt discover by students in the
course.   I reviewed 8 exercises for this
module and zero mentioned the retraction or findings of the misconduct
investigation. Of note, I was fully aware of it but did not mention it either.
I said nothing to keep the question internal to Stanford and Coursera. Perhaps
others felt the same way. ",0,1,William Sparks,40859958

I have a PhD in chemistry from Ga Tech and work as a freelance editor with scientists who are non-native English speakers, and I took this course because I never received any formal editing training. This course has been great for improving my editing skills, allowing me to work more efficiently and quickly. Weeks 1-6 were filled with some of the most useful information I've ever read. I've already started incorporating the skills I've learned in this course into my editing work.As others have stated, I do wish that there was more non-medical content.  I also found the peer-review exercises to be quite useless (at least as far as the grading goes), as most people completing this course appear to be non-native English speakers. The content in Weeks 7 and 8 was not all that useful too me, and seemed to try to cover too much.A suggestion: when discussing the major sections of a paper, Kristin split the Results and Discussion section into two sections; however, some journals combine the Results and Discussion sections, and I think some commentary on this would also be very helpful!",0,30,Brandon Lynn Sharp,57884435

I appreciate also the lessons on the writing and publishing process, and the communication tasks scientists must deal with. My main critique regards the writing of personal statements and letters of recommendation: I believe that resorting to too many personal things in these kind of instances is an instrumentalization of our personal lives and activities.
