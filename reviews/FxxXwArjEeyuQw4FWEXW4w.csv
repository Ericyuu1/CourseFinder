92056843~COURSE!~FxxXwArjEeyuQw4FWEXW4w,1664318106515,1,0,This Specialization is rated as a beginner level. Not true. In the second module you will get into excersices that require VB programming skills. This class is at least intermediate and you will specifically need some prior VB skills before you take this course. UI please list VB as a pre-req so that people dont waste their time like me and get into the second module just to find out that they dont have all of the pre-reqs needed to be successful in this course.,0,0,Nate Koller,92056843
