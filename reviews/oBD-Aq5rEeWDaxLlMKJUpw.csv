They asked 5 peer revview to pass the course for each project, and they force you to read the optional material otherwise you can't pass the quiz. They only test the hardest part in the quiz to keep you as long as you can in each course so that they can earn money. Anyone see this PLEASE RUN AWAY FROM THIS WORST COURSE!!!!

Learnt a lot!Something which I did not like was CodeSkulptor, which is substandard for somebody used to running full-fledged editors like VSCode/Atom. Also, the editor was relatively tiny on the browser on my smallish laptop screen.I understand that a lot of people are new to computer science and python, and might find it hard to set up a local development environment on their machines, but forcing the rest of us to use CodeSkulptor was a turn-off.Even if I copy over the starter code, there would still be other classes used within it whose implementations I would not have.

You can clearly feel, that the previous two courses were like a kinder garden, and these two are already much more challenging and demanding in terms of complexity.

I personally took this course specifically for that reason as my degree was not in computer science and I didn't want to approach programming/coding without learning some level of computer science concepts. I'll also say as someone who has historically been intimidated by math (and by extension more math-intensive work like computer science) - as long as you're willing to take the time to really understand the homework preceding the weekly project, you'll be just fine even if you're not super confident with math just yet.",0,1,Evan Smith,25322664

If you have lots of programming experience, I expect the mini-project would take you less time, at least once you've conceptualized how to solve the problem/project. And it is this thinking - rather than programming - that is the main thing the instructors want students to take away from this course. In other words, this is not an intermediate Python course. But it is a great class. You'll get an introduction to searches, data structures, recursion, trees, and how to test your software. And like IIPP, the mini-projects are based a fun games.
