43132881~COURSE!~a4L1-fK_Eeil7RIbJCG24A,1593526056436,5,0,"It is an absolute pleasure to take this course with Professor Deng who has a neat sense of humour as he is presenting the lectures. The course material isn't very difficult in theory however the learner must possess mastery over C and C++ in order to get the most out of this course. The upside is definitely the lectures, the downside in my opinion are the coding assignments the instructions are very vague and hard to understand. Other than that, a very enjoyable course to help me better understand Data Structures and Algorithms!",0,1,Toni He,43132881
