587026~COURSE!~tE4j0qhMEeecqgpT6QjMdA,1534939954735,5,0," I like very much the architecture-based approach of these courses/ specialization.At the end, the goal of an Enterprise, in a general sense, is to satisfy the local or global community necessity in an effective and efficient way. Surreally with the choose of the correct technology, frameworks, languages, instructions, details.... but , at the end, what is really important is the value offered.That said, I think, that this specialization, provides the mindset, the knowledge, the skills and tools applicable in a corporate environment. Technology is important, yes, but, from my point of view, it is most important to consider the value that is emerging from the holistic approach of all the topics in the different modules of the courses, including also the final capstone project.

Thank you very much
Romeo and all instructors for this continuous learning professional

I have two modest improvement proposals. The oil price prediction assignment could be converted in an anomaly analysis - possibly in a Pytorch setting to deepen the initial presentation of Pytorch -, perhaps a more meaningful use of deep-learning to this time series data. Week 4 is a touch light compared to weeks 2 and 3 and could be improved by an assigment illustrating feedback between the anomaly signals in the IOT framework of week 3 and the IOT setup itself. Both anomaly and feedback would be deep-learning based.   ",0,0,FRANCOIS KRATZ,11585697
