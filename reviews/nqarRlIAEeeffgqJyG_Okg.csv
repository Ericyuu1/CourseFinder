75717229~COURSE!~nqarRlIAEeeffgqJyG_Okg,1617360913733,5,0,"As the name suggests, the course is really design-oriented and helps apply some very convenient network analysis techniques to complex cases. I am grateful for the wonderful experience and the new tools I have picked up in the learning process. Particularly, the technique of damping the resonances in the plant itself. Nipping it in the bud, now makes a lot more sense, rather than mulling over a complex controller design. Thank you.",0,0,Rahul Dewani,75717229
