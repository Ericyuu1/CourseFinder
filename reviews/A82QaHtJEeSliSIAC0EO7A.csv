27665736~COURSE!~A82QaHtJEeSliSIAC0EO7A,1504616620350,1,0,"The class was very high level and tailored for clinical staff interested in an overview of Healthcare Informatics.  I was able to complete in 3 days and was surprised that a fee was charged upfront for a short and high level class.  This class was marketed as 9 weeks long. Not being a clinical staff, this class was only minimally helpful.  The quizzes at the end were painful as they expected 100% correct answers where particular words from the instructor had to be remembered.  Compared to the other Coursera classes this was not good enough quality with a compulsory fee.",0,7,Deepa Fernandes Prabhu,27665736

The extra reading materials and sometimes the external referenced evidences are more often than not declared  unreachable. That may be due to lost of internet connectivity; improvement is urgently desired in this regard. This is important as learners, many a time, want to confirm and work by the urge to know which, most of the time, is instantaneous. Once such tempo is lost, the need to revert may no longer be available.Yet all in all, my resolution is that this course is a must for every data-driven and health-curious learner especially in this current and dynamic world of technological advancement!",0,0,BOLAJI Musibau Anifowose,58403152
