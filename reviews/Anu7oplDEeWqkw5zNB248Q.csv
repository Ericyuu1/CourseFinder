28788554~COURSE!~Anu7oplDEeWqkw5zNB248Q,1514964475065,1,0,"The worst executed course I have taken in 36 years of post-graduate education.1  The instructor speaks so fast it is difficult even for a native English speaker like myself to understand.2.  This course is only suitable as a review for people who are experts in the field already.  Even if you know how to use Bioconductor and are familiar with programming in R, if you don't know the tools being used already the instruction in the course will not give enough information to be able to do the quizzes without a great deal of difficulty. 3.  The examples presented are thrown out in a cursory fashion without enough detail about how the data is being set up or manipulated.  Matrices are transformed and recombined with little explanation about why things are being done. 4.  Although generalizing from material presented to new applications is a valid instructional approach, the instruction does not give the student enough information to do this and the instructor expects students to be able to figure out new algorithms from vague public domain documentation. 5.  Although the instructor makes an impassioned plea for carefully thought out statistical test design, proper documentation of work flow, and appropriate use of p-values, he does not describe the interpretation of statistical tools presented.  For example, tools for calculating thousands of principle components in seconds is given, but beyond showing clusters of dots on a graph may indicate a genetic cluster does not explain what the individual points in the PCA mean.In summary, the tools presented are very powerful but are not well described.  Extensive revision to the course is needed.",0,23,Paul Saunders,28788554

There's way too much material covered so shallowly that the instructor may as well not have bothered.   While it is true that the course is heavily annotated with web links and references, IMNSHO, this is a cop-out.   This course could improve dramatically by extending it a couple of weeks and covering some of the material in greater depth.

The course itself is not suitable for beginners, since it requires proficient R skills and some knowledge in statistics. The ways of illustration on many definitions are unprofessional and shallow, so it sounds confusing at least for me, who majored in public health and has some experience in this field.

I liked how the professor recommended some extra reading at the end of every topic. I also really liked the fact that he recommended some extra courses to be taken. But despite that, the course itself was a bit too short - the topics introduced just scratched the surface. This made sitting through the R tutorials particularly tedious - how would one get the use of R tools to do the tasks, if they haven't understood the theory properly? I know it's supposed to be an intro course, but still in its current state it can be a bit confusing. I would suggest making it somewhat longer, so that the intro to each topic could be done a bit more in depth - maybe focusing a bit more on the theory, so that the students could get an intuition for the methods, rather than just doing R commands which for them mean nothing if the theory is still very blurry.",0,1,Mihaela Mihaylova,7460878

45877786~COURSE!~Anu7oplDEeWqkw5zNB248Q,1609623423131,4,0,"I thought this course covered a good set of relatively well-organized material.I think some of the quiz questions (and optional analysis) was a little buggy in Week 1 (where I needed to use different versions of R for different questions), and I am not sure if that is because some time has passed since the course was first created.  There were also issues for some of the questions in the other weeks, but I don’t remember being as frustrated when figuring out how to get an answer that was counted as correct (or, more specifically, not being able to run the intended code).Additionally, I think this course will probably take more time to complete than listed in the syllabus.  I support needing to take more time to learn the material, but I think the estimates can be kind of important when deciding if there is enough time to take the course (for somebody who already has a full time job).There was also at least one section in Week1 that I thought was more of an opinion.  For example, there are important and popular programs for genomic analysis that are *not* available through Bioconductor (including some mentioned in Week 4), and I don’t think they are less “trustworthy.”  However, I agree that listing resources and explaining the differences is important.I think I mentioned it in another course review, but I think the limitations to the methods are something to consider.  So, I agree that p-hacking can be a problem, but I think telling people that they should only analyze their data once can also cause problems.  I also agree with sharing a public log, even if the problems/bugs that are fixed are not emphasized as much in an official report/problem (as findings that should be given weight in the conclusions, if you found reason why they were wrong).I noticed that there was a moderator responding to forum questions, so that was nice.I imagine that I might participate a bit more, even though I have formally completed the course.Thank you!",0,0,Charles Warden,45877786
