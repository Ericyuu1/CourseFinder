1519196~COURSE!~a3Q1g0YtEeeJdBL3H0RODg,1554470501900,1,0,This course is not worth the time and money. I would suggest doing  any of courses in the Andrew Ng's deeplearning.ai specialization instead. No programming assignments that's evaluated here. No instructor or TA are active in the forums. No questions are answered in the discussion forums.  Many courses in deep learning are available online where you can actually learn something by getting hands-on. ,0,4,Ramakrishna Bijanapalli Chakri,1519196

65465431~COURSE!~a3Q1g0YtEeeJdBL3H0RODg,1601062492348,3,0,"Not the best course I must say! The course is theoretical & no assessment of practical exercises here. The exercises here are confusing. Even the quizzes do not what significant digits should be used to have the answers correct. Like at one question it's 0.xx & the next question it's 0.xxx . And the most frustrating thing, the instructors are completely absent from the discussion forums & even doesn't come to see what's happening overall & how're the students reacting for it.This is the first course I've rated 4 or less stars because I chose it from other courses due to the Brand ""Intel"" who can teach me the concept in the right way. But this is not the course from Legendary ""Intel"" as it seemed. By the way, I would like to thank the Instructors for their time in the courses & would hope to modify it the way that makes it ""Interactive"". Good luck!!",0,0,Khandaker Mashrur Ahmed,65465431

49273551~COURSE!~a3Q1g0YtEeeJdBL3H0RODg,1593020176879,3,0,"While the material was fine, there were some issues with this course.  Many of the exercises would not work because they were outdated or had files missing. Critical information, such as formulas for solving problems, was not presented in a way that let you know it was important. Because of this, I found myself backtracking and scouring through videos to find what I was missing.  This course does not feel like an ""introduction"" class; it seems like there should be a pre-requisite to it, or at least a list of what-you-will-need before taking it.",0,0,Cynthia Kaye,49273551
