99944723~COURSE!~IIoidx0zEeaeiw6Wrvtw9w,1644363928597,1,0,"I was very disappointed by this course. This course has very little learning materials since the professor just gives a brief overview of certain topics alongside a couple of examples and even explicitly states that google/stack overflow are likely to be required for students to be able to complete the exercises. I admit that learning how to look up how to do certain things is important to learning programming, however I don't think this course strikes the right balance here at all, which can be extremely frustrating considering how much you pay to enroll.The week 1 learning materials are the most detailed but also essentially useless - there is not a single line of Python code at all. Instead, you have to make your way through the ""principles"" of data visualisation - most of which are painfully obvious (for example - the visualisation should not mislead the reader). Perhaps for some people with certain backgrounds this may be useful but I personally think section could be significantly shorter or even skipped entirely, even for an introductory course. From speaking to friends who are much more skilled in Python than I am, it seems that matplotlib is fairly outdated and other reviews mention that this course is quite old and the content has not been updated. I got the sense that this professor is quite stuck in his ways and I often found myself thinking ""surely there's an easier way to do this"". I was pleasantly surprised to find an excellent younger teacher briefly cover plotting in Pandas and Seaborn, which produced significantly better plots with significantly fewer lines of code, however you have to use matplotlib for all the assignments.The assignments, especially 2 and 3, are one of the best things about the course and provide interesting challenges. However, it felt like you pretty much have to teach yourself how to do them from scratch. I found that the discussion forums had some useful hints to help get started since assigment 2 is a little bit unclear. The peer review system is OK - the mark schemes are very easy to follow but also not well thought out. On the other hand, I received great feedback within a day or so for each assignment. Overall, I think it's clear that the course could do with some improvements. Unfortunately, it feels like the primary aim of this course is to make as much money with as little effort as possible, so I'm not sure how likely this is. ",0,3,Nikolai Tolokonnikov,99944723

44988035~COURSE!~IIoidx0zEeaeiw6Wrvtw9w,1573376721049,1,0,"CONTENT: The instructor shows some examples of different plots in python (e.g. line, bar, scatter) and some concepts (e.g. histograms or heat maps) but doesn't properly explain anything. Mostly you'll get an example graph with snippets of code only working for that particular example and for the assignment you're ""strongly encouraged to use other sources"". That's not what you're supposed to get when you're paying for an online course. You should get proper explanations.ASSIGNMENTS: You're basically told to get data from any source you like and then plot some graphs. If you've had some experience with python and got your explanations for plotting from somewhere else, you'll mostly spend more time looking for data to present than for the actual assignment.I don't understand why there's no selection of graphs and data sets to choose from so you can concentrate on programming and properly presenting data rather than wasting your time looking at reddit like recommended by the instructor.ASSIGNMENT GRADING: You’ll have to grade your peers’ assignments with a rubric that’s just not working: you can give points for someone uploading an image/writing a paragraph of text, but you have to either give 0 or 100%, so there’s not way to properly grade partially wrong answers. Example: yes, there is an uploaded image and the student has explained how it follows “Cairo’s principle of beauty”, but it doesn’t follow the principle of beauty. So, how to grade: zero or hundred percent?Likewise, your assignments are graded by your peers, so you’ll usually have at least one or two days to add to each assignment. You should take this into account when opting for the monthly subscription. Additionally, neither you nor your peers are qualified to grade the assignments, because you’re just learning how to curate and present data (if you’re not already a scientist and just want to learn how to do this in Python).DISCUSSION FORUMS: You won’t find answers or discussions in the discussion forum. There are only posts asking to please grade a student’s assignment because it is urgent because the subscription is ending soon (see above).SUMMARY: If you need the certificate for Applied Data Science in Python, you probably must take this course.

It was very disappointing how little effort the course staff put into this course. The whole first week the professor was rambling about some design authorities spitting out names like Tufte and Cairo and asserting how important it was to mind the design features. One might argue about the importance of this, but there was not a single item of actual practical application over all the first week. Then in the second week finally came some material on matplotlib, also horrendously presented. Professor Brooks showed it the way that made one of the best plotting tools in the world look revolting. Speaking factually, the information was scarce and consisted largely of using matplotlib in the convoluted way with the practices nobody actually uses. And again, most of the actual learning was left to the user in the form of Professor Brooks encouraging the learner to read documentation and ask questions on stackexchange. I can do this and I do this a lot in my work but having paid money for this course, I did not do it for a dismissal like this.

It is for this reason that I choose to take and pay for a course instead of muddling around the documentation alone and pulling my hair out. This course does not remedy that issue. I find the professor likeable and he cares about his subject but I have to say it directly and bluntly: the videos are examples of teaching issues with incomplete treatment of basics before moving onto complexities. There is more than a little word salad to get through in the videos which are more and more frustrating as you re-watch them expecting you might have missed important info needed to complete the assignments.

 # Considered the lack of best practice and more advanced examples forces you to learn by yourself (aka Coursera discussion forums, google, stack overflow etc.) This is great but I don’t think this was the intention when creating this course.

Lectures are either too shallow or too deep. Too shallow as in there are only several short videos on Matplotlib that are very introductory and doesn't show much. Too deep as in Professor Brooks went dove deep into the architecture of Matplotlib, which I think could have been simplified and delivered in a better way.The assignment for Week 2 and 3 are ok - but I'm starting to hate how vague the instructions are and everyone turns to the forums to figure it out. Assignment Week 4 is a disappointment, as the allocated topic is almost impossible to draw up information on and in the end everyone just pick their own 2 dataasets, which is another challenge. I feel a better way would be offer several sets of data to choose from.this course is not entirely bad, I just feel that i didn't learn as much and what I learn comes from googling Stack Overflow or other websites while doingthe assignments.

Students grade each others' work product, and it is clear from doing so there are many interpretations of the exercises.And, some students doing the evaluation of others are clearly not qualified to do so - if one does not really understand basic Python or statistics, they should not be indicating the calculations are wrong...  And with three reviews required - it seems the grader uses the lowest grade of the three.  If 2 reviewers give full marks, and another gives a 0, the 0 is what is recorded.

There is a lot of software terminology involved in the beginning when explaining matplotlib notebook and it was hard to follow that part. My biggest complaint is the Coursera's online Jupyter notebook. I got very frustrated with it.

It's a bit disappointing because I finally was doing the assignments with external sources of information. It was not much usage in videos.2) You have to spend tonnes of time on your own digging into possible solutions to learn how to do the assignments. But if you care only about passing it - don't worry it will take you maximum 1 hour as there are a lot of already done examples on many sites.3) While grading the assignments you can see a lot of copies. Once I've found my own project copied. After that I decided to leave the code with advanced charts only for my personal usage and for assignments - the simple basic charts.To sum up - great source if you like exploring new things and digging into details on your own. It's like a tool that give you some direction and base to start. If you prefer to get information ready to use - it's not for you.

22785324~COURSE!~IIoidx0zEeaeiw6Wrvtw9w,1610221371577,4,0,"This was a very good course and I feel like I really learned a lot. It starts out with a module on how data visualizations can mislead (intentionally or unintentionally!) and principles of good data visualization. I found it very informative. The instructor used good examples and also walks through the tweaking of a plot to follow the principles of good data visualization using matplotlib.Subsequent modules give you lots of experience with the matplotlib library and the process of transforming data and making visualizations. There is often a moderate amount of flexibility in the assignments, giving the learner the opportunity to take as much as they want from the experience. You get back what you put in. Multiple assignments have you go out in the real world to look for charts and data to use in your assignments, which give you a very good opportunity to apply what you've learned, moreso than in constrained assignments where data is given to you.My only complaint is the peer grading system, but I wish I could only dock half a star for it. I think it was actually implemented very well for a peer-grading system in a MOOC, and I even think that peer grading was the appropriate choice of grading system for this course, but of course it is going to have its downfalls. You are graded on a rubric provided by the instructor which mostly awards points just for completion of various parts of the assignment. This is how it has to be, as judging the quality of a visualization is very subjective (and dependent on the grader's comprehension of the course content), and students' grades shouldn't suffer because one of their graders doesn't like the colour red or because they don't understand the principles we are supposed to be applying. As an aside, there are many complaints that students are directed to read the documentation of a given library, google, search stackoverflow, etc. A course cannot teach you everything you need to know about a library. You are going to have to look things up yourself, especially when debugging. This is the reality coding.",0,0,Sunny,22785324

Week 2 has a bit too much esoterica for an intro course, and I'd rather have week 3 and 4 concepts reinforced more instead.

liked the peer-reviewed assignments. There are a lot of fellow learners, thus
you never have to wait more than a couple of hours (or maybe a day) to receive
feedback and a grade. The assignments meet different skill levels and let you
decide how much effort you want to put in. You could do them in 20-60 minutes

The problem is that a person can't grasp them without experience...For example, several videos discuss idea of Edward Tufte. I understand that CS and mathematical statistics are the background of the instructor, but really, Tufte had only repeated well-known basics. Indeed, it was Leonardo da Vinci who first said that ""simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"". He was followed by Antoine de Saint Exupéry with ""It seems that perfection is attained not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing more to remove"" and the KISS principle of Kelly Johnson of Lockheed Martin Skunk Works.Perhaps, for the authors of the course software engineering is closer: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_Linux#Principles ...",0,0,Leonid Isaev,34665290
