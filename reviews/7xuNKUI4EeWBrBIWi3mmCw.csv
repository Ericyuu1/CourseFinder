I did not like the course forcing us to open a website and writing blog posts about and for the course, they could have easily been written in Coursera's system and I do not enjoy providing SEO forcefully.

My teaching is still traditional way and I found students getting lost interests. Thanks to this course encourage me to think about teaching renovation through the assignments.
