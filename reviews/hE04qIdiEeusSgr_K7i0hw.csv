10476328~COURSE!~hE04qIdiEeusSgr_K7i0hw,1632210070885,2,0,It is a very poore and boring course. It has some main points and thoughts about after covid time and real practice descriptions which uses nowadays but actually the lecturers just read the text and you can't feel involvement or interaction with them in this course. Tests are just tests and the writing questions just request you to write something and no matter what even if you will just a copy past from the text under the video... Looks like no one monitor that course and it was done just for a record. I finished that for 2 evenings and didn't know something new...very disappointed.,0,3,Maria Rudenok,10476328
