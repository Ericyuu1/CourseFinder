My aim is to get to an end within one month and this is possible. But so I´m sitting here and wait for other students which can evaluate my work. Also I can´t find any help in the help-center regarding this problem,  no helpdesk, no mail-adress, no chat. S​orry, but this is bad design and miles away from a professional plattform.
