39938244~COURSE!~n0dTuvR2EeiG5hJIW1RLmg,1656243218996,1,0,Q​uiz questions are worded very confusingly. There is hardly anything about big data.,0,0,Eli Rugaard,39938244
19296320~COURSE!~n0dTuvR2EeiG5hJIW1RLmg,1608664372598,2,0,"The course promises information about big data and language . It is, however, a review course of some grammar terms with a small addition about big data. I cannot find the purpose of extensive descriptions of register or parts of speech including some tips on how to write a formal text in a course on this topic. The last part (Parts of Speech) provides a little bit messy typology where different approaches of what a part of speech is, are mixed.",0,2,Jan Oko,19296320
1711278~COURSE!~n0dTuvR2EeiG5hJIW1RLmg,1590849461156,2,0,"I expected more discussions on big data, methodologies and tools to analyze big data rather than lectures on grammar. Perhaps what I expect are in ""Big data and Language 2."" This is probably good for students who know very little about basic principles of linguistics and want to get a grammar refresher.",0,3,Elsie Marie Or,1711278
47634614~COURSE!~n0dTuvR2EeiG5hJIW1RLmg,1612826560969,3,0,"Disappointed with the course. This first part is mainly about the English language and linguistics. I was expecting at least some explanation into how we would use this information to do research with big data. I understand that this knowledge may be required to analyze data, but the course doesn't make it clear, nor state that this is the sole purpose of the first part. Nevertheless, the explanations might be useful for someone learning this characteristics of language from zero. ",0,3,Otavio Neto,47634614

However, the trainer/teacher struggled to communicate in some areas, most likely owing to language barriers (i.e., English).
