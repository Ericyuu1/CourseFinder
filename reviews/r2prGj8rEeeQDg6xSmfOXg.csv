It relies on at least four people being enrolled in the same stage of the course at the same time for peer review, but looking back at the history of the discussion forum that has almost never seemed to have been the case.  It definitely wasn't in mine, and at time of writing I've been unable to complete the course for this reason.",0,2,Johann Botha,35968418

I truly loved how every module was set up; the speakers were incredible and I would actually be thrilled to study with Mary and Bill at some point in the future - their work truly touched me and I'm hoping to read more of their material on my own time. The concepts that were introduced were truly enriching and the questions asked helped me grow in so many different ways, just looking back to how I approached the first week and that assignment compared to the final week for example. The course pushed me to delve deeper into the materials and I branched out in my readings as a natural consequence, which I am very grateful for, because I've only realized how much more there is to this field and how little I still know. I am so excited to continue my journey in education and I'm forever grateful to all of the professors who contributed to my growth in any way in this course. Thank you, truly! <3",0,2,Lydia Renold,2187356
