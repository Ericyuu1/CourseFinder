If you have to take this course for the MS-DS course then power through, if you don’t find another course to take. All educational content in this course came via links to outside educational materials/sources: TED Talks on YouTube and links to articles. Those sources were beneficial, but I didn't need to take this course to get that info. It was pretty frustrating especially given that I think this is a very interesting topic and extremely important right now.    ",0,1,matt terry,11888153
