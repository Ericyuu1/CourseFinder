The course is poorly designed (for example, the lecturer doesn't begin by explaining what Islam is, what distinguish shiites and sunnis...). The lecturer makes almost no use of the media (apart from him reading his notes we only see a picture and a title from time to time), he is unbearably slow, stumbles on words (why didn't they re-shoot some of these sequences???). His course is an almost uninterrupted flow of words, with very little effort to hierarchize the claims he makes (slides would have helped doing just that), and, what is worst, he repeats himself time and again. His ideas are half-backed, as if he lacked the time to think things through. I have attended two weeks of the course and am amazed by how little I have learned. Don't loose your time watching this.

interest. This course has been a wonderful opportunity to learn how Muslim countries
have struggled with the idea of democracy and constitutionalism in the creation
of their countries. Dr Ebrahim Afsah’s excellent course has been a
definite building block of my understanding of the region of the world in which
I struggle to comprehend political policy. The historical context of constitutional
issues which this course covered will go a long way in how I will understand
ideologic issues that I come across. Understanding historical context is always
an issue when looking at how countries develop their foreign policies, and if
you have a foundational understanding in how that country developed its own
government, it definitely helps you understand how they not only look at
themselves, but also how they deal with other counties, whether they follow
traditional government building or not. This course was definitely one I would and
have admonish others who desire a deeper understanding of the issues these governments
have and I am looking forward to finding and completing other courses in this vein.
