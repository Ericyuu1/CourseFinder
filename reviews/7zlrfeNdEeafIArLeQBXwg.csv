In having tried to take the Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python class (also offered by Rice University) in addition to this one, I've noticed that the instructors seem to have a bad habit of walking you through with baby steps all the way up until the end - where they throw a bunch of new concepts/information at you or combine a bunch of concepts in a way that has not been explained, and expect you to fare well. As someone with no experience in programming, I felt it was misleading to have 3.5 weeks of nicely explained introductory level material, only to be thrown more advanced material with little explanation the last 0.5 weeks of study.

The two instructors were articulate and showed that they wanted to impart their knowledge. Points go for developing the final assignment for a previous session, being rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock. As well I'd like to share some (mostly minor) negatives. First of all, I needed to invest about double their advertised weekly time commitment of 5 to 7 hours. I would have found it helpful to get feedback on submissions, and would have preferred a peer-marking system. Finally, I think the software for marking the final project is problematic.

I think the videos do a good job of explaining the content being presented.  The major problem is when it gets to the exercises at the end of each week and before the quiz.  I found myself totally lost on these.  I watched the videos just about every day and stayed engaged as much as possible.  Once the exercises came up, it was as if I had not learned a thing and I did not even know where to begin on some of them.  The fundamental flaw in this class is lack of practical application between each lecture with exercises to stimulate learning of the subject matter.  Going through a video and explaining apparently did nothing for me.  There absolutely needs to be more exercises interspersed between the lectures.   I fear that the next weeks are going to really throw me off, and I do not have time to go back and review all the past weeks.  My other suggestion is that we are all not mathematicians taking this.
