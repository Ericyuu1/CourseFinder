I very much respect Dr. Robert DeSalle & the other authors/presenters. This is such an important issue & one that there is much ignorance & misinformation surrounding.

This is the first Coursera class that I've run into this (this is my 7th), in the past I've found them to be very interesting.",0,0,J. B. Walters,2205076
