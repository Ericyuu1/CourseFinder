93279542~COURSE!~CZQSsVISEeuoIw4T1lBSSQ,1670524956090,2,0,The courses in this specialization involved far too much reading and far too little practical application. Having to read tedious articles on Trailhead would often take over an hour to complete with little to no activities to go with them.Everything covered in these four courses could've been done in two hours of videos and  15-20 meaningful hands-on activities. ,0,0,Danny Crescenti,93279542
