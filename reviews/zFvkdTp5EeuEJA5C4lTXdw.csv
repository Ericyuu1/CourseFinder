The material is scattered, confusing, and delivered in a very hard-to-follow format. The assignments are even worse! I am SO disappointed in my first Coursera course :( ",0,0,Summer Kenney,120871007

Assignments had little if anything at all to do with the content of the lectures and much of what was covered in the lectures overlaps with other mandatory courses in the MSDS program. Huge waste of time and money.",0,0,George Baker,109223230

I asked about a programming assignment that looks defective in the ""urgent help"" discussion forum a month ago, and still haven't seen a response.   So, I'm not entirely sure whether the course is defective or not, but it's pretty silly to put up an ""urgent help"" forum and then ignore it.T​his course has required programming assignments that only give a score as feedback, and that seem to be unclear, incomplete, incorrect or misleading.T​he coverage of material in the course also seems excessively basic and superficial.T​he coverage of material in the course also seems rather superficial.",0,0,Nathan Hellweg,99262941
