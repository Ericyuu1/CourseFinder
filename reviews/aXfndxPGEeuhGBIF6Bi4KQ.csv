1427998~COURSE!~aXfndxPGEeuhGBIF6Bi4KQ,1676082868581,3,0,"There is neither much of learning nor learning flow. I almost gave up on this specialization. Maybe my expectations were too high. I've done many courses online and this one definitely won't be my favorite, or maybe Healthcare isn't my topic of interest at all so I see this course from a wrong perspective.I'm a Tensorflow guy not Pytorch and homework is mostly brute-forcing the tasks to fit the goal eventually forgetting what you are doing. Maybe I'm dumb on such things? Maybe my review would be better if I knew how to work with Pytorch before taking this specialization. People say that Pytorch is much easier than Tensorflow but here I see it more frustrating and counterintuitive. ",0,0,Ernest Warzocha,1427998
