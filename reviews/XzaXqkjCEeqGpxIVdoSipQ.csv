8379252~COURSE!~XzaXqkjCEeqGpxIVdoSipQ,1617551400329,2,0,"The course starts with really valuable insights into main trends of modern IO management, but goes on with questionable points on the HR mainstreams. The interviews might be helpful, although the question is not always answered. 50% of video lectures are written/narrated in absolutely non-understandable language (for non-native speakers), the speed is not adjusted to the listener, it is therefore much more helpful to read the transcript. The true value of the quizzes doesn¬¥t require any critical thinking - the tasks are mostly oriented towards ""choose three trends"" or ""choose the relevant..."" etc. Final quiz can be easily done without any preparatory work or going through the materials of the week. The absence of the literature on the topics discussed is another minus. The quizzes themselves haven¬¥t been checked for spelling etc., there was even one case when the question was asked twice within one quiz (week 3 or 4, can not quite remember).

101100425~COURSE!~XzaXqkjCEeqGpxIVdoSipQ,1644912199208,4,0,"V‚Äãery interesting course, very well structured. I really enjoyed the chapter on financing development. Most professional participants are very clear and relevant, but some of them bring a minor contribution to the class. In general, there is a good dynamic and the class is never boring. A major point of improvement would be the assessment (per chapter and final), that is very basic and doesn't reflect a good understanding of the class. I‚Äã recommend following this course, that allows to get an overview and of the main challenges and trends of management of international development.",0,0,Gwenola Braud,101100425
67622984~COURSE!~XzaXqkjCEeqGpxIVdoSipQ,1643535604707,4,0,"This course is very useful for people with beginner to intermediate level of knowledge on International Development and International Organizations (IOs). It provides a comprehensive discussion on a variety of subjects in international development management, from who the actors are, funding mechanisms, to human resource management along with challenges and innovative ways for IOs in fulfilling their mandates moving forward.For improvement, I think it would be good to include more real-life and concrete examples of some of the concepts that were discussed, as well as simplifying some of the explanations so it can be better understood, especially since this topic covers a lot of technical areas and jargons. Overall it was a very insightful lesson and helped me understand more about the management side of international development, thank you Bocconi University and Coursera!",0,0,Andre,67622984
