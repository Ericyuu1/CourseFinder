107382203~COURSE!~blCylNgiEeiVYAo9v2qgfg,1656577145986,4,0,"I'm happy that I took this course. It has opened my eye to a whole new approach of research - the Research for Impact approach. This is where the research is done with key stakeholders as a way of easily communicating finsdings and creating the space for those stakeholders to utilize the research findings. Additionally, the materials in the course are presented by people who have vast experiences in research drawn from different fields. I like it!",0,0,Jacob J Flomo,107382203
55039309~COURSE!~blCylNgiEeiVYAo9v2qgfg,1642335671036,4,0,"It was a nice course that taught me the core principles of research for impact. To me, it is a pretty light course, easy to follow and to understand the knowledge conveyed. However, sometimes in the guest lecture videos I found the description of the impact research they conducted a bit too vague, which is a pity to me, because the research projects sounded really interesting. The assignments get you to think based on a personally chosen impact research project. That was really nice.",0,0,,55039309

But, there's general feedback that there should be a more structured way for the peer-graded assessments.

Having an University and an NGO (practitioner) design and run the course has resulted in the information being packaged in a manner that makes it possible to immediately use the principles taught in the field, while understanding the concepts and the context behind them. The latter has helped me understand the basis of effective research and makes it possible for me to apply what I have learnt to different situations while still keeping the core idea - research with people that results in  real life change  - in focus.",0,0,Indu Krishnaswamy,35614023

109624362~COURSE!~blCylNgiEeiVYAo9v2qgfg,1661265399319,5,0,"Research plays a pivotal role in various fields and settings. In the noble field of development and humanitarian work, we conduct and use research studies to conceptualize, plan, and implement appropriate programs and projects for and with the target priority sector(s). Research also aids us in advocating, lobbying, and influencing change in policies, practices, and behaviors that affect the underprivileged and marginalized. As a development work practitioner, I certainly find so much value in accomplishing this course and learning new concepts, tools, and processes that can potentially make my future professional and academic research undertakings more impactful. Through the Research for Impact approach, I was able to learn about the importance of Theory of Change (ToC), stakeholder mapping, Net-Map, power analysis, among others. The course also underscored that in dealing with complex problems and/or systems, the processes are nonlinear and iterative. Thus, the idea of “dancing” with the system is crucial as it enables researchers, practitioners, and other stakeholders to embrace its dynamic nature, adapt to its complexity, and influence the way it functions. What I also appreciate about this course is how the five elements of the Research for Impact approach were presented in a compartmentalized manner each week while keeping in my mind that these elements are all interdependent and interrelated. I love how the course syllabus was crafted in a way that the flow of discussion of various concepts as well as of the case studies turned out to be cohesive and learner-friendly. In addition, the practice and graded quizzes and peer-reviewed assignments were helpful in reinforcing in-depth learning and appreciation of Research for Impact. Finally, I am grateful to Coursera and its partner institutions, the University of Cape Town and Oxfam, for allowing me to take full advantage of this course through financial aid. Thank you so much!    ",0,0,Jose Ariel P. Culala,109624362
