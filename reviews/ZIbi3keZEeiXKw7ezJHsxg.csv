My main issue was with the peer review process. After submitting assignments you are at the mercy of others reviewing them correctly (or even at all). Equally, in reviewing others work I struggled with rubrics like 'is there an explanation'. In some cases the student had included an explanation that I thought was wrong. By the rubric this scores a tick but there is no check on the quality of the explanation. I didn't want to mark examples like that as nil in case it is me that is wrong, not the submitter.
