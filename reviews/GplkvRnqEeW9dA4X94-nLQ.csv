4469013~COURSE!~GplkvRnqEeW9dA4X94-nLQ,1480279079549,3,0,The course structure was well formatted. The order of the lessons and content presented made for learning intuitive. The follow along practice queries and end of lesson practice problems were also helpful interactives for the student. However there were mistakes in the answer keys or practice problem prompts that became more frequent in the lessons towards the end of the course. This made it difficult to practice the more complicated material and queries. It was also a big time waster when as a student you were unsure whether you were answering the correct question and if so whether your answer was correct. It would also been helpful to have more open ended practice problems at the end of the course in addition to the set provided. Finally I think this course would be better split into two parts. The first part should be geared towards querying data and focusing more on just pulling data and intermediate queries. The main audience would be analyst/data professionals that have privileges to pull data but not modify data. The second part of the course would be more useful to DBAs or professionals that have database admin privileges to insert/delete/modify data. I would also focus more heavily on database schemas in this second course relative to the first. ,0,0,Jerry Fan,4469013

However, when you write queries, sometimes, you do think your logic is right and query is right, why can't I get the same answer with the choices?And when I finish the quiz and look back to the answer, I even can't find the logic difference between answers and mine but the reality is I can't get the correct result. There is only one diff I have found in one specific question, that is, I didn't use the same format to define one constraint. But I do think my way is also fine and I also get an answer I think is totally correct from the logic.So I do suggest the answers should not be single sometimes, you should consider some specific formats or situation when students write their own queries.

By using real life data, it also accurately presented raw data as not perfectly organized or ""clean"". Filtering with subqueries, IN, WHERE, and OUTER JOIN statements are absolutely crucial in cleaning data in real life situations; this course did an excellent job of demonstrating that importance.I have 2 interrelated critiques however: The usage of 2 different platforms (MySQL for the exercises and Teradata for the quizzes) was very confusing given their distinct syntaxes. I think it would have been more powerful to have the exercises and quizzes on the same platform. Furthermore, the Teradata platform was oftentimes overwhelmed by the number of users and frequently crashed.

Before finishing this course, I was able to run queries to solve some real problems I was facing when working with my teammates. Essentially it's a great course. The only suggestions I could make is 1. Improve the Jupyter server stability. Sometimes it took me nearly an hour to get into it. 2.

Thank you very much Jana for helping us to get knowledge, hands on real life exercises and experience and some genuine tips and guidelines meted out to us through this course to make us confident and efficient data analyst! The only suggestion is the week 5 Teradata exercise which is tough and complicated but definitely worth it. However the answer key should be made available otherwise it is very  difficult to know whether one is right or not. Of course this fosters independence but it will be found difficult by average and sometimes even by above average students. Would request Jana to please take note of that.Thanks to Coursera for this wonderful course and to Jana and Daniel Egger, Tara for her quick response during support issues, to Duke University for promoting this course and to Dillards and Dognition team for sharing real-life data for our study and practice purpose. Grateful to all of you! Thank you very much! God bless all of you! I highly recommend this course to all SQL beginners and even intermediate developers!

Jana breaks the material down into digestible bits, gives you sufficient practice, and even if you don't get it, you can look at the answers to the practice questions and figure out where your thinking was incorrect.The 5th week wasn't as well broken down, especially the last set of Teradata exercises. New concepts or ways of structuring queries were being introduced in those exercises, but there was no way to check for a correct solution if I couldn't come with one on my own (which was unfortunately half of the time). I still got a good grade on my last quiz, but I can't say that I really truly learned how to write the more complicated queries. I would suggest that the last Teradata exercise set has more explanation or perhaps just answers that the student can refer to in order to understand why his/her line of thinking isn't working.Otherwise, a truly fantastic course.
