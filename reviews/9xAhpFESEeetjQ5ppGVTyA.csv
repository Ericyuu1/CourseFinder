40115863~COURSE!~9xAhpFESEeetjQ5ppGVTyA,1647449547736,1,0,"T​here is little to take away from this course other than the Information Entropy formula. The questions are poorly formatted (one of them asked to evaluate ""the following true false statement"" and the statement had no true false evaluation). 

The questions in the quizzes appear to have been given little though, and are primarily computation, or true false. There is little to actually unpack, and to even attempt to understand. 

The lecture styles aren't organized, or informative. The instructor either doesn't present enough, or presents too much, on a given topic, and when writing they often try to cram EVERYTHING at the end, rather than starting a new slide. I'd have apprecaited it more if, instead of cramming their handwriting, when they attempted to summarize a topic, like information entropy, that they'd switch to a slide that was neatly typed or written, which clearly expresses what they'd hope for us to take away from that series of slides.
