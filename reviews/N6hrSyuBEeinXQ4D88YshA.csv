4725254~COURSE!~N6hrSyuBEeinXQ4D88YshA,1647226304148,3,0,"T​here is important and valuable information included in this course, but the presentation wasn't alwasys engaging. Asking me to consistently go to another website was a little off-putting, especially when it asked me to register for a site or automatically downloaded documents I didn't necessarily want. I did like that there were a couple of actual patients and it would have been nice to hear from them more often. I also liked the use of ""what would you do"" questions when presented with a scenario. Although you could skip it, it was a good way to creatively think about how to handle situations.",0,0,Amber Dickerson,4725254
15509353~COURSE!~N6hrSyuBEeinXQ4D88YshA,1601571367232,3,0,"This course was interesting, well designed and the presentations were engaging. But this course was not as focused on minorities specifically compared to what I expected. A lot of the information given could be true across all ethnicities and is common knowledge if you work in trials. It would be useful to look more closely at the under represented ethnicities or cut out some of the 'generic' information to shorten the course. Also, a lot of the links for readings did not work, please check these regularly.",0,2,Katherine Patricia Joyce,15509353
