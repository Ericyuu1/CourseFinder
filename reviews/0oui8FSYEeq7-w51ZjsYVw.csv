6788826~COURSE!~0oui8FSYEeq7-w51ZjsYVw,1596679690442,4,0,"The course provides a good overview of the issues faced by ""southern countries"" as well as new perspectives on pathways that can lead to economic development that is decoupled with carbon trajectory. It also spotlights some of the systemic economic and financial paradigm shifts that are needed to achieve energy and environmental transition. I'd recommend this course both as a refresher for practitioners as well as those who are generally aware of the topic but are seeking to take their knowledge one level deeper.
