3455484~COURSE!~VWV2zdk7Eees4xJCvDoPAg,1627530948339,1,0,"The course is fine; what is NOT fine is the way that Coursera constantly tells you that you're ""late"" with the assignments. I audited the course. I wasn't ""late"". I took the quizzes. But Coursera doesn't give you credit for taking the quizzes unless you ""upgrade"". So, I did ALL the work, but cannot complete the course without paying? Then why let people audit the course? Totally stupid. ",0,0,Rick Wingender,3455484

61889439~COURSE!~VWV2zdk7Eees4xJCvDoPAg,1609228603330,4,0,"Great course. With 6 weeks of course material, one can't certainly expect a detailed understanding into the topic. However, it gives a good enough peek into the field to evoke curiosity and delve deeper into the world of Neuromarketing. I would recommend the course to anyone who is interested or works in a career where it is absolutely essential to understand how humans (and specifically, consumers) think.My only constructive criticism (and perhaps the reason for 1 less star) comes for the interview videos at the end of each week. While it is a great initiative to include industry leaders and experts in the field, what would provide more value to us is if they practically discuss a particularly significant case study of what they do (with examples, outputs and how it helped their clients to achieve their marketing objectives), rather than just providing an overview of implications of neuromarketing techniques to the world of marketing.",0,0,Aditya Phute,61889439
