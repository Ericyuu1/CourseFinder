38081183~COURSE!~FlRaIB09EeyZ9BL8TB78QQ,1658327271753,1,0,"Although the course is nicely put together, I found several shortcomings with it1) There is some inbalance in week 1. Though the whole course is really simple, the part on SSH and portforwarding, especially also in the lab assignment was complicated2) Because of my confusion in the lab assingment in week 1 I posed a question in the course forum. Unfortunately I did not get any response (no email anyway). Communication is for online courses key. That such was lacking here I found really disappointing3) There is a lab assignment in (I believe it was) week 1 that is literally repeated in a later week4) From week 3 onward the lab environment was missing linux commands like 'vim', although the instruction was to use 'vim'. In fact there was no linux editor at all, but the lab editor itself (which is ok of course, but then don't say we should use 'vim')5) One of the instructions in the lab of week 4 was downright false: it said to count the uniq occurrences, but it really did a count of the bytes involved. I believe the word was SUN, so 4 bytes including the EOL character, so 4 * the total number of SUN6) One last but important problem with the course: lack of stimulation. All the questions are way too simple, and practically all questions are already pre-answered.",0,3,Robert van der Kraan,38081183
108356559~COURSE!~FlRaIB09EeyZ9BL8TB78QQ,1660528925883,2,0,"The instructors definitely know their stuff but 'instruction' requires more than knowledge or how to apply a template formulated by supposed education specialists. As an example, there was a lot of ""...you can do this... and you could do that... and take a look at this and... "" when what was needed was ""... SSH stands for secure socket shell... "" and ""...it is called 'shell' because these environments are considered the 'outer-most' shell of the computer operating system which in this cas..."" bla bla. There is a reason why people who want to teach professionally go to school and learn about 'learning' and how humans learn things. Students reported errors (I too found some) - big and little ones.Be prepared if you take this and these other Duke Data Engineering courses to do a lot of figuring out of stuff on your own. Crowd sourced grading is not a good way to maintain and encourage ACCURACY at all. That's not a good use of such.This course is needed but the course itself needs to be changed to reflect standards in learning and training.",0,1,Lisa Rose,108356559

The instructor is a seasoned professional in film industry. He explained when and why to use what bash commands in an engaging and professional way.
