51279327~COURSE!~h-61H8VVEeiCWRL0859yPg,1590408592168,2,0,Not an easy course to follow with a lot of videos and reading etc.  I would of liked some different presenters and real life examples which would help to reach a wider learning audience. ,0,0,David Wadsworth,51279327
8212235~COURSE!~h-61H8VVEeiCWRL0859yPg,1588070322082,2,0,"The course themes are very interesting, as the optional material. However, I disagree with the no prior requirements: given the lessons method, it is necessary a well-above average level of mathematics, statistics and excel (when not directly Stata, which is not free and whose examples are not released). I also would have preferred a more engaging presentation style (too often the lessons seemed ""read"" speeches).Overall I would recommend this course to students and professionals with prior statistics knowledge and a specific desire to deepen their skills on workable models.",0,5,Alessandro Camnasio,8212235

85182995~COURSE!~h-61H8VVEeiCWRL0859yPg,1621777329844,4,0,"Interesting course with scientific methods to evaluate business innovation.  Could use more explanation and case studies to show students tangible results to develop and connect theory with practice, especially for those requiring or needing reinforcement from text lessons rather than video.  Some language doesn't convey principles well into English, but generally helpful and solid educational experience.  ",0,0,Jonathan Goldfarb,85182995
14334406~COURSE!~h-61H8VVEeiCWRL0859yPg,1593870345789,4,0,"It's a really well designed course and the objectives are out across quite clearly, which I think is very important for a course like this one. The only aspect that could have been better or could be made better is the explanation of terms. For me, personally, I had a hard time understanding the terminologies because I have learnt basic stats, so elaboration of the concepts in simpler language would be helpful which however depends on the target audience: If only managers with stats/math background are to take this course, I think everything is well laid out in the course.Thank you, I learnt quite a lot!",0,0,Anowyesha Dash,14334406
