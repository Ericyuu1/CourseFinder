67554567~COURSE!~ng-wV6BDEea7DQoksxKcjg,1673397891241,3,0,"We are learning about Planning for Climate Change in Africa Cities, so far the teachers re talking about the cities of the other countries around the world. Very few African cities in the course are talked about",0,0,J. Bryce,67554567
6372704~COURSE!~ng-wV6BDEea7DQoksxKcjg,1630072860354,3,0,"Not a bad course if it was named planning for climate change in urban environments.

30900179~COURSE!~ng-wV6BDEea7DQoksxKcjg,1598273507471,3,0,"Quite theoretical and I had expected more 'African' into the course: the African lecturers were very limited and only Kampala was used as an example, apart from some literature but mainly using Durban. But still a useful course to get 'all ducks in a row'. I also expressed caution in using the multi-criteria analysis tool in the final exercise in the way it is designed. I received certificate but do not manage to see what the peer reviewers said about the submission. Is that the intention?",0,0,Marieke de Groen,30900179

And it was all very applicable and real-life.  Thanks to the wonderful instructors. I wish I could have been in a classroom with you all.Please note that not all of the compulsory readings seemed to be immediately available, even for purchase.  It would have been great if all the compulsory readings were packaged or collated and available for a fee.
