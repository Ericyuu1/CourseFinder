I had to think outside the box to answer the questions, to fill in the blank spaces. Although I like challenges to answer those questions you need some background in order to answer them or simply guessPros: Even though the chapter quizzes required critical thinking, some of it was included in the lecture, but  mostly it had me thinking twice about everything, about what I thought was right and what actually was right. What I perceived was right wasn't so in Chapter 7, the rest were predictable.Overall, I was fortunate to be listing to Emperor of Maladies at the time, so it made sense, I think if I wasn't listening to it at the same time I wouldn't be so enthusiastic to learn it nor would it have made sense.

The course is all about testing the screening method, and not so much what KINDS of tests are in use for say, COVID-19.   What tests are in use today for screening diseases and how do they work ?   That is not in this course.  That said, once you realize this course does not go anywhere near what disease tests actually do, and you are locked in to the course then yes it is very useful.  Public health professionals accept reliability of the 2 types of COVID-19 screenings, and have their hands full completing the task of disease screening of the public for virus and, since most screening is by off the shelf purchases from pharmaceutical companies, twho is the audience intended for this course?   It seems to me this course would be most useful for screening test designers at the Pharmaceuticals.  It is for inventors of screening tests, who want to verify reliability, before put their screening test on the market, for public health agencies.  The coursed was challenging and very interesting once you accept that the course is about, testing the tests.  Thank you.",0,1,Bryan Ferrick,55794402
