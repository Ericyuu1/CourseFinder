This course helped me actually implement various algorithms and concepts related to graphs and at the same time gave me lots of new insights and understandings into why certain things are the way they are with proofs given by the Instructors which is something I quite like about these HSE and UC San Diego courses, the lengths they go to prove every statement/lemma. Every professor explained concepts in a clear and concise way which not gonna lie was quite a problem in previous courses in this Specialization (I'm looking at you David Kane).
