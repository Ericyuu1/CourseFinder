67113135~COURSE!~ZirObu41EeqfJAoS4XpEuQ,1615491287042,1,0,I’m upset that I’m considered “overdue” in this course because I haven’t reviewed 3 of my peers. How am I supposed to review  3 peers if there are not three peer assignments? And what happened to the peer review I did on Feb. 22nd? It seems to have disappeared! If there are not three peer assignments by the course deadline that should NOT be my problem!,0,0,Amelia Brown,67113135

Make it more measurable and don't put you can finish as fast as you could. Because it is not real. even though we finish early, we have to wait forever. You are doing the peer review so people would get stuck and pay a monthly subscription or encourage other people to join your course. You guys just want to suck money out of people. Horrible! Horrendous!",0,0,Anonymous Anonymous,75189159

I have also learnt to relate well with my children by giving them the opportunity to give their own opinion unlike before that I do impose my will on them. The content of the course is very rich",0,0,Adeniyi Michael Makanjuola ,116089168
