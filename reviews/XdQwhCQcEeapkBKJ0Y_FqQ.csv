I think a native English speaker should have been employed to look over the subtitles, and especially the quiz questions. There were times where the wrong word with a completely different meaning was used in these contexts, for example I got a quiz question wrong because one answer used the word 'treat' instead of 'trait'. The quizzes were tricky because often all the answers seemed correct, with only subtle differences of meaning between them, that meaning being slightly distorted by the wrong choice of words at times.

very much for this great course! I
especially liked:(1) The dense content each week, (2) The diversity of cultural
     institutions covered during the course, (3) The positive and
     engaging attitude of Professor Andrea Rurale. I would
suggest the following improvements:(1) There should be more case
     studies immediately after the presentation of theoretical models. There
     were many models presented each week, and too few opportunities to
     actually apply them to concrete cases to make sure they are understood and
     to help memorize them. Sometimes there were too many lists of concepts and
     not enough practical tips. (2) Perhaps 1 or 2 peer
     assignments should be compulsory to obtain the certificate? Not taking
     into account any grade - just to encourage participation in the peer
     exercises. (3) I found the music at the

The visual aids are excellent and the interviews are great, perhaps you should consider them to include them along with each module instead of at the end.
