For busy clinicians like me, I found the online, learn-at-your-own pace model very helpful and convenient, and well worth the affordable price. Most importantly, you DO NOT need to learn about coding or python. But I would advise you follow up on the recommended readings prescribed at the end of each week's talk. Of course, there is a bias towards American healthcare in Module 1, but this makes for interesting reading and an appreciation of the weaknesses and strengths of US health system. I only hope that regular updates on Machine Learning could be provided every 2 years or so to past participants, similarly online, as this field is ever-evolving and changing. I would not mind paying for it.",0,4,Siang-Hiong Goh,82867610

I took the first version of the class and it has a few rough edges (grading mistakes, odd questions, missing instructions, data formatting).  Even with the rough spots, the class was a thought provoking experience that required the background of the courses provided, but it also required some outside AI education and experience to come up with answers.  Although I have some differences in the approach chosen by the instructors on some topics such as bias, the material is invaluable.",0,0,Philip Lieberman,38398766
