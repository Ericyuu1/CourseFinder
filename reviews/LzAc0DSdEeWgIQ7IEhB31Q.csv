This course has helps me come to the realization that we can both be right; instead, what should be focused on is whether our choice brings improvements to the life of other people. I gain more confidence in my beliefs, and at the same time I come to understand more and learn to accept the beliefs of others.I​n a more direct way to say this, I become more optimistic with my life and find it easier to talk to my parents even though we differ a lot in our ideologies.A​gain, I want to send my sincere gratitude to Professor Bloom and all of the people who had worked hard to share this insightful knowledge to the mass, regardless of their background, ethnicity or education.More than ever, I believe in the power of knowledge and the reasoning mind when it comes to creating a better life for ourselves and our societies.",0,0,Vu Tran Quynh Huong,86909212

The TED lectures were great but I'm curious as to why all the chosen TED lectures were given by men! Maybe males are primary lecturers in morality these days?

The discussion groups were well organized and the 'office hours', while dated from 2014 and 2015 were fascinating and funny. All in all, this course was well worth my time and effort.

This does not revolve around religion and spirituality or one particular aspect of morality- though, it should be said, those are touched upon throughout this course.

My interest in the relationship between psychiatric disorders, sociocultural acquisitions and moral systems has increased. Then I had the opportunity to evaluate in detail the evolutionary and existential mechanisms of moral statuses. Then I realized that my thoughts and curiosity began to change in response to the etiology and factors of this scheme. Do moral systems and moral judgments in evolutionary psychology have a relationship with neurobiology in psychological disorders? What are the criteria and determinants of this relationship, if any?
My acquisition of this question was through the vision of this course.
When I finished Disgust and Honor I and Disgust and Honor II, when I evaluated the research results and perspectives supported by scientific paradigms, I wanted to place and explore a different parameter in this relationship
Since I am going to do my master's degree in clinical psychology, I observed that the group where I can study moral systems and disgust behaviors in the clinic is OCD patients ... As a result of my literature study of antecedents, reaction sizes, distinguishing points and possible explanations that measure disgust behavior, I thought that there may be a certain relationship and difference in disgust behavior and imagery among ocd individuals with different moral systems.
This course has contributed greatly to me asking this question at this point.

Professor Bloom is so engaging, and the combination of his energy, knowledge, and range of topics touched-upon in the course were engaging, stimulating and inspiring. I will be fifty in August, and have wanted to return to some sort of academic endeavor since I graduated from law school, in 2001. I simply couldn't afford it, and I did not have the time - first, because I was practicing law, and then, because I was injured and then a cascade of medical issues followed (and still exist). I have not felt intellectually stimulated on this level for many years; and I have not felt both excited about delving into something truly educational and able to start and follow something important to me through to completion for a very long time. This course was fascinating, and touched upon areas I would not have thought a course on this subject matter would. The lecture by Laurie Santos was absolutely wonderful. The balance of philosophy and psychology; religion and politics; science and emotion; and more all presented a course that provided just enough of everything to leave me wanting to delve in further. I can honestly say that I will be ordering books from Professor Bloom, from Singer, and from others discussed during the course. I enrolled in Professor Bloom's ""Introduction to Psychology"" course (I used to represent psychiatric in-patients briefly, too briefly, in New York, and have wanted to return to working with the mentally ill for a very long time), and am just beginning the third week. It is not often that one comes across both a professor and subject matter that keep one engaged simultaneously. And for many like me, it is quite something to find someone like Professor Bloom, and to find a course, or a body of knowledge in any form, that can inspire so much, and in so little time. The benefit of a six-week course has been something that will have a lifelong effect. This is rather a more personal, perhaps emotional, review, than one discussing just the academia and what has been learned, in and of itself. To me, though, that speaks to how wonderful the course and the professor are have been. I am ever grateful.",0,0,Tara Gellman,52941852

It would have been great to have had Sartre over here, or Camus, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche or Freud...  There was only some small references to Kant, Adam Smith and others, but, in general, there was very little about philosophy (and that's funny in a course about moralities!). The quizzes are great but a bit too long (20 questions each). The Office hours are interesting but also very long (some are more than 45 minutes). I also missed more teachers lecturing and more interviews. But, overall, it is an excellent course. Thanks a lot and greetings from Madrid! / Antonia Tejeda Barros",0,9,Antonia Tejeda Barros,33033402

I'm Mexican, and almost at the end of the course it was September 19th, the day a huge earthquake shook Mexico City and other neighboring cities, causing hundreds of deaths and a lot of material damages. As civilians and government were trying to cope with the disaster, a lot of moral decisions had to be made. Should we sacrifice the life of someone still trapped not to put in danger more lifes? Should civilians trust the government in rescue missions when government is basically untrusted in all other decision-making fields? Was empathy causing irrational decisions? Why was it that people were more willing to help their neighbors than other people in the same situation or even worse but geographically further? This course allowed me to explore some answers to these questions and have a better understanding of what was going on. For that and other reasons I strongly and sincerely recommend everyone taking this course. ",0,5,Alejandro Joseph Esteinou,13823542
