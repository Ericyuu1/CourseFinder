273302~COURSE!~0m0BGLW_EeiltQrMgsfOHg,1666016297555,5,0,"I​ found this course very helpful in allowing me to gain insights some of the problems that can arise following  a natural or human created emergency. I have taken courses related to the needs of  local and country-wide populations following  humanitarian crises.; however, few of the courses have focused on those with chronic conditions. The course provided me with scenarios that other than the very obvious, visible  problems such as potable water, food, sanitation and shelter that I may not have considered.  I feel that this course has made me realize just how complex these situations truly are and I have have realized that like the proverbial iceberg, in a complex emergency, there are many factors that contrubute to an emergency both good and bad that lie below the surface hidden by the obvious, visible and pressing needs in these types of scenarios. I like to think of it as an extra layer of critical thinling.",0,0,MIchael William Bright,273302
