Another issue is that old assignments are still in circulation for reviews - I have been asked to review 2 assignments that were posted in 2017! It's now 2022.

This is true of all Coursera's writing courses.  There are NO moderators, although it appears there are.  Years ago, Coursera shifted from a cohort-structured (everyone starts and stops at the same time together) to a rolling enrollment model, where people can start anytime.  I see the benefit to the latter, but in the former model, I was in a course with a number of students and we stayed together throughout the various modules of that course. We got to know each other's writings. We actually created learning groups within the class.  It was amazing.  No one is checking in on the courses.  That allows one to receive feedback that is actually nonexistent.  For example, in one course, here is the feedback I receivey11Yes that was the three sets of feedback I received for one assignment. All three students received credit for this feedback.  It wasn't the first time I received the number ""1"" as feedback.Now the rolling enrollment model means you rarely see the same writer's work which doesn't allow the writer to have a reader who watches them evolve and provides feedback in a meaningful way.Many of the questions asked by the instructor in the feedback were close-ended questions which meant students could provide simply a yes or no responses.

El poder tener una retroalimentación por parte de los pares del curso es muy enriquecedor, tanto para la persona que la recibe como para la persona que la hace.

Incluso en mi última tarea, que para mí fue la más importante, recibí retroalimentación de una persona que simplemente colocó ""Yes"" en todas las casillas.

Nor do the instructional materials focus on such issues.  After giving some very good but brief advice about the basis of plot, they move on to other matters: narrative structure, show vs. tell, the elements of a good scene, how to edit a finished work--all worthwhile, but peripheral to the stated theme of plot.

113872782~COURSE!~3KNgoXgcEeWrAxJQXw-8PQ,1662543334337,5,0,"TL;DR If you are thinking twice reading bad reviews, just enroll it. If you want to know why, read on.

Course Content - I have read a ton of articles on writing fiction and was familiar with the concepts such as Freytag's Pyramid etc. even before enrolling the course. However, the way the content is delivered, the choice of words during lecture videos and the way the assignments are structured will really help you a great deal. So,  even when they say the content are basics, it is still very helpful.

Lecturer - I adore him! His voice and the way he delivers speech is very concise and clear. You wouldn't feel sleepy or boring. His examples are top-notch. I would enroll any other course by him if there is any.

Assignments - It's structured perfectly. I read in forums that some find it difficult for certain prompts but that is the point of these exercises. If you want to be a professional fiction writer, you should be able to write more often, not only when you are in full mood and these exercises would help you with that a lot. On top of that, each assignment is really coherent with what the course has delivered. 

Peer Review - It is unfair to say that this course is bad just because you don't get graded by the lecturer. There are a ton of courses out there where the lecture would personally grade your works, on Oxford continuing educaiton, Standford online courses etc. The point is those courses would cost you from 500 USD to 1,200 USD. So if you are looking for valid feedback, go for these courses.

I did see that some complaint about peer reviewers who didn't make any effort. And sadly, that's how the world is. Try not to be one of them. Review other works as you would want your works to be reviewed.  Don't say all nice things just to encourage them. Point out what's lacking but do it politely.

A paractical tip that worked for me is that instead of just reviewing what the system promopted in peer review tab, go to the discussion forum and review those posted by the writers. When they post their assignment links in the forum, it means they are more serious than others. And after you reviewed them, you can reply your link and request them to review so that you would give more constructive feedbacks than random ones. You could also post it in forum yourself.

Don't be discouraged by those who just filled up one letter for each box. Or those who do not seem to understand what fiction is.  For example, for one of my assignments, two reviewers said the inciting incident was placed properly while another said s/he couldn't find it.

However, take constructive feedbacks seriously. Some really made the effort to give you proper feedback so listen to them.

Summary - This is a course worth enrolling. And another tip. If you want the cerificate but don't want to pay, try the free trial. It would give you the full course including certs for a week. I finished this course in six days though it is supposed to be one month course. You can cancel your free trial once you've downloaded the certificate. Hope this helps!

BEWARE!The app nor the online through google chrome do not work well when set up for the visually impaired.

If you are like me and don't have the type of job where you can write or even view your course while working, this can be time consuming.

After taking Brando's course, I believe the biggest weakness in each story was my failure to appreciate not only plot generally, but the finer points he discusses here: show, don't tell; the five-act story; the 21 points of editing, and so forth. I've read Stephen King's ""On Writing,"" but too often have dismissed the valuable information therein. Brando's course, both his own teaching and the valuable interviews, I know will make me a better storyteller and, will help me write compelling, plot-driven stories.
