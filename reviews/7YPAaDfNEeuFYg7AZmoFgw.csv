82996281~COURSE!~7YPAaDfNEeuFYg7AZmoFgw,1616143260670,4,0,"This was a good course.  I followed right through an instructor verbalises all her actions just before she does them, which prompted me to be alert where her cursor was and so that I could follow through.  Her pace was gentle and she always gave rational.  I had several prompts to update VSCode which were disturbing at times to understand what to do.  Second challenge was in the 3rd lesson my filepath chosen was Desktop/ only but not Desktop/project so I cold not follow to create my pdf and this affected the last lesson but just a bit.  I could not manage to create my API Documentation although I managed to create my API Key.  I am very grateful for this and I can come back to try again.  I hope this feedback was helpful. Thanks.",0,0,Vimbai Kurewa,82996281
