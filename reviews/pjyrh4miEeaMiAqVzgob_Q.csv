119030508~COURSE!~pjyrh4miEeaMiAqVzgob_Q,1672014229642,2,0,"I was excited to take this class, but upon completion, I can't say that I learned much at all. The course tends to focus on interviews/history of events in synthetic biology without spending nearly enough time on the overarching theme on why they are ethical issues. It's OK to teach the history of the field as a way to better understand the present, but the purpose of learning ethics is so that we can understand how we should handle these issues in the present and the future, which this class seemed to miss. There were also lots of editing mistakes where the professor seemed to pause and readjust herself for a post-edit that never came. In one video, there were two different audio segments that overlapped each other throughout almost the entire lecture. This is not a course I would recommend to anyone.",0,0,Caleb Symmonds,119030508
