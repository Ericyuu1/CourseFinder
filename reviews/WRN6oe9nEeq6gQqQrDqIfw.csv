It would have been helpful if the course explained the functions which were used: ""lambda"" for example. Among others, one of the main point stems from a final quiz question regarding ""for loops"". The question requires the student to select which option generates an error. Although the user is required to select one answer only, 3 out of the 4 options generate syntax errors due to missing closing parentheses, or colons. ",0,0,Mohamad Jaber,43996493
