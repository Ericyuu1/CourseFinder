2203599~COURSE!~qpc6hYZNEeaG-BL9miwwYw,1596802370107,1,0,"I do not recommend this course if you're intending to learn any deep concepts.1) The course instructors look like they don't want to be there, and are basically present to read from a script. The slides are next to useless because they barely help illustrate anything the instructors say. Week 4 on vacuum technologies is the worst: I could barely make out many important terms. Even the transcripts describe many words/phrases as ""unintelligible"" and no one from the course team has decided to fix the transcripts to at least help with how incomprehensible things already are. 2) Much of the content is shallow, so you learn a bunch of names/terms but there is no attempt to help you understand concepts or principles. Most of the videos have no link to one another, and they don't even try and show you how the things they mention fit in together on a whole. A very simple thing to do would have been to provide a summary with a quick comparison at the end of each section of all the objects/technology that have been touched upon.3) Answering quiz questions will involve a bunch of guess work because videos are mainly terrible at describing and explaining.

I recommend this course for all users of accelerators who want to know the basics of the facilities they are using. If we can have improvements in a few points, it would be better even more.Typos: There are a lot of typos in the subtitles and quizzes.Additional explanations: Week 4 would be better if it contains reading materials on the additional details.

Only drawback was that there was a bit of gap between the spoken lectures and the more mathematical reading sections. If there were more materials which helped take the reader from the basic concepts all the way to the more rigorous mathematical forms, that would be really great. Overall a really good course, especially considering its free. ",0,0,,73624245

52952224~COURSE!~qpc6hYZNEeaG-BL9miwwYw,1586835919558,4,0,"I am a vacuum scientist at a light source and I used this course to fill gaps in my knowledge.  For instance, the RF and magnet sections were very helpful because I do not interact with these systems often and I have not had to learn much about them thus far.However, I noticed some gaps between quiz questions and the videos and there were small inaccuracies in the information given.  For instance, the vacuum instructor called a Pirani gauge a cold cathode gauge after discussing Pirani gauges under the umbrella of thermal gauges.  To give another example, the question pertaining to beam coordinates gave five parameters rather than the needed si (probably just a typographic error).  I did not find any gaps or inconsistencies stifling but someone with less experience in the field might.Is there any possibility of more advanced in-depth modules?  It would be very nice to have, say, five weeks on RF systems.  ",0,1,Yev Lushtak,52952224
