Some of the multiple choice questions were very tricky and take several attempts to get right. Some the the computing assignments required a specific number to be entered for the final answer.  This was sometimes quite difficult because there was not much room for error.

To further improve the MOOC, I suggest: - Provide more complementary materials as conditional readings (e.g. good books and articles on the topic), - Don't try to teach Python in 1 hour, rather make it a prerequisite for the MOOC instead and use that module to deepen the real subject: modeling, - Review the coverage of ODEs and PDEs, the explanations provided are either too confused or high-level.
