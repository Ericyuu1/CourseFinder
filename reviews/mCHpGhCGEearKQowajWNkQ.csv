56405068~COURSE!~mCHpGhCGEearKQowajWNkQ,1594842149771,4,0,"Until last week, I was extremely happy to be taking this course. Especially that it's online and available during these strange covid-19 times. But I am experiencing another aspect of the course that's putting another light on taking it: In the midst of my life tasks and responsibilities, and longing to simply get back to actually painting, all the many otherwise worthy Coursera homework assignments in the ""In the Studio"" course are becoming overwhelming to keep up with, or even to try. So I've mostly given up on doing the readings, and am right now just trying to watch as many of the videos as I can manage. I'm trying to relax the tension I feel around the pink exclamation (!) mark that appears when I get an answer wrong on a test. And trying to just learn, and enjoy whatever I can manage to do in the course.I have yet to actually do one of the painting exercises, which I thought would be great to learn from and the reason I signed up. I'm basically just trying to get off the computer so I can paint more, hopefully, with ideas and inspiration from Corey D'Augustine's instruction.***I am wondering if all the artists we are learning about--Pollack, Milne and others--went through intensive academic instruction and testing, and whether they took intellectual learning of facts, and tests and grading as important, or even relevant to their work, other than as an intellectual restrictions to see beyond and go beyond.***What I am suggesting is that you offer the choice of another way of going through the course, more experientially, without the intellectual demands and academic grading and punitive feedback; for artists and others who have genuine interest in the material. I'm sure Coursera is not aware of that as part of their art presentation, but it is. For anyone like myself, who did not have an easy time in school (and in liberal arts college and grad school programs), the grading and automated harsh feedback is unpleasant and counter to an artist's work and life. And it reawakens memories of how difficult a time I had in school. I, like many other artists, used to think I must be lazy or unintelligent, and it's taken many years to realize I am intelligent and just need to be in and create an environment that suits my artistic style. Academic punitiveness is not something that we should be having to deal with again as adults, and certainly not during these difficult covid-19 times. More spaciousness, choices and kindness are needed, in particular, around the Coursera testing feedback and homework.I wonder if this academic conventional strictness is so ingrained in the culture that it might be invisible to those in academia?Otherwise, it's a great course. And Corey D-Augustine is a great teacher.I hope this response can be read and considered in future programming. Thank you very much for asking for feedback, and for this otherwise really excellent course. ",0,0,Deleted Account,56405068

Not only did it provide a great release and distraction during the COVID-19 pandemic, but it provided such a fun and interactive way to really learn about some of the great abstract expressionist artists from the NY school of painting.   The class was equally balanced between a hands-on experience of painting in each respective artists' style, and with videos and articles to familiarize us with each artist.   I would highly recommend this course for any budding artist or ""soccer mom"" or student who has the desire and time  to roll up their sleeves and learn and play with some of the great abstract artists of our time.

I do not paint but I make collage our of fabrics so the use of colour, perspective, depth, layering have influenced in how I approach my work.

It seems most artists post-war used oils, but I am an acrylics painter, and acrylics i brought home from my studio at the start of the Quarantine were more accessible. I also would not want to use oils in front of my apartment building if I even had them. I also had a limited supply of canvas and didn't want to use what I had on projects, that while fun, would leave me without canvas for my own work. Regardless, it was such a great opportunity  to have had this time for this course, the supplies were the trade off in such unusual circumstances. All of this aside, what a fantastic course, and Corey was amazing. Even just watching him demo how painters created their paintings was fascinating to watch and such a rare opportunity .

There were however techniical  glitches that were annoying. Some pages of required reading would not load and instructions how to upload assignments are not very clear.  It wasnt stated very clearly to me that the final assiessments  track 1 and 2 were either or choices.  I was in the process of working on track 2 when i was notified i had completed the course. Most disappointing to me is that there is no feedback concerning how well i reviewed my peers essays.  There  is also a workflow flaw in the grading page for peer review of essays. The grading section appears BEFORE the box for comments. When you complete grading and hit SUBMIT, you will lose the chance to type comments and post them to the student because the comments box disappears.  i think most people do not realise this so many students may receive a grade but not the comments. With the current system,  the comments must be typed and posted , BEFORE completing the grade marking.  You will also not see the POST button until you start typing comments. This page has got to change. i realised this problem because i reviewed 3 essays and experienced the problem with the first essay i graded. It was a shame because this student did remarkably well but did not get my comments. For the other 2 i, i posted the comments before submitting the grades.I received 95% grade for my  ownessay.  When i referred to my assgnment page for more details,  i discovered that the box for 90% had been crossed out in red and  "" 95% tie""  typed in.

22964919~COURSE!~mCHpGhCGEearKQowajWNkQ,1497882034614,5,0,"This was my second attempt at a Coursera course and it widely exceeded my expectations - the first was in a technology arena and the technology for doing homework assignments never worked. This class is exceptionally well thought out and executed, particularly for someone such as myself who has never had any painting experience.  Corey D""Augustine has that rare gift of an instructor who intuitively knows what the student needs in order to advance through a concept.  The class begins with the absolute basics, starting with how to stretch a canvas, prime a canvas and then through the different types of paint and tools needed.  The class progresses to increasingly more complicated forms of painting in the style of postwar abstract expressionism.I thoroughly enjoyed how each week progresses through one artist after another with the opportunity to do a painting in the style of that artist.  Each module does a superb and consistent job of presenting the artist's major works, the philosophy and history and then the techniques through a demonstration.  It is great to be able to upload a photo of your effort and then see and react to what other students have done.  The quiz at the end of each module help to reinforce the lessons learned for that module.In the end, I found that I could paint paintings in the style of the postwar abstract expressionists - something I never thought possible.  To the student with little or no experience with painting, especially oils, the mere mixing of paint and applying it to a canvas can be intimidating - this instructor effectively moves the student away from those hesitations. More importantly, I will likely never look a painting in a museum with a more critical eye than I now have for this style of art and, I can now articulate why I have always enjoyed this period of art history.  Well done Corey!",0,4,Peter Rigby,22964919
