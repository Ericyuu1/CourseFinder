82638919~COURSE!~AiHGv3FcEeuGxgrFdetpfQ,1622495839701,5,0,I enjoyed this course and would recommend to others. The instructor was so good at guiding students by explaining each steps in detailed. He explained the reasons why we carry this specific step and showed the logic behind the processing. Unlike the last course I took in Coursera which the instructor only repeated the script and explained nothing.,0,1,Yongyu He,82638919
