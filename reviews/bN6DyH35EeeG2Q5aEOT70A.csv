68637~COURSE!~bN6DyH35EeeG2Q5aEOT70A,1529321613545,1,0,"That's one of those ""one size fits all"" attempts that end up not fitting anyone. If you don't know machine learning, you're not going to learn beyond mimicking examples of H20 code, which you could do for free by the way, using (way better) resources available on the web (H20's GitHub is a good resource). The instructor's attempts to provide intuitions on the machine learning algorithms are lazy at best. If you don't know any machine learning, you will likely get extremely confused. If you know any machine learning, you will cringe: they are just plain awful. The man didn't put much effort into this course. When things get tricky to explain, he simply excuses himself from doing it and provides Wikipedia links... Also in an attempt to reach an audience as large as possible, the instructor didn't even commit to one programming language for the course... The man goes back and forth between R and Python, half-assing both of them. He could have at least had the courtesy of providing this course's code somewhere on the web. I spent the majority of my time in this course pausing videos and typing the code from the screen... On top of everything, there are no instructors nor mentors answering to questions in the discussion forum. I took the first iteration of this course and I have seen maybe ten messages, most of them directed to the instructor and no answers whatsoever. Lastly, take in consideration that the assignments are peer-graded. I think that there is a high probability that you won't be able to get enough reviews to pass this course if you take later iterations. The number of people taking this course seem rather small.",0,4,Marcio Gualtieri,68637

The course not only helped understand various machine learning models but also improved my programming skills. Even the tests and peer graded assignments were not simple and direct. You had to refer to the documentations and look all over the internet. It was a good course and I must recommend this to anyone who is interested in machine learning and data analytics. You would not only know more about machine learning but learn how to use h2o, which is a very powerful tool that could be used in python and R. ",0,0,Neil Bhutada,41642315

It is very easy to setup, load and analyze data, helps in moving fast and get insights quickly.
