The teachers, while it is clear that they are very knowledgeable in their fields, fill their lectures with unnecessary jargon. I'm not sure if they are primarily researchers who aren't used to teaching or if they are only used to teaching students who are far advanced enough that the vocabulary of those fields are second nature to them. As someone who was taking this class without that advantage, I was quickly lost among all the jargon, to the point where I just had to stop.

There is a lot of jumping about in some sections, which can make the flow of ideas more difficult. However, the scope of the course was amazing and it whetted my appetite for things paleontological! In most Sections I did a great deal of background research on the internet to get more information to help me understand some of the ideas. I like the honesty of the lecturers. They dont present evolution as a fait accompli - in fact quite the opposite. They acknowledge many significant gaps in the fossil record, and often point out that everything is hypothesis and theory, which changes steadily over time as new discoveries are made. Thank you for stimulating my interest over the summer period.",0,0,Philip Keith,84418128
1362877~COURSE!~QRDjcWLVEeWFkQ7sUCFGVQ,1624462677969,4,0," This course gives an overview of the main themes in the origin story of the universe, the solar system, earth, life, and the humankind. This is a grand journey, and necessarily the course moves very rapidly touching on only selected topics. 

However, I personally struggled to keep up with the torrent of information that was presented, especially given my lack of background in this area. Often it felt as if the course focused on the trees instead of the forests. I found myself losing touch with most of the information of a lecture as soon as the lecture was over. It's challenging to pick out the important pieces of information from the ones that are not. There is no doubt that the educators in this course are experts in their fields, but I felt that sometimes they were oblivious to the challenges faced by complete strangers to their area. 

Perhaps Coursera could stretch out this course over a series of courses, each examining a specific topic at a more leisurely pace?  

But even so, it's very useful as an overview. I think this course best serves as a scaffolding for us to build on further with specialized studies. I expect to build on this foundation further in the coming months and years, as I piece together for myself the story of our origins. This course is a great start to that journey!",0,0,Arun Vasudev,1362877

Presented in an easy to understand and follow format, most of the information is picked up easily with visual presentations and little supplementary reading, but, for the person who absorbs information in text there is enough information provided this way as well...The lectures are great, a couple of the lecturers have accents which can be difficult to understand if you are not that way inclined, but there are real time transcripts which are adequate, the player can be stopped, paused, rewind, read-out-loud etc, and a section for easy note-taking also. Not my preferred method of learning as I cant ask the lecturer any questions (typical of lectures I've attended in person anyway) and there is no tutorial classes-but the discussion board and recommended reading  plus using my brain, doing extra research for more details etc does suffice.  The other thing I'm not sure if I like or not, is the nature of the examination. I love the questions embedded in the lectures, this is a fantastic way to reinforce information recall etc, but to not be able to present reasoning for an answer is very frustrating, and with up-dated information and differences in wording or grammar styles between countries as well as the various cultures of learning , this can be a little annoying, but not enough to ruin my thorough enjoyment of the course.

I liked very much how the order of subjects where build. However, if you allow me to give a *constructive* criticism, please let me say that the strategy chosen to ask lectures to read from previous written scripts, instead of letting them present more naturally, was a bad one. I understand that in order to make the legends/captions available, the lecturers kinda read from scripts their talks and this was very bad. It would be much better next time if you allow each speaker give the talk naturally as they want, with no reading, and then latter produce the subtitles. The lecturers are reseachers and not ACTORS so the final result of reading word by word what they were saying compromised a lot the final quality of their talks.

50320263~COURSE!~QRDjcWLVEeWFkQ7sUCFGVQ,1595696308426,5,0,"Excellent course! This is covering a HUGE amount of  science, so the brushes used are obviously very broad, but I would really  love to have the option  of taking a full degree using  this as a general guideline, perhaps studying  four of  the topics each year, and  going into much greater depth. All of the tutors seem to be well  grounded in their topics, and although some reviewers have complained about the technical language, it is up to the student to pause the video, and check the word's meaning  - it only takes a moment to look up the meanings on-line! I felt that this course could make a great  introduction to students considering  a science degree course . Obviously it is not as demanding as any degree would be, but it would give a taste of so many topics, and an idea of the necessary  self discipline that is often absent from school based study.  Another study ""group"" for UK students may be post GCSE, as it might lead to a science based student selecting a Physical or Biological preference for A Levels. This really is a great course for those looking to broaden their scientific knowledge, or those looking to identify the field of science that they would like to concentrate upon in the future.

Next course! Thank you all for a fascinating look into soooo many things !!   :)Stephen",0,0,Stephen Carroll,8773905

It is great to have such a diverse group of lecturers, everyone of whom know that material very well; they are great presenters also.If I had been asked, before I took the course, about summarizing 4 billion years in 10 weeks (400 million years per week), I'd have said it was impossible. These guys actually did it, and they did it well!I like the overlap between lectures, as each lecturer had their own style, and sometimes a topic was covered from two different perspectives, which reinforced my knowledge.I'm only sorry that I can't give this course more than 5 stars!",0,0,Simon Crase,8023553
