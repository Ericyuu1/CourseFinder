It seemed the instructors were only reading everything they presented; it was awkward and utterly boring. Moreover, the types of quizzes provided in this course sucked; they demanded memorization instead of promoting critical thinking. The fill-in-the-blanks items requiring the exact terms (e.g., tracking information vs gathering information) were the worse. Situational questions promoting discussions and critical thinking could have been provided to assess learnings. Simulations could have also been added. Further, presentations could have been made visually engaging. ",0,1,Gladys Agustin,106504959
