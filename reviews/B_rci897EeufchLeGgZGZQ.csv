33390915~COURSE!~B_rci897EeufchLeGgZGZQ,1674497657771,1,0,"Everything that follows, is just my own personal opinion, if not stated otherwise. It is based on my observations and interactions with teaching staff in the course discussion forums (for the last few months).
This is a very poorly executed course.
As of today (23 Jan 2023) this course for me still does not meet the criteria of a ""good resource for learning"" the basics of Linux CLI and shell scripting (despite few minor improvements already applied).
Some of the topics are hastily skimmed through in the videos, and almost no mechanism presented in the course is thoroughly explained.
Many of the ""basic concepts"" for Bash (and other modern shells) like e.g. function definitions, proper error handling, etc., are not even included in the course.
The importance of using correct quotations for variable/parameter expansions is also never mentioned nor explained, although it should be considered essential ""best practice"".
Peer-graded Final Assignment instructions/""guide"" contains some errors and not fully tested solutions, advertised as ""working correctly"".
The similar can be said about grading rubrics for the final assignment - which additionally are not focused on the actual results of the code execution, but instead they're focused on the code ""looks"", as in its visual resemblance (being as close to ""identical"" as possible) to what the course's staff have written in the grading rubrics.
In some cases, if the teaching staff finds a question in a discussion forum a bit more ""inconvenient"" for them to answer (or they're not fully capable of providing the correct answer to it in a timely manner?), then they would rather:
a) ignore the question completely (the least they can do is to not get involved at all) or reply with something similar to: ""we'll investigate the issue and get back to you"" (the latter ""get back to you"" almost never happens for a ""more complicated"" question);
b) reply with some irrelevant, impractical, incorrect, or otherwise unuseful information;
c) politely ask, to not bring the subject up ever again, as it may ""overwhelm the learners"";
d) delete the post (most often containing a valid, correct answer to the question) from discussion forums (I see censorship as ""means of hiding incompetence""?)
e) repeat other learner's correct answer (sometimes only slightly modifying it);
f) and also (occasionally) delete any relevant corrections (made by more knowledgeable learners) to previous staff's posts/replies;
than admit to any mistakes in the course contents, admit to lack of expertise in the subject matter, and address the questions properly - e.g. by allowing open discussion on potential improvements to the course materials, and implementing all said improvements as soon as possible (after reviewing).
These practices have been reported, and as I was assured by the Coursera Support Team, this kind of inappropriate teaching staff's behaviors will be escalated further, so I'm awaiting next developments of the situation.
But I still think this kind of inappropriate behaviors are a clear example, of what gives (or rather should give) the Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online (employers for the most of ""teaching staff"") a bad reputation.
This also might give Coursera courses and IBM Skills Network a really bad publicity in a long-run.
Teaching and following ""best practices"", and answering doubts with relevant, thorough, technical knowledge in the discussion forums of this course... is something you unlikely/rarely find coming from the teaching staff.
Generally, teaching staff don't seem to be fit for the job of thoroughly explaining the course materials and teaching the proper ""understanding"" of your mistakes (as hard as they try to be seen ""cooperative""),
but as I see it, they're better suited for
a) only requesting you to ""copy and paste"" their code samples, that they believe should work best as a ""correct solution"" in their opinions (side note, again, ""my opinion"" - their code doesn't work all that great, and is not written with all the ""best practices"" in mind) and 
b) deleting ""inconvenient"" posts from the discussion forums whenever they please.
To sum it up: in its current form, and with its current teaching staff replying in the discussion forums, I'd definitely not recommend this course to anyone, especially beginners. And I'd discourage seeking any ""great"" learning experience from Skill-Up Technologies Pvt. Ltd. / SkillUp Online - thus I'd strongly suggest searching for some other, better resources on the subjects regarding basics of working with Linux CLI and shell scripting.
