Being a graphic designer myself for 36 years, I can understand the instructors approaching the course from the actual graphic design standpoint as that is his background. There was much more that could have been included as far as lectures and even reading. There could have been more UI/UX design theory, fundamentals and principles taught. Going to the forums to get a question answered by an instructor in the interest of learning more or understanding something, forget it. I think 95% of the questions asked don’t get answered.Also, this is listed as a course for beginners but it’s not. There should be a prerequisite that the students know some of the software used. I feel very sorry for the true beginners that might have taken this course and were not even familiar with the design software. The last really awful part of the course is the peer review for the assignments. How can you really learn from people that are just learning themselves? Regardless of the fact that I did well in the course, not being reviewed at least in part by an instructor, or assistant instructor or someone that already has the knowledge seems absurd.My suggestion is to learn elsewhere like from Udemy, if you want to do the actual design part, as you need to know some of the UI/UX software.

Expect to be given one word/phrase reviews majority of the time, so a lot of self-reflection is needed to really improve.
