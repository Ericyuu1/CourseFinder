36594167~COURSE!~F4VNjX8-EeWBvwrKtFGfAw,1623542083569,4,0," It was worth the time. For anyone trying to understand the whole structure of how to start and organize a social enterprise to have a positive impact on society - this course provides a very good starting point!Pros: the logical flow of the whole course is amazing. You will hardly progress in the course with the feeling that ""something is missing"" because everything was designed by skillful and experienced professors. If you want quality, you will find it here.Cons: Too much texts. Slide after slide of concepts and methods and strategies being introduced thru group/subgroup - in the 4th week you may find yourself losing attention a little too easy, because everything seems the same. This is the only thing I would like the course to improve: a more vivid way to convey the data.But this course was super worthwhile! Loved the professors and their professionalism.

The examples are easy to understand and very practical, including the structure and presentation of Dr. Ian MacMillan and Dr. James Thompson. I finished the course in 1 week because Im doing it full time, but for others who would be doing this for a span of weeks part-time, the lack of integration of all the tables and charts and processes might prove to be difficult and might get lost along the way of memorizing/understanding. I would suggest that the last lecture to have a brief consolidation of all the key takeaways and important tables and charts. Thank you very much.   ",0,0,Gizella Marie A. Herrera,3848981
