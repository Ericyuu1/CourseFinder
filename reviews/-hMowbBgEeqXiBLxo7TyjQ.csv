33077957~COURSE!~-hMowbBgEeqXiBLxo7TyjQ,1630444632279,3,0,"It is good, but there are places it could be better.   The good: - The overview of the types of interview questions that PM will get in an interview - The practice on the Behavioral Questions -The mock practice interviews with Bob and Jenny -The interview with Sandy Clark Where it could be better: - In week 1 there is a mention of an app/website to practice interview questions, but there is no link to it and no access to it on the AWIT website.  Recommendation would be to partner with another site that already does it like PM Exercises and like maybe AWIT members can get an upgraded membership to the PM Interview questions for a period of time. -The frameworks for Product Design and Strategy were hard to follow.  I found using frameworks found on YouTube and other sites to be more helpful. -The assignments in week 3 could be stronger.  Being able to practice interview questions is really important.  Maybe instead of trying to find someone else taking the course to do a 45 min interview with, have learners submit a flipgrid video answering 3-4 questions and a rubric for review. I am still glad I took the course and am excited to get an interview and use the materials covered.  ",0,0,Erin Erickson,33077957

Pretty sure not having an answer is not appropriate for an interview, perhaps, maybe, my suggestion would be to comment on how to manage that situation where you are unable to come with an answer or possibly edit it.

The webinar and Sandy carter's talk did open up a lot of perspectives. Again , my sincere thanks to Nancy Wang and Team for putting this together for learners like me. Enjoyed the whole journey through this specialisation , now challenge is on me for how I am going to use to improve my every day work and career path. If I can change one thing , I would have liked access to this video and materials even post course completion  for easy reference. Another issue , I am facing and per the discussion forum many like me are facing is the time it takes to get an assignment reviewed in uncertain and the fear of that impacting the subscription expiry time costing us an additional month is more. right now I have completed everything but waiting for grading while my subscription expires tomorrow and the support team is no easy to access ",0,0,Lavanya Yuvaraj,68879706

77890648~COURSE!~-hMowbBgEeqXiBLxo7TyjQ,1611937410252,5,0,"I got Product Management certification by finishing Real-World Product Management
Specialization that was prepared and
lead by Nancy Wang, a Head of Product at Amazon (AWS), who also was a Product
Manager at Google and is a CEO and Founder of Advancing Women in Product
(AWIP). Nancy shares her knowledge gained throughout her career in those extremely
successful companies.The specialization is a combo of 4 courses to learn product
management from different perspectives: customer obsession, market sizing,
competitive analyses, success metrics (like KPIs, OKRs, North Stars, A/B/n
tests, NPS, CSAT, CES, cohort analyses, LTV, pricing, and financials), etc.The big advantage of this course is it helps you to create your
own portfolio through studying all 4 courses by developing your own product
using real-life PM tasks during product management lifecycle from inception
till launch. Each task takes about an hour. This work is peer-reviewed and you
get real feedback. Even though it is quite time-consuming to do those practical
assignments and peer review assignments of other students, it helps to get
practical knowledge and learn things by doing, which is especially extremely
important for folks who want a transition to a PM role and have no real
experience yet. Another advantage is that you get trained using real PM
interview questions. Nancy shares questions from giants like Amazon, Google,
Facebook, and Microsoft and helps to master their Behavioral, Product Design,
Strategy, Estimation, and Technical interview questions.Also, it was super useful to listen to interviews and panels
that Nancy did with successful senior Product Managers and Leaders in Product
where they shared their experience, insights, and tips for PM career, things
they are looking for in PM candidates. On top of that Nancy shares great sources for networking to
advance your career as a Product Manager.I highly recommend every Product Manager to take this up!!Thank you to Nancy Wang and the rest of #AWIP for putting this course together!I learned so much that I am excited to take into my current and
future roles.",0,0,Vera Trubacheva,77890648
