The video's of the exercises went rather fast and speech was not following the movements, which made it difficult to follow.

On top of that, the questions in the quizzes are often unrelated or based on unknown content (not mentioned during the course). This been said, I did learn something and enjoyed the course",0,0,Delphine Gauthier-Georgakopoulos,55132341
3547783~COURSE!~GJh7EPlPEeqxbQpDcjDTVQ,1645673588076,3,0,"I​ found this course to be very intersting and quite comprehensive. I liked the demonstration of various traditional exercises. I think the course designers should have hired native English speakers to voice over the Chinese teachers as some of them are hard to understand. The quizzes did not seem to be entirely related to the video lessons. Some questions popped out of the blue, like: what is the international yoga day. Or is weight lifting aerobics. I don't think it is, but it seems the teachers disagree. I don't think the breathing exercise was demonstrated clearly.... But the course has demonstrated the importance of physical exercise and meditation in building up the immunity. ",0,0,Zlatica S Hoke,3547783

Some questions in the quizzes are not related to the scripts presented by the instructors.  Still,  I will recommend the course to friends.",0,3,Giovanni W Antonietta,9384934

19936740~COURSE!~GJh7EPlPEeqxbQpDcjDTVQ,1626062899323,5,0,"Thank you for the valuable and informative contents. Well done. Just a suggestions: at the practical parts, please show the easier option for those with illness and disease as well as pregnancy options. I'm a Medical Dr and a fitness instructor teaching Yoga, Tai Chi and Pilates in gyms. We always show the easier options, the advanced option and the pregnancy options. For example at the Sun salutation part, we don't always jump back from forward fold to down dog. we slowly step back 1 leg at a time. This option is safe for less athletic people and the pregnant ladies. Another option is bending knees at poses transition from 1 pose to next pose. It is safer. So, my suggestion is to add on precautions and EASY/ADVANCED/PREGNANCY OPTIONS. Hope to see Part 2 of this course, perhaps covering Tai Chi (Shaolin or Wudang styles). Thank you and take care.
