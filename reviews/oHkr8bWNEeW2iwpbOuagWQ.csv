9180045~COURSE!~oHkr8bWNEeW2iwpbOuagWQ,1482221032171,1,0,This course gives good perspective on innovation process and how to bring idea to life. However it was disappointing to me that content of the course has nothing to do with Art and Culture.,0,2,Irina Koksharova,9180045

42269905~COURSE!~oHkr8bWNEeW2iwpbOuagWQ,1595596931497,3,0,"I expected this course to be much more art and culture oriented. It felt like your normal course in business innovation, which had some ""add-ons"" here and there on how the information could be transferred to arts and culture. In this sense, it isn't really driven in its core from actual arts and cultural industries, and I find that these industries and circumstances are very different from the business world. As an innovation course in the business environment, I would find it useful though. In addition, some of the reading materials were not available any more on their original websites. I couldn't find a way to easily contact the content providers. ",0,1,S.D,42269905

However, I came across a few broken links for various required and extra readings. I posted about these broken links on the course forums, but no changes seem to have been made, nor was there any recognition of my postings.",0,1,Tanya Day,53403395
10426314~COURSE!~oHkr8bWNEeW2iwpbOuagWQ,1482411424293,4,0,"Content is great and would highly recommend The structure for grading however is poor. The peer assignments don't work well compared to other Coursera courses. I submitted my assignments in time, but even after a month I still don't have one peer that has completed my review which then delays the 'completion' of my course. When I go to do other peer reviews for other people on the same assignment I am presented with 6 month old assignments overdue from previous courses?! In addition, you can't participate in the forum discussions until you submit something yourself. I would prefer to add to a thread than go in blind to each forum",0,1,Francine Stevens,10426314
