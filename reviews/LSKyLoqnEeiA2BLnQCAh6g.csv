F​or all the cognitive and learning styles presented, the course is more a constant lecturing, in many cases without a break, an example or dynamic to it.T​he Required Reading material, while good, takes several hours to get through — I spent at least 20 hours reading external content marked as Required Reading, with little to no direction.R​egarding the assessments, they are VERY difficult to complete, as there is a lot of questions of the type ""Select all that apply"" and, in some cases, those are not part of the content, but deductive questions, leading to a lot of trial and error, and failed attempts.E​ven taking notes during the course (downloading all the transcripts and required reading material), finding the right answer among 150+ pages of content is a demanding feat.
On this note, the course advises we can download the slides, which I was not able to find; and downloading the transcript of the lectures to study from gives you a plain text document that quickly becomes useless due to the lack of formatting it provides.
It'd be a welcome addition if the university prepared the transcript as a formatted document, so it can be used for study/assessment purposes.Overall, I learned a few things, but I wouldn't recommend this course unless you want some overall ID concepts.",0,1,Jose Damiani,113909916

43867848~COURSE!~LSKyLoqnEeiA2BLnQCAh6g,1565975060940,1,0,"My opinion is influenced by my professional experience as a classroom teacher, that utilizes the Flip model and other non-traditional instructional practices.  In teacher professional development we talk a lot about “best practices” and how best to reach our students, and this class just fails miserably in achieving “best practices”. As a teacher, I’m not completely ignorant when it comes to the content of this course.  Weeks 3 and 4 covered content I am familiar with and/or have received specialized training concerning those topics.  Weeks 1 and 2 were largely new information and really just provided me with vocabulary and structured thinking to many things that I do already.  Returning to “best practices”, the entire course simply fails to demonstrate the concepts it is teaching.  Using Gagne’s Nine Events of Instruction, the instructors have failed to gain the attention of their audience, and they fail to recognize the impact of their presentation style on the attitudes – specifically motivation and engagement – of the audience.    I would like to share a few recommendations with you.  First, the instructional video format.  A rule with instructional videos is that you can expect about 1 minute of attention for every grade level.  So for a 9th grader, don’t make your videos longer than about 9 minutes.  There is a point of diminishing returns.  Keep your videos short.  A thirty-minute instructional video is a bad idea in general.  Break the video into multiple parts to make it “digestible”, and not overload the learner.  The “talking heads” format that is utilized is not engaging.  The slides have too much text; if the learner has to read the slides, then they aren’t listening to you.  None of the presenters are engaging in personality or delivery.  Dr. Huang may be an expert in this field, but his videos are long, his voice is monotone, and he just doesn’t have a presence on screen.  Nothing about any of the presenters’ deliveries makes learning in this course exciting.    Required reading in this course needs to be altered.  I could have purchased a book on Amazon for $20 that covered the same content in fewer pages and would focus more on practicality than straight up theory.  The week 3 required reading was “unreadable”.  You could get the same result of your required readings by just giving students a bullet list of topics and having them do their own Google Search of terms.  That would at least be active learning.    Assessment design in this course is poor.  The discussion prompts in videos are a waste of time as every student creates their own thread in the discussion forum and there is no incentive to dig through responses to get other people’s opinions or views because it is not referenced directly in the summative assessments.  Question design in the quizzes should be changed as well.  Multiple choice questions are one thing, but multiple choice-multiple answer questions are cruel.  The later quizzes are extremely difficult because of this as phrasing and structuring of answers is not referenced directly from the videos.  This requires content fluency from the learner that has not been practiced, developed or assessed prior to this quiz, so the learner is left guessing and hoping.  Thankfully, there are essentially unlimited retakes.    THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT.  At the beginning of the course it is stated that this course is part of the MicroMasters program.  According to the course listing for that program on CoursEra….it’s not.    I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND using a couple of case studies that are introduced at the beginning of the course and are examined throughout the course as topics and methods are discussed.  Draw parallels; point out possible errors; DEMONSTRATE what you are talking about.    As a teacher, I always strive for student engagement.  This is even discussed during the course, attitude/motivation has a big influence on the success of the learning experience.  Make the course more engaging.  Right now I don’t plan to continue the MicroMasters program because the experience thus far has been a soul-sucking/motivation-draining experience AND I’m not convinced the instructors can provide me with any information, methods, etc., that I’m not already familiar with that will improve my skills in the development, implementation, and evaluation of my learning resources.

These checklist responses are incredibly narrowly drawn. Achieving a passing score on a quiz may take up to 8 tries and winds up feeling like a cram school. It is also clear that the course owner does not attend much to feedback in the forums; one problem noted by a student 5 months ago (duplication of video content in one module) was still not addressed when I took the course.

I will use question two as an example; “Learning goals should…(Please check all that apply): 1) Focus on the big picture of knowledge gain, skill development and ability/attitude change, 2) Address a performance/learning problem directly, 3) Describe the problem and gap broadly so it can be flexible depending on strategy and the types of learning environment, 4) Describe what the learners will be able to do after instruction.”  The detailed notes and my previous training background gave a level of confidence I would be able to answer correctly. I chose the first two responses: “Focus on the big picture of knowledge gain, skill development and ability/attitude change” and “address a performance/learning problem directly.”  These two answers were clearly defined in part one video of week four. However, the question was marked wrong! I began to work all the options of answers to get the question correct and for fourteen tries I was still wrong. I did not ever select the last of the four answers since I knew that answer referred to learning objectives and not learning goals. In week four, part three beginning at the twentieth sentence of the video lecture, Professor states, “Learning objectives are the statements describing what learners will be able to do after the instruction.” However, the only way for me to receive a correct answer for this question was to include the fourth answer which is CLEARLY WRONG!! It is not part of the definition of learning goals as outlined in the course. SO FRUSTRATING. Not only would I continue taking the quiz every eight hours for the rest of my life, there is no way to resolve such an issue or opportunity to debate. Part of instructional design is to understand the end user experience and it would do the staff good to see things from the student perspective. My constructive criticism of the course continues with:1.       The above mentioned issue with quizzes having incorrect content, specifically week 4, question 2. 2.       The quiz feedback is inaccurate and inadequate. 3.       No resolution or ability to resolve questions of content. My effort to highlight this issue in the discussion help form went to never-never land.4.       Only peer feedback and no instruction participation. I had a peer review that accused me of plagiarism with no proof or specific feedback. She simply stated it looked like “it was copy and paste.” Absolutely false and infuriating. The course relies too heavily on peer feedback. There should be other forms of feedback.5.       The course does not complete the ADDIE design model. There could have been one module to summarize the remaining parts of the model after Analysis.",0,1,Doug Bunting,44494620

Assessments:a) Quizzes - different numbers of questions in each quiz and time sensitiveness in some quizzes bring chaos in the learning process; students have to guess their instructors' exact thoughts - the Week 4 quiz is especially poorly designed. Suggestions: have the same number of questions for each quiz throughout the course; time all or do not do it at all; make the answers clear and easily derivable from course resources. b) Written Assignments - grading through peer reviews is a nightmare, heavily based on a subjective point of view. Suggestions: remove the grading portion from peer reviews and leave only the feedback comments required.Demand Hours:a) Weekly demand hours are unbalanced - one week is heavier than another which is not helpful for students to plan their learning time.b) Reading rates are ridiculous: 10 minutes are given to read 12 pages of scholarly reading while in reality, it can take about an hour (undergrad - 11 pp/hour, grad - 13pp/hour)Suggestions: Balance weekly demand hours and put in feasible reading rates. I work as an Instructional Designer in a University, and if this course is well-designed, I would consider taking the suggested MasterTrack. But since this course was designed so poorly, it became an anti-advertisement for me about the University, which offered it, and Coursera platform as a whole.

However, the way the course was instructed did not meet my expectations.Firstly, content is recited over the videos, this means, students are to sit watching a video of an instructor that talks about complex subjects in a monochrome tone of voice, with the exception of 2-3 speakers. Reciting a content leaves no room for the audience to interpret the subjects, but to learn by heart what was said leading to no motivation from the audience. Secondly, this way of ""teaching"" made quizzes extremely, not to mention unnecessarily, complex for the answers needed to be a copy/paste from the lessons, changing one word could lead to an incorrect answer. Thirdly, why not providing the right answers after succeeding a test, how are we supposed to know the right answers of those questions we did not get right?. Not to talk about the various technical issues, like running out of quiz attempts after using only 2 chances making you hand in the assignments late, marking right answers wrong even when you had a screen shot of the exact words from the video lessons, finding out that your first answers were correct after 8 attempts. Not being able to interact with the instructors when in doubt or in need of clarification.Overall, sadly, I did not have a good experience doing this course; therefore, I would not recommend.

No idea how long ago it went live, but there are some problems. First, the GOOD: content and concepts covered are excellent, it's a solid overview of ID. Clear distinctions could have been drawn between how ID is used in educational institutiions and the corporate world, but perhaps a foundational course didn't need to do that. The resources screen at the end of each video lecture was a valuable resource. I was motivated to finish the course because I recognized the value of the content. Now, the PROBLEMS: I am surprised that a course in ID seems to do many of the things that other teaching courses would caution against. The lecture videos were uniformly talking heads or Powerpoint slides or basic graphics and charts on a uniform background. Often, the font in the graphics was small and difficult to read. The slides were little more than outlines of the topics. There were frequent jump cuts and topic changes within the lectures that could be a little jarring. There were virtually no other interactive aspects to content delivery in the modules. And the most difficult aspect to speak about was the delivery of the content verbally. It's not clear at the top that there will be different instructors--Dr. Hoa may be an excellent teacher and expert in this area, but the flatness of his affect and delivery is problematic in this context. English is not his native language, and though he is just fine with the content, listening and engaging in this format was not easy. Peer reviews of assignment are common in Coursera, and this course was no exception. But these are long assignments (especially the Module 3 case), and having only one peer review determine a pass or fail is problematic. I am not convinced that many peer reviewers understand the scoring system. You submit an assignment, and wait for other assignments to show up for peer review. That can take awhile. When an assignment does appear, only then do you see the scoring rubric by which your own assignment will be graded. It's not clear when scoring an assignment whether you are passing or failing it, unless you simply choose the highest score for every item. In other words, you don't know where the goalposts are until you've already kicked the ball. This seems a basic error in assessment design. FINALLY, the Module 4 quiz was an exercise in frustration, with poor design for questions. I had to retake the quiz six times, and actually run a process of elimination as I tried to come up with the correct combination of answers for two questions in particular. One question (about Gagne's first rule for teaching) was consistently marked wrong, even though I am confident that error was in the test bank. (I took the answer directly from the lectures, and checked online as well.)  Other students reported similar problems in the discussion area. More questions would buffer against questions with design problems. And finally, the bloody text editor for submissions is clunky--sometimes it will jump you back to the top of the screen as you navigate, sometimes the formatting bar simply disappears, and some hyperlinks may or may not be inserted. For the longer Module 3 assignment, I sketched an outline with formatting for organization with nothing fancy but spacing. I saved drafts, previewed it, and all looked good. Yet after submitting, the spacing disappeared, and what was left was a heap of text with no paragraphs or spaces. WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) is not a heavy lift for text editors! This aspect of the Coursera platform really needs an upgrade.I​ only took time to write this down because, at bottom, I really appreciated the opportunity to have this material available. But really, and ID course should model what good ID looks like, both from content and from technology. ",0,2,Gerald Seminatore,37775171

I especially appreciated the pre-readings because they were so in depth and well written.The videos didn't go into major depth but I think that was because, just like most in-person university classes, you are supposed to go into them having gained some prior knowledge through the pre-readings.  It was a little fast sometimes but I would just pause and rewind the video.I have also seen a few reviews that said the course should be taught by ""native english speakers"" and those people will be very limited in their instructional design scope if they are only focused on ""native english speakers.""  Go and rewatch the Diversity & Inclusion video in module 3.  Also, to the lady who said in her review that the women's voices were ""shrill"":  these women actually have pleasant tones to their voices and are usually lower-pitched than most women I talk to (myself included).Anyways, if you are brand-spanking new to Instructional Design, I would HIGHLY recommend this course.
