When you do it again, you will find that the question has been changed, and the scoring rule for multiple-choice questions is that there is no score for fewer selections. Why set up such a rule? Why do I get no score for fewer selections? You think that this will make students listen to the class more seriously, but it is precisely because of this test grading format that makes the rejuvenating course also disgusting to students.

I completed the Intro to Accounting course and decided that I wanted to learn more about this fascinating subject. Boy, Am I glad I did it. Thanks to the professor who sprinkles the videos with occasional light-hearted moments which I personally feel gives some breathing space and moments of relaxation and smiles amidst hardcore serious subject concepts.The follow up course is definitely a step up from the introductory course and I did not expect anything less. My scores do not match my scores in the introductory course but I think it is partly because the concepts are slightly more in depth and the length of the course itself is longer. There are 6 weeks of classes before you take up the final exam. Overall this is one of the more in-depth classes that I have taken in Coursera.
