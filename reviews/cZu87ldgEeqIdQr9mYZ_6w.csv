42238025~COURSE!~cZu87ldgEeqIdQr9mYZ_6w,1624253045499,1,0,"Course is called ""Agile Organization"", but it has nothing to do with agile organization (except a 3 1/2 minute video at the very end). It's a mere overview of the some basic change management techniques. Which I enjoyed, but it's not what it was supposed to be. Instructor seems to be nice, but to feel uncomfortable in front of the camera, too. She reads her text. And at every other sentence,  she makes a break, followed by this weird smirk. Hard to watch.",0,0,Philipp Husi,42238025

35970477~COURSE!~cZu87ldgEeqIdQr9mYZ_6w,1645043208490,4,0,"V​ery good course with helpful case studies. Improvement suggestions:-​ Case studies: There's one broken link in the case studies. I'd also appreciate all case studies would be not just curated but prepared and presented in a comparative way: when, how did they start with their agile transformation? what did they then to mature as an agile organisation? what's different or specific compared to the other cases. Also, presented case studies vary a lot in terms of depth and format-​ UX of the slides/video: Please stop putting all text in caps. This makes it harder to read which is accentuated by the alignment to the right.-​ I don't think that many change management theories are needed actually. ",0,0,Patricia Stone,35970477
