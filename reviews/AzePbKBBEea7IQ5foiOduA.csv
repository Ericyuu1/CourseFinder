The methods used for the planning of the course is accurate and all the videos, resource materials referred, and the testing or reviewing assignments are up to mark. The only recommendations and suggestions are as follows:(i)  Certificate needs to be complemented with mark sheets/ consolidated mark sheet/memo.(ii) The certificate is non-credited certificate; therefore, some the employers may hesitate to accept it whether applier is holding no other certificates. (iii) The videos are not downloadable so it will be difficult to watch with no or low internet connection areas. (iv) The course can be finished less than a month but the course knowledge is worth for more than six months syllabus then the certificate may be written as one year learning course. (v) The course could be added preparation of financial budgets and writing business plans.  ",0,2,Mawliid Kayse Mohumed,79422836
