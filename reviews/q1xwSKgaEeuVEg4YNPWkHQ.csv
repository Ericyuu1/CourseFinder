1889678~COURSE!~q1xwSKgaEeuVEg4YNPWkHQ,1669605624184,5,0,I have recently acquired Polish citizenship by establishing my right of descent through my Polish father although I was born  and live in Australia and am an Australian citizen.  My mother was German and so EU Citizenship reinforces  and validates my European identity.  I am grateful for the EU and the opportunities and rights I have as an EU citizen. One of the questions I'm curious about is  - as an EU citizen but not an EU resident -do I have any rights to vote in EU elections?  I found this to be a useful civics primer for those who are or who are planning to be EU citizens. ,0,0,Steven Wlazly,1889678
