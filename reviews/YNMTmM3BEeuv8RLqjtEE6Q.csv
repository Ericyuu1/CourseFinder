You can submit your project a week early, and still be listed as ""Overdue"" because your assignment hasn't been graded yet.

Expect to cancel your Specialization Subscription while you wait for the grading to eventually get around to you.",0,0,Travis Drake Albers,111753667

One depends on the qualification of the companions, which is not quick or guaranteed. And the instructor's signature does not appear on the certificate.",0,0,Yngrid Coronado,17100507
24785168~COURSE!~YNMTmM3BEeuv8RLqjtEE6Q,1656409643281,2,0,"When I started this course, I started it with the idea that I already had some theoretical knowledge of linear regression, and that was I think one of the reasons I passed this course, rather than the course itself.  The lectures and the requirements were not compatible most of the time, where the requirements were on a much higher level than the lectures we were given to read and practice. The lectures in this course and the given material were also incompatible - somewhere the reading material was too general, where for instance the matrices parts were too hard and without proper explanation. Also, the Lab part with the R studio.... Without any explanation and tutorial, we were given the console and expected to ""run"" and perform the given tasks. This was the place where I came without previous knowledge of R, so a small link to a tutorial or something similar (like explanation what exactly to do)  would be much helpful.
