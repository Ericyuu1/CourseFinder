The instructions are unclear regardeding what they want you to do. My code is 100% correct. I know this because I am running it in RStudio on my pc and comparing results to what they want. It is the user interface that sucks. What a waste of time. Another strike against Coursera. T​he ONLY Coursera class I have found to be high quality is Python for Everybody with Dr. Charles Severance.",0,0,Thomas Hulslander,97775814
