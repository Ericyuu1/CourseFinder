I guess I feel like I would of learned more if it hadn't been so simplified.  That said, if you have no background in Android App development you may have to spend a fair amount of time learning Android on you're own in order to to the exercises.The final project involved writing an app to connect to an ""Elastic Search"" server using REST protocol. I could not get this to work, I think the server was down. I ended up turning my assignment in untested (I have has similar issues in other Coursera classes).What I thought was missing in the class was an overview of some of the more advanced Java idioms used in some of the code (builders, Parameterized Classes, etc.).  This may have been an attempt to stay relatively language neutral.So overall good, but I might have liked1) More on advanced Java;2) Less hand-holding on exercises - I understand some students may have minimal Android experience, so maybe provide two versions of the exercise, with and without ""starter code"";3) please be cognizant of keeping the Elastic Search Server running, If it is required by the assignments (I understand there is also a way to run Elastic Search locally, although I didn't try it)                        Thank You,                           David Tucker ",0,0,David Tucker,11086874
