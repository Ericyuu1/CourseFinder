One of the first few weeks also involve extracting data using SQL, so this was new experience. My overall opinion is that this course really spoon-feed quite a bit, so that during the peer review you can see almost everyone comes with almost identical proposal. As of now it seems there is still a healthy number of students who take this module (which is really important for any peer-reviewed course).

The instructors do a great job of taking you through a real data analytics project from start to finish, closely mimicking a real business scenario. I found the assignments to be challenging, requiring class-mates to work together and collaborate on the discussion boards. I feel very prepared for a data analytics position after completing this specialization. I'm giving 5 stars, but it is rounded up from 4.5 The reason for that is because I feel like there should be more room for creativity in the capstone project. The instructors do allow for the students to come up with their own analysis however, there are many required components of the final project which leave little room for creativity.",0,2,Alexander K Beck,29509506
