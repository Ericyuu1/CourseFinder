130607~COURSE!~IKyL5K93Eeusrg6wKBIcAw,1677492555368,4,0,"This course is not easy, all tasks are challenging. I got a lot of new information. 

Things I personally don't like in this course. 
1. For each task it's needed to set up individual GitHub runner.
2. Each task has dependencies on another task with submodules. As a result,  it's imposible to do tasks out of order. 
3. Documentation on how to setup the repository correctly is not straightforward.
4. It's impossible to debug tasks like typical applications, as a task is only a part of the large and complicated test system.",0,0,Vasyl Yosypenko,130607
