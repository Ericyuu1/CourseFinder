For example: no one in their right mind would pay another firm (baltimore) 300$, that comes out with a profit of more than 100$ just due to a lucky break, when the other firm should have payed 200$ in the first place, and doensn't take into affect that the sheer effort of oranizing the flights, schedueles and negotiations, is not worth the 300$ saved by San fransisco along with the feeling of getting ""screwed"" (a feeling that even monkeys fight against).

As someone who had no formal theoretical knowledge on, or exposure to, this topic I feel I have been equipped with a whole new skill set!The only drawback is the peer-reviewed assignment approach. I felt that the amount of effort put into preparing negotiation videos and-or written assignments, is not taken seriously by peers that assigned to do the assessments. This may be due to the fact that most participants in this course do not pay for this course. The feedback is rushed and superficial.

This meant I needed to complete the course in certain amount of time, and my pace was two weeks material per one week.  This worked great until mastery quizz, which only allows another try every 8 hours.  I had been unprepared for the math involved in the course.  So I couldn't quite recreate the mathematical steps in my head during tests though it seemed clear when professor did it.  I had somehow thought that the course would be about how to psychologically /emotionally encourage people to take positive and productive part in a negotiation process.  I didn't know it would be primarily around how to encourage people to accept your thinking based purely on numbers.  Maybe that can be made a little more clear in the course description prior to enrolling?I also struggled with finding a partner for the peer assignments, due to people not responding, even though I did not leave it till last minute and went straight in during week 1.  So this made me worried about finding a partner for the two later assignments.I ended up listening to all the lectures, but unenrolled as administrative requirement to backtracking the certificate I had paid for up front, in order to get that certificate attached to another course (Psychological First Aid = though professor not as charismatic, and did not have any groovy graphics like this one, the material was interesting and I sailed right through to get the certificate without issues).So:  the content was interesting and very worthwhile overall (= 4 stars), but it did not provide for my primary purpose (= 3).

Of course this is probably not the course for someone whose job is to negotiate as its daily task (and even for those, it might be helpful), but it definitely provides some insights that every person should have as a citizen. This will give you tips to benefit you in future negotiations, but most of all, it will teach you to be fair, honest and win a negotiation in a healthy way. The math of it might be considering advanced for some, but I don't think you have to understand all the formulas and equations behind it, if you can get a general sense of what is being taught. I definitely reccomend this course to have it on your CV, and to give you some tips on how to confront possible future situations of your life like negotiating a house, or a better salary. All the people that contribute to this course are expert in the matters and it's great to hear from them. In addition, this course is super interactive, easy to follow, and it promotes ""learning by doing"", by connecting you to other people, all over the world, who are also taking this course, for simulations of real negotiations, which allows you to practice what you learned in a chill environment, where there's nothing but tremendous learning opportunities.

The animations are visually cute, but they are also so rich in ideas that the transcripts essentially form a good set of notes about the topic, and they are infused with Barry's sense of fun. My only complaints are that the last couple of weeks of interviews with negotiators aren't as rich/interesting as the first part of the course (though Cohen was great), the early examples are perhaps overly numeric (though probably justifiably for simplicity), and from peer assessments it seemed that many students had little understanding of probability/expected value.

3417952~COURSE!~tGbJuel4EeSnMSIACzuFJw,1442990952997,5,0,"I found this course very helpful and would recommend this course for anyone who wants to improve their negotiation skills. The course uses animation to elaborate complex concepts and assignments for practices. Not like other negotiation skills teaching the tips for negotiation, the thinking logic and principle of the course is highly useful. Besides, there are many recorded role plays for us to see what others do and what we can learn from others.  So far this is the best course I've taken at Coursera Platform! I do think Coursera should make some billboard for course recommendations based on students comments. ",0,0,yvonneluyifan,3417952

It is still under construction)After I had to change my proficiency, from being a truck driver  to a total different job type by doing sales on telephone, my new boss (new and different company) urged me. She urged me, to invest in my private time learning how to make money on the phone. Instead of irritating potential customers by doing weird offers. After a good while of understanding, why is the other side willing to invest in products, my wage is remarkably higher. By compare of some weeks before. I understand also, to invest in ideas which are worth to pay for. And I started with one bought book to learn ""Game Theory 101: The Complete Textbook"". The other two books are introduced by Prof. Barry Nielbuff. Yes, my QUIZZ-answers are WRONG. Nevertheless I learn what is going on. And that helps me doing a much better job. With great fun. Just want to say ......   Thank you all. ",0,0,Dalibor Krajc,6700176
