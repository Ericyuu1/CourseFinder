50385034~COURSE!~iA2DtsfyEeinmg4faAQDzg,1663024998475,1,0,"T​his course is very different than other courses that you took on coursera! I had issues with peer-graded assignments in this course. We were supposed to upload a pdf file of our work and grade at least 3 assignments. I uploaded my HW and graded 14 assignments and almost all of them were either cheating (uploaded another person's HW) or uploaded a file that was not related to the assignment at all. It looks like most of these people are just scamming Coursera! I waited for a week to get my HW graded and I finally received a grade! Fail! While one grader went through the ruberic and graded my work based on that, there was another person who simply gave me zero on all sections!!! The first question was simply ""Did the learner upload a PDF report? "" That person gave me zero even on this part!
It looks like these people do not want to spend some time grading your work. They just want to open and close 3 people's work to pass the ""Review your peers"" section! And they simply put zero on everything!
Coursera's solution to this problem is really funny! Submit it again! ",0,3,fatemeh kazemiparkouhi,50385034
101310120~COURSE!~iA2DtsfyEeinmg4faAQDzg,1648060518673,3,0,"The content of the course was good and provided a introduction to concepts in healthcare data analytics. I had expected more focus on concepts related to data modeling and software used in analytics processes, but maybe these topics are addressed in later courses in the series. This is less a criticism of the course itself and more of the Coursera approach in general, but I did not like the peer-reviewed assignments. I didn't mind doing the assignments themselves. I found the assignments somewhat interesting, but I didn't like the fact that obtaining a final grade was dependent on receiving feedback from other learners and waiting for others to submit their reviews. I prefer a course where I can complete the work entirely on my own time. I very much disliked having to log back in day after day to see if anyone had submitted an assignment that I could grade.",0,4,Ann D. Bagchi,101310120

I appreciated the small quizzes in-between the larger end-of-week quiz to make sure that we're on track! Only one comment on peer-review process: I  submitted my report on time but I had to extend my deadline since the reviewer gave me feedback more than a  week later.
