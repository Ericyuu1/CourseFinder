49016267~COURSE!~eGjoytoJEeWyqBL0ju_dbQ,1594395132999,4,0,"It is an essential course for anyone who wants to have a global view on water supply and treatment. I really enjoyed the interview with Professor Allan's. I can't help saying that I preferred the course 1 ""Water Supply and Sanitation Policy in Developing Countries Part 1: Understanding Complex Problems"". In this part 2 the solutions that are given to solve the problems are more abstract than concrete. In a way, the course from week 1 to 7 suggests that the waters must be privatized. I didn't like the ""black cat and white cat"" analogy. I did not like the fact that you invited an economist who said that it is not necessary to be an expertise in waters to regulate waters. (but it turned out to be necessary information to understand the world we live in). Honestly, throughout week 7 of the course I thought I was going to make a very average assessment of the course. In the end, the brilliant interview with Professor Allan's made me change my mind and I think the 4/5 score is more than deserved. In general I liked the course and I think you should continue to do this work. (Don't be upset about my honesty, but I needed to be honest). In an upcoming edition I suggest that you try to find ways to improve public utilities.",0,1,Pedro Martins,49016267

First thing the European model of privatization suggest that State government is shedding responsibilities towards the fundamental needs of the citizens of their countries and by large making every think privatization.  This not replicable model  all over the World - what the current course is propagating to do so.  As per the ?united Nation Fundamental rights and even for each countries, the State is responsible for the basic needs of their citizen. So WB or ADB or else international agencies should also look on these major aspects and try to provide the desired service under the fedral law of the country by the country's governing  government.I think the Part one was much better than Part II",0,1,Dr Harshit Sinha,24839382
