117468526~COURSE!~_ZpZKyTxEemb-BL8g3X_rg,1670478588600,1,0,It was the worst experience I have ever had.  It is just pain with no gain. The instructor was too young. The lectures were not explaining anything that was included in the labs. The course learning objectives were entirely different from the course itself. The course requires expertise in python that is not written anywhere. The lectures and Labs are in different dimensions.  Everything that you want to learn will be in assignments that will not be taught in course lectures. It means that all the burden will be on your shoulders. Lecture videos are just about the intro and expect everything as an expert to be done in the assignments. It seems that it's a blog instead of a taught course. It's better that we go and read the blog related to NLP. Labs are all useless. Some labs are having errors that waste too much time for students. Poor support. ,0,1,khubaib Ahmed,117468526

It wouldn't be a problem if the videos themselves were decent, but most of them are about 1 minute long. You can't explain machine learning in such a short time. 3) The code of the assignments, especially assignment 4, is unclean (e.g. unused variables) and contains minor bugs. 4) The script that grades the assignments has very strict requirements: as an example, very often, if you use x.dot(A) instead of np(x,A), then it complains and says you've failed. This happens for a lot of numpy functions, and it makes the process of submitting results tedious.5) Again, regarding the course material itself, many of the key aspects are not discussed.

Overall, this is the kind of class where the detailed syllabus the most valuable component.  There is good information and topical introductions here, but I think the lecturer has forgotten the feeling of not being 1000% familiar with the material, especially the math.Some notes:1)  Most, if not all topics are glossed over very quickly, especially mathematical ones.  I very much miss Andrew's deeper (and more extensive) ""intuition"" videos here, and I say that as someone with a degree in computer science.2) There are many errors in the lectures and in the labs.  Sometimes a ""popup"" will tell you about them, sometimes not.3) Popup quizzes in the lecture videos happen before the lecturer has even finished speaking about the topic being quizzed and are very jarring.4) The ""practice"" (but still graded) quizzes have a difficulty level way out of proportion to the lecture content, especially those mathematical concepts that are so quickly glossed over.  If you really must spend only 30 seconds on an equation and then expect us to remember/work it off the top of our head in a quiz days later, give us some exercises or some practice at least!5) Labs are mostly just literal steps of ""type this"", ""now type this"".  When it is more demanding, the instructions are not very useful and do not prepare anyone for the quirks of how libraries like numpy work.  In many cases, there is no way to explain or diagnose why my numerical outputs were different from expected, especially when I followed all the instructions.  Having to deep dive into the numpy documentation to find arbitrary arguments based on (seemingly arbitrary) data structure choices of the lab author in order to complete a lab doesn't feel productive or motivating.6) Although a minor nit, the audio inconsistency between talking head and slides is very jarring.

2. Errors are present in the slides and should be corrected in the content as well (especially in week 2 Vclass vs V + incorrect addition of frequencies which made several slides inacurate).
3. Using the term ""dot products"" limits the understanding of the transformations performed in vector space. In my opinion, it would be worthly to speak/ write ""projection"" instead on the slides.4. Make a clear plan within a week that recall the place of each concept into NLP processing.

However, I have some significant reservations about the current state of the course.First, the course is introduced by Andrew Ng as being taught by Younes Bensouda Mourri and Lukasz Kaiser, and heavily promoted by Andrew's marketing through deeplearning.ai and The Batch. In reality, Andrew is barely involved (except for a couple of excellent optional interviews), Lukasz says a sentence or two at the beginning of each lecture, and Younes handles the lectures. Younes is just fine as a teacher, but it is clear he is reading from scripts and one feels as if the course was advertised as being taught by a more senior team. It does not have anything like the feel of authority of Andrew's classic Machine Learning course on Coursera.Second, there are various small errors in the materials. For example, one slide set that has numerous calculations wrong because a column of numbers is summed to 12 rather than 13, and the course has a small notice about the error rather than correcting the slides. There are various confusing instructions (and some small errors) in the programming assignments.Third, some of the choices of content were odd. I did not understand why week 3 spent much of the programming assignment on the details of implementation of PCA (which is a visualization technique not an NLP technique), without really teaching the underlying math.In sum, this is a good introduction to NLP concepts but as yet below the standard that one expects in the Andrew Ng universe.",0,0,Maury Shenk,26144230

So, you end up with a course that is too light on the NLP but assumes anyone doing the assignments knows the little numpy and dictionary tricks that they do. Consequently, the assignments do not test your understanding of NLP, only your understanding of how the notebook creators code. The videos are far too short, a common complaint I can see from other reviews. Additionally, they fell into a common trap that plagues script writing for education. What you absolutely must not do, and is exactly what they do, is just machine gun through the information and terminology when presenting. If you watch good lecturers, they leave time for concepts to settle in and they will reinforce key points by restating them in a different way. They know how to hit the beats because they know how people learn. An information dump, as we have here, is a poor didactic method.The assignments are mostly okay and use notebooks where you have to 'fill in the blanks'. There are some flaws with this, the first being that you have to write the code in the format they want, so alternative methods are marked as wrong. Even more severe is that there are insufficient checks in some of the later notebooks. It is possible to get far into one and obtain the expected results, only to have one cell give the wrong result.

- Euclidean distance, cosine similarity between word vectors to understand relationship between sets of text, and Principal Component Analysis
- Language translation using rotation matrices, k-nearest neighbours and locality sensitive hashing

The course has weekly lecture videos and has a summary reading after almost every video, which was especially helpful when trying to understand the concepts discussed in a video as a whole.

There are also shorter labs to familiarise you with NLP concepts before the weekly graded programming assignment.

Be sure to walk through and understand how the functions in utils_%.py accompanying each lab work. Similarly, walk through the functions in utils_%.py and how unit test cases are prepared in unittest.py accompanying each assignment.

A good part of this course has been that the course team periodically releases new versions of the labs and assignments containing fixes or new approaches. Therefore bugs discovered by users in your assignment 3 months ago could already be fixed by the time you work on your assignment.

48546862~COURSE!~_ZpZKyTxEemb-BL8g3X_rg,1609530079041,4,0,"Having previously completed the Deep Learning Specialization, I came to this course with the intention of completing the whole NLP specialization, rather than because I was especially interested in the content of this first course from that specialization.The Deep Learning Specialization sets a high standard of teaching quality and I have to say I found this course is not quite to the same standard. It's pretty good but not as good. The instructors are very knowledgeable, they make the effort to explain each topic clearly and they do a pretty good job of that.What I felt could be improved is providing context of where each topic fits into the broader picture of both the theory and current practice of NLP. I was often left feeling, why are we spending time on this particular topic? Is this technique used in current practice or is it just of didactic or historical interest? Great teachers always have the broader context in mind and make sure that students see how everything fits into the bigger picture and why it is worth studying.Although techniques were clearly explained, I felt that the underlying concepts were sometimes less well explained. An example is vector representations of words: we were shown the use of vector arithmetic to find analogies, but without much in the way of explanation of how this is possible. To me, this was the wrong way around: it makes more sense to me to first build an understanding of the representations, then introduce the remarkable result that these representations allow finding analogies.In this course, sentences are represented as a ""bag of words"". This is processing natural language in the way a food processor processes food: chopping it up into a word soup. Since one of the most fundamental aspects of language is its structure, this might seem a hopeless approach. However it gives surprisingly good results for some simple tasks such as classifying tweets as having positive or negative sentiment. If you've done course 5 of the Deep Learning Specialization (Sequence Models), this will feel like a step backwards. There's no deep learning in this course. But I signed up for the course knowing that, so I can't criticise it on that basis. I'm taking the view that this course lays the foundations for more advanced and current topics in the subsequent courses in the specialization and I look forward to getting onto those.The labs and assignments generally work smoothly. There are a few inconsistencies and a couple of the hints were a bit misleading but generally OK.

The coding was just using statistical methods to draw linguistic inferences from these vectors.  I find it unfortunate that we didn't have an opportunity to learn how the vectors themselves are made (or did I miss something?), but merely got them out of a can from Google.It took me a while to figure out that the homeworks are graded by an AI, not a TA, and that one can submit the homework assignments numerous times until getting the grade you want.  Given the large number of students enrolled, I can understand that hand grading would not be an option.  It would probably be helpful to explain this to newcomers like me.I liked the way the assignments are structured. the fill-in-the-blanks approach, followed by some sort of numerical unit test to let us know if our solution was correct is good pedagogy (androgogy?).  My only criticism is that sometimes the unit tests are not very sensitive to common coding errors.  But now I know that we always have the option of running our assignment through the autograder for more complete feedback.The autograder is often overly prescriptive.  For example, ""Function 'np.sign or np.heaviside' not found in Code Cell UNQ_C17.""  Python is a rich language and there are many ways to code C17 without using those particular functions.  The goal should be to get students to solve a problem creatively -- not to follow a particular path.I found the week 4 assignment a real bear -- too long (22 completion sections) in comparison with the others.  I'm sure it was difficult for whoever codes the autograder as well.  They need to do some more code checking.  In UNQ__C8 we were asked to use the pre-coded cosine_similarity function.  Initially this was returning the cosine difference, which is quite the opposite.  In the middle of last week, after I and others reported the error, it was corrected but this seems to have created a cascade of other errors.  For example, in cell UNQ_C9, We are toldExpected Output:[[9 9 9] [1 0 5] [2 0 1]] Which is wrong.  A look at the vectors is enough to see that  (2,0,1) is closest to (1,0,1) by cosine similarity.  I believe the autograder makes the same confusion.  I mention this not to criticize our hard-working programmer, who is otherwise doing an excellent job, but so that the errors get fixed ;-) (edited) ",0,1,Robert Stephenson,119857
