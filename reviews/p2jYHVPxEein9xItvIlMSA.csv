The material presented is interesting and well summarized. The negative is that the lectures are extremely short. Worked problems aren´t covered in the lectures or the readings, and insight into the topic seems to have been omitted. (One example: the gear ratio amplifies torque but reduces rotational speed, so that the overall power is constant.) Imagine what they could teach with 15 minutes instead of seven! Further, why aren't the lecture notes included anywhere in the reading. It makes it hard to refer back to them if you have to search a video instead of a powerpoint.The production quality is professional, but given how thin the content often is, I would prefer they wrote on a white board and filmed using a camera phone, yet delivered more content to the current production. Finally, I feel I spent more time learning to install the ""right"" version of python than I did how to control an autonomous vehicle. The reason I mention this is that Python has progressed, but the notes for installation seem to be static. In a regular college course, the course usually improves with the repeating of it, but this course seems frozen in time.",0,1,Joe Serrano,44385682

40241983~COURSE!~p2jYHVPxEein9xItvIlMSA,1559719923973,5,0,Excellent first course in the specialization. It was everything I hoped it would be. Personally I would have appreciated if the videos have been longer and therefore going more into details. Currently they are more of a fast-paced walk-through. But this is compensated by providing reading materials for each of the the videos (some of which are either behind a paywall or the link is broken - so a cleanup would be a good idea). There is one programming assigment in week 4 to get you started and a final project in week 7. Trying to implement the material from the videos in the final project required me to go back to the slides and comprehend the concepts shown - exactly what I think makes a good programming exercise: not just filling in the blanks but really relatively small block of code that you need to develop on your own.  If you ever get stuck the discussion forums should provide you with all the necessary pointers to resolve any issue. After getting the CARLA simulator working it was fascinating to see your code being used to accelerate/steer your car around a given race track.
