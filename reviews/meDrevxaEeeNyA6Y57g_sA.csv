30168034~COURSE!~meDrevxaEeeNyA6Y57g_sA,1551805273465,2,0,"I have learnt quite a few things in this course. However, I will point out that you must be very attentive and not too surprised when you find a mistake, as they are common. I will leave aside the fact that there weren't many classmates around, which prevents you from having meaningful conversations in the forums and feedback on your peer-reviewed assignments, but I believe it is of interest to realize this soon enough as to not have unrealistic expectations. I was especially disappointed with the quality of the quizzes and other assignments: there were many mathematical expressions that weren't formatted correctly which made it very hard to decipher them. Apart from having badly formatted questions (containing spelling mistakes here and there), there are a few instances where even the answers gathered from the grading tools are wrong in some cases and at the very least ambiguous in other cases. I knew most of the material before taking the course and I was unable to achieve a perfect grade, partly due to the fact that there is absolutely no support from the teaching staff and partly due to the grading system used by the university. On the positive side, most of the videos were engaging in my opinion and all the concepts presented are directly useful to any computer scientist. I particularly enjoyed the first half of the course on number bases and modular arithmetic. Depending on your background, you may find the second half of the course somewhat basic, yet still useful. Overall, I would recommend other courses such as CS50 by Harvard University before this one if you are looking for a certificate. Otherwise, you can skip assignments, do not worry too much about the grades and learn important concepts from this course as a great mathematical foundation in computer science.",0,38,Sébastien Lavoie,30168034

Especially if you have little exposure to these mathematical concepts, it is a good introduction, otherwise it is a good recap. However, if it was intended as publicity for UoL online bachelor program in computer science, the message of this  course is: Stay away from it! There is NO moderator or professor support on the Forum. Quizzes contain mistakes and typesetting errors, making challenging if not impossible to attain full score (the last week is a nightmare, since the key part of a question is blank, and you need to score perfectly on the others to pass!). Even if these issues are pointed out in the Forum since months or years, nobody cares to correct them. The professor does not reply to e-mails either, of course.  Finally, there is a honours track option, which is flawed (i.e. no way to get the honours certificate!). After contacting Coursera, the reason is that the instructor by mistake set the track on the 'practice' mode. Several weeks after that he was solicited by Coursera to correct the mistake (he is the only one that can do that) nothing happened and, based on the above record, I dare to predict that nothing will happen in the coming months or years. Concerning the quizzes, the  evaluation and certificate part, the course is abandoned /on autopilot. If you just want to audit, go ahead without worry, but please take all this into consideration, before enrolling for a certificate.
