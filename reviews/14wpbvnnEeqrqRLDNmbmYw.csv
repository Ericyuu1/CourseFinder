82277169~COURSE!~14wpbvnnEeqrqRLDNmbmYw,1622566304860,3,0,"I am not sure how to describe the course. It is definitely NOT for non-math people. Not recommended for those expecting to be taught math. For those with advanced knowledge it maybe a good course to review the subject. The staff almost never answer the forums, and the quizzes almost never show the rubric, so doubts and questions go unanswered. I also don't think certification is meant for resumes either, so, again, I am not sure how to describe it. It is interesting though.",0,1,Bernardo Cavalcanti,82277169

948351~COURSE!~14wpbvnnEeqrqRLDNmbmYw,1631308830792,4,0,"The final module in the precalculus series. This is extremely valuable for those interested in modeling or just starting the field of modeling. All the functions from the first and second module comes up in this course. Thank you for introducing desmos, it looks like a very useful tool for learning and even to quickly test out some modeling. Personally I wrote all the code in python, used statsmodels and matplotlib library to model all the data. Definitely time consuming but a very enriching experience. The sample problems and quizzes are also very useful. I docked one star because I couldn't find the data discussed in the lectures available for download. That would have been very useful. Nevertheless I found my way around these either getting data from the web or just manually copying the data into my python code. Thank you for an excellent series on PreCalculus.

Course discussion is pretty much dead at this point (Jan 2023), and occasionally some of the quizzes later on have no feedback as to why an answer is right or wrong. Besides these issues, I found the course valuable and feel more prepared to take Calculus this semester after a long break from math. ",0,0,Joseph McCann,45018166

Love the small story, such as cosine is strong especially with the accent. Those little human spark time warm the equation. For the 3rd course, it is a great wrap-up for the specialization. I love the amazing story and how to provide an accurate estimation just through the dimensional analysis. I believe it will inspire people to explore the beauty of math. It worth all the effort!There are some minor mistakes in this specialization, and I have provided all my findings. I hope it helps. ",0,1,Bo Yang,5886132

Examples given for better understanding before quizzes are more difficult then the questions in the actual quizzes, hence quiz questions feel simpler and easier.
