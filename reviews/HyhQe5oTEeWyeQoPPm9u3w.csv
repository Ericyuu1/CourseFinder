This is for me the main drawback, that really kills the motivation of studying the subject. Many concepts used are not properly explained but otherwise assumed, so external documentation is somewhat essential if one wants to understand what is going on. Also when explaining certain methods (e.g. HMM), I missed the relation with the previous topics. Overall a very sloppy course with much room for improvement.",0,4,Carlos Uziel Pérez Malla,13608386

4638063~COURSE!~HyhQe5oTEeWyeQoPPm9u3w,1586505475431,3,0,"I'm glad that I have enrolled this MOOC. Several month ago I have remembered my school interest - a molecular genetics. I decided to search something about technical and biological aspect of the subject. And if biological aspects were covered by books, the tech - wasn't. So I was looking for an introduction to bioinformatics and choosing between several courses. I needed in wide overview of modern issues, sources (DBs and scientific journals) and problems. The course covers all of them (including some journals like jmb, which I read know). I resolved questions for my self and now, I am able to move next and deeper in specific question. it is ""old school"" long classic course, in my case it is ideal match.However, course is not support by anyone. The forum is dead (at least 3 yeas). Absolutely awful midterm and final exams. Their tasks are not covered by lectures, don't educated you. Some of them even out-of-date and can't solved (especially in final exam). So even after you guessing answer - you still don't understand why it is correct (forum is dead, remember?). The most number of sections has supplemental reading - reference to original papers, but course doesn't offer any access to the papers and not all of them could be found at sci-hub or exist in open access, so you are not able to read them (unless you a re ready to spend 10+ usd for each). Many supplemental videos are in chines with eng. subtitles with too high speed of speech, so you are not able to read it. Some of them it is recorded student presentations, don't think they were made for the course.",0,2,Николай Соколовский,4638063

From biotechnology background that I come from, 30 % of the tools and materials were familiar, but had difficulty understanding mathematical/statistics terms and theories. Though the lecturer explained it very well, it took a significant time to catch up with. The course helped me to build a foundation on basic tools and applications, and revisiting some of the biotechnology applications. I now realize my strong and weak spots in the subject and expecting more courses like this for deeper understanding.I think, the information on tools need updating. For example, KOBAS had a different UI and updated functionalities by the time I reviewed the chapter. Otherwise, the materials are top quality.",0,0,ARAVIND P M,77567256

The teaching staff is also very good. What made me not give the course 5 stars was mainly the tests. In addition to most of the questions being confusing (probably due to the English translation), many were not fully addressed in class. Also, the videos of the supplementary material are mostly in Chinese and although there are English subtitles, it is very difficult to follow the video and subtitles at the same time. I also think the course needs an update in its content. I'm taking the course in 2022, and most of the data is from 2013, which I imagine is the date the course was created.
