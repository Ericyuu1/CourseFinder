58812159~COURSE!~OjZYLlApEeaAmBJfqzpttQ,1663149630468,1,0,The course content is indeed good...now the little scam you have here with addind assignments on weeks that were already finished and failing students at their last assignment so that they pay another month is disgusting and this is why I didn't finish the last course. I've paid way too much for this and I have advise against using this in my own social enterprise and the University I teach in Sydney. Absolutely disgusting,0,0,Loic Pedras,58812159
77250585~COURSE!~OjZYLlApEeaAmBJfqzpttQ,1621054836826,3,0,"Still (part 3 of Coursera specialization) great fun and learning in our luckily stable core group, here writing the business plan. Finally also a mentor was assigned which was helpful. Overall good value for the money of course.Less good: hardly any other co-students are left at this stage to peer-review the assignments. A second mentor was assigned (late, why?), who never answered. And as throughout the course, the relation between Coursera instructions and the CBS project were not consistent. E.g. does the business plan have to be a separate document (as we did) or just a link to the Babele website (as the few others I could review did essentially)?It seems.CBS is not focusing energy in improving the.Coursera route, but is very active otherwise, currently Covid-wise, which is both understandabke and laudable. But the drop off rate and missing reviews are not the best sign.",0,0,Urs Wolf,77250585
