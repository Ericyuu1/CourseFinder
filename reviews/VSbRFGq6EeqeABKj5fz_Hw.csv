65103219~COURSE!~VSbRFGq6EeqeABKj5fz_Hw,1593792235200,1,0,I am not very happy with this course. The instructor just rushes through some inside his formerly prepared jupyter notebook and his explanations on the actual code snippets are very short and not very understandable. Also he needs to work on his presentation skills as he struggles a lot during with finding the right words for his explanations during the course. This could have been prepared a lot better.,0,0,Maximilian Bertram,65103219
