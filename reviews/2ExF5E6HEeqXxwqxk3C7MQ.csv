930730~COURSE!~2ExF5E6HEeqXxwqxk3C7MQ,1592766599145,1,0,Terrible course — do not expect to learn anything about Tensorflow Serving. 90% of the course is about building a rudimentary flask app,0,3,Indrajit Rajtilak,930730

79786297~COURSE!~2ExF5E6HEeqXxwqxk3C7MQ,1627941648839,2,0,"I​ am afriad this presentation really doent work as a format. I got half way through and the model simply wouldnt run, then had to go back through an hours coding - re watching to see where I made a typo. I found it eventually (a combination of not being able to code as fast as the tutor was talking, and the fact that he said one thing, then went back to change it later - and I missed the silent change.A​nywhay then the corrected code  wouldnt run because it seemed to still be running the wrong code, and I ran out of time and patience - it isnt a two hour course - at leadt not for me.I​ think the format needs seriulsy rethinking - the explanations and instructions are confusing, and delivered too quickly - it became an exercise in 'monkey see - monket do"" with no real understanding of images, servers, ports, forwards, and a host of chained other stuff - it really needed a slide, or a picture to explain the complex chain of 'somethings' we were suppose to set up.I​ would have better understood, and had more success I suspect with a longer, better explianed, and more well supported course like most of the ones I have found on Coursera - and that is my suggestion to the authors and instructors.",0,0,David Bush,79786297
3571417~COURSE!~2ExF5E6HEeqXxwqxk3C7MQ,1589560719027,2,0,The course is too basic. The course doesn't even train the model. It would be much better to prepare everything from model creation to deploy and serve. The browser-based tool used to code is horrible.,0,0,Jean Metz,3571417

19232793~COURSE!~2ExF5E6HEeqXxwqxk3C7MQ,1614315038531,3,0,"I do not recommend taking this type of course, take one and pass it, however after a few days I have tried to review the material, and my surprise is that it asks me to pay again to be able to review the material. Of course coursera gives me a small discount for having already paid it previously.
It is very easy to download the videos and difficult to get hold of the material, but with ingenuity it is possible. Then I recommend uploading them to YouTube and keeping them private for when they want to consult (they avoid legal problems and can share with friends), then they can request a refund.

I particularly liked the application of the Bootstrap library, which I didn't use yet.  As a potential for improvement I would like to propose more coverage of TensorFlow Service itself (I guess it is also possible build and train new models - but maybe this is beyond the scope of a short project...)
