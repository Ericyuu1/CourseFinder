I found it very one-sided and lacking enough information about the complications or difficulties in breastfeeding and subsequent trouble shooting for this. I understand that this course seemed tailored towards women who know nothing about breastfeeding and the benefits, but by only providing the benefits (and then shaming those who do not breastfeed) it only continues to perpetuate the shame that women feel if they are unable to breastfeed. Propaganda for formula led to the decline in breastfeeding. The answer to increasing breastfeeding rates is not more propaganda, but EDUCATION. I am also somewhat disappointed as I was hoping for a course that was more targeted towards health professionals, but that is my mistake for not reading the course outline more carefully.

I personally agree that breastfeeding is preferable to formula feeding in an overwhelming majority of cases, but I do not see why presenting the scientific data in a concise, easy to understand manner was considered insufficient, and the authors felt the necessity to fluff up the content by opinions of apparently random people of different ethnicities from around the world. ""People like us"", I presume. So, should we be making such decisions based on opinions of others? And if you show people the opinions of only pro-breastfeeding mothers, that should be helpful in tipping the balance of opinions they receive and make them supporters of breastfeeding because... we assume that they cannot think for themselves based on facts alone, and need ready-made opinions to be bottle-fed to them, too? Is the case for breastfeeding so weak that it cannot be supported on facts alone?Parts of the advice was well supported by reasons, but the rest was just offered as the best practice without any evidence as to why. Why is it best to keep breastfeeding until the child is 2 or older? Because this provides passive immunity for the child. OK. Perhaps we should keep it up till the child is 5? 7? 12? Maybe there is a critical cut-off point, considering the development of the child's immune system, around age 2, but we do not need to know. Opinions are all we need. It is stated that breastfeeding is the best option for an HIV positive mother to feed her child. Period. No alternative views are possible. It may well be the case. But I am not convinced. Please tell me why. Or maybe just have a random woman tell me that it is the best thing to do without indicating why, and I will become a believer.The quizzes provide good examples but why was it necessary to give names to mothers in those scenarios? Is it a psychological aid? Would people not be able to empathize without it? Will the people in rural villages in Brazil, who may or may not have access to clean drinking water, but somehow have access to the internet, enroll in this MOOC, but might feel a bit alien so we help them out by making the protagonist of the case ""Maria Eduarda, a 21-year-old woman living in a rural village in northern Brazil""?
