73757257~COURSE!~c1njRLZEEeWEoAqTi6kTYw,1663910907071,1,0,"Tâ€‹he worst course I've ever taken!!!!! Don't wast your time unless you are very rich and have nothing to do. They asked 5 peer revview to pass the course for each project, and they force you to read the optional material otherwise you can't pass the quiz. They only test the hardest part in the quiz to keep you as long as you can in each course so that they can earn money. Anyone see this PLEASE RUN AWAY FROM THIS WORST COURSE!!!!

1361500~COURSE!~c1njRLZEEeWEoAqTi6kTYw,1471008210232,1,0,"I took all 5 previous courses in this series and they were all great.But suddenly Coursera has changed its policy, and one can not take courses for free anymore. If you just want to learn and gain knowledge without chasing the certificate, than the course is useless, because you can't receive feedback for your work.  ",0,2,Pini,1361500

I learned more by goolging the stuff it's teaching on my own than listening to presentations. If you are taking as part of the specialziation, bite the bullet. Otherwise, there are better algo courses. ",0,0,Gman,101933139
38791132~COURSE!~c1njRLZEEeWEoAqTi6kTYw,1578520193849,3,0,"Pros:Lots of good material to learn. Challenging. Lectures are easy to understand.Cons:More dense, textbook-jargon ""CS major"" feel to this class than the others. Expect to spend more hours and have less fun vs. parts 1-4. Much easier to get discouraged. Major problems waiting for assignments to go through peer grading process, sometimes taking *weeks*.Suggestions:More basic handouts such as: 1) Set notation cheat sheet. 2) Pseudocode examples fully decoded into simple language. Also, watching a visualization of the base-pairing algorithm (Needleman-Wunsch) is highly recommended for understanding what you're trying to do. You can google it, but it would be nice if they added it to the course. Also, more smiling.In summary, it's a challenging course and I'm a better programmer for having finished it. However, it's more daunting, took me longer, and lacks the easy going/encouraging/illustrative style of the earlier courses. Peer grading takes way too long, especially if you're paying for a subscription.(My review applies to both Algorithmic Thinking Parts 1 and 2)",0,2,Daniel Wenzke,38791132
