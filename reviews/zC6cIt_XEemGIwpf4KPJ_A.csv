All you need is either copy-paste commands from the instruction or run all the cells in the notebook. No thinking, no sir. And in order to do these ""assignments"" they don't use coursera's local notebooks and grader, no. They use GCP, in incognito mode, and there are problems:
1. GCP's interface changed, so some of the labs' guidelines are not much relevant and you need to find stuff yourself.2. For jupyter notebook, the education notebook itself is not the most time-consuming part. You will login to GCP, create notebook, wait ten minutes for it to be created (but GCP won't show it, you need to close the tab and relogin to GCP again to see ""open jupyterlab""). And then, after 10 minutes you run and read all the cells for a minute. Yep, time management3. Btw, GCP is in incognito mode. What if it forgets you right in the middle of ""education"" process? Say you do ""git clone"" or run the notebook and bum, nothing works, GCP asks you to re-login. Yea, boy, start all over: login, create notebook, wait for it to say ""open jupyterlab"", etc... 


Summary, the finance part seem good and clear. ML part is weak. Labs are just torture to waste of time and nerves. Questions they ask also are unclear and structured in a pattern matching manner of ""words from lecture - question"". One of the worst courses I've ever head.

I had to close my eyes while listening to some of the lecturers because the way of lecturing is very unnatural, and it is a distraction. Sometimes watching the presenter helps in learning because you can connect to their mind, but sometimes their hand movements, gestures, the way they look at the camera, and all these things are simply distractions. But I must also mention some advantages of this course. 1- You will learn about some keywords on the topic of Trading using ML.
