57702171~COURSE!~yaJi8EQ4EeiajA5pPRmC1g,1596045059490,3,0,"The course, as well as the rest of the specialization are designed for statisticians rather than MDs and it's a pity that the amount of math in the course constantly take away its clinical scope. It's so much math-heavy that other very important principles of public health are scarcely mentioned, like the types of statistical tests depending on the variable types. Yes there are a lot of examples from the literature but there is absolutely no indication on how to use the formulas on a computer program, which program is best for what purpose etc., which could greatly enhance the usefulness of a course like this. Otherwise you need to attend other courses as you lack the practical skills of applying the statistics into action.Also, the instructor should not just constantly read his bullet points from the slides, rather than try to explain the material in his own voice.",0,4,Ioannis Koulas,57702171

Each lectures have 2 or 3 points, which could have been communicated in a simple manner. The instructor gives lengthy explanations and I felt lost.Some the exercises had errors. During lectures instructor starts writing with pen, instead, he could have written it before and explained in shorter sentences.In  exercise feed backs, our responses were not shown, which was makes it harder to know our answers and rectify our mistakes.It also would have been helpful to  recommend a software and to actually show us how to organize the date and how to use software.Overall I felt that course was theoretical and I could have learned the concepts in 1 to 3 days, instead of going through lengthy lectures",0,2,shekhar Raj,63561505

I feel that you need to do all four courses to truly appreciate all the lessons.W​hat I think will improve the courses: There are some mistakes in the quizzes and the answer sheets, and I think it is because Dr McGready used the lectures that he uses in his classes at JHU, but had to transcribe the quizzes into the Coursera format. I feel that the lectures would have had even greater value if we got to program some of the statistics and manipulate some of the data in R or SPSS.O​verall, I really enjoyed the specialisation, and I certainly got what I was looking for.
