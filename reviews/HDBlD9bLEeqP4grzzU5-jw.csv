84433329~COURSE!~HDBlD9bLEeqP4grzzU5-jw,1624440896336,3,0,It was ok but the instructor seemed pretty disinterested in the material. There are far better tkinter series on Youtube (Codemy channel for a start) which shouldn't be the case when students are paying a subscription.,0,0,Wayne Katz,84433329

Books have been written on Tk and Tkinter, so in a one hour project you can only introduce the basics and show some concepts. This project delivers on that.",0,0,Martijn Posthuma,8801364
38197796~COURSE!~HDBlD9bLEeqP4grzzU5-jw,1607417994379,4,0,"Basically, it needs to have a understanding on the Class declaration of Python. I think the lecturer should need to discuss why are we doing a class declaration and how it works. Also, the lecture can be expanded up to using thread and using other different gui indicators such as progress bars and percentages, threading, gui loop refresh, etc. But this is a good basic tutorial for tkinter gui making",0,0,Kien Francis G.

The following is my opinion.The project was interesting to follow but, in my opinion, it did not give the tools to then create its own project because, again in my opinion, there are no explanations on how to use the tkinter methods. The instructor proved to know very well which method to use and how to implement it but he did not pass me the knowledge of how to operate outside the specific project created by him.",0,0,Antonio Coco,67624421
