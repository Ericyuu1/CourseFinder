55794402~COURSE!~lXNlz0B0EeWKOBLv1z6n9w,1617234824111,1,0,"A great and moving set of lectures spoiled by the PEER REVIEW essays. The 2d one had absolutely nothing to do with the course and the instructor waned (get this) 3,000 words in the essay!  No wonder no one wants to take this one.  There's no learners in the course to do peer reviews! And 6 modules of information with a quiz of 120 multiple choices, that you have to take to progress but (get this again) count nothing towards a grade for the Certificate!  and it seems this one has been abandoned by the tutors and the Coursera learner community.  Finally, (get this for sure) the MOST RECENT Discussion Posts are 5 YEARS OLD.   An awful experience.  NO STARS. ",0,2,Bryan Ferrick,55794402
36400529~COURSE!~lXNlz0B0EeWKOBLv1z6n9w,1650462706750,3,0,"There is a lot of old data in the presentations and course materials, as well as other contextual information in the course. It's clear the materials haven't been looked at by anyone at Coursera or CU in quite some time. I'm also not a fan of the ""peer grading"" system. In my case a ""peer,"" who I gave a low grade because he did not come close to completing the assignment, retaliated by giving me a poor score on a paper I worked very hard on and in which I clearly articulated background points, impetus and stats for the suggestions, and recommended actions/measures.

The lecturers are great overall. Dr. Skip Burkle in particular is a charismatic speaker with an incredible breadth of knowledge and experience. Coursera should have better guidelines for updating their course materials. This has been a rather disappointing first brush with a global health course I was excited to fully complete.",0,1,Mary Krysten McLarty,36400529
568816~COURSE!~lXNlz0B0EeWKOBLv1z6n9w,1460491018305,4,0,"The presentation and content of lectures were compelling, motivating and disturbing.  Very well done.  No one really responded on the forums.  This may have been because of small class size.  In other classes I have taken on coursera the forums are quite active, and an instructor weighs in from time to time to answer questions or be present.  Assignments were peer graded, so much was gained from reading other students interpretation of the material.I suggest putting the additional reading lists at the end of each unit, or in a separate side bar.  They were hard to find in the syllabus.Overall an extremely worthwhile course.",0,0,Karen R Lied,568816
16686676~COURSE!~lXNlz0B0EeWKOBLv1z6n9w,1454788351739,4,0,Foundations for Global Health Responders offers an introduction to global health issues tailored for those interested in global health missions. The course includes video presentations and discussions by numerous physicians associated with the University of Colorado School of Medicine as well as several other subject-matter experts. I found the presentations and supplemental materials helpful in gaining a basic understanding that I can expand upon in the future. Well worth your time if you are interested in participating in global health missions but are not sure what area you might like to focus on!,0,0,Ryan Moore,16686676
