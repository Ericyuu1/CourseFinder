51993576~COURSE!~aRtcBiQDEeSddyIACzYDOg,1623536392216,3,0,"Only three stars despite excellent content (delivery for a paid option should be better)
•	The content is extremely interesting and it is clear that a lot of effort was put in preparing the course. Very good downloadable presentations, fantastic summaries (topic summaries) at the end of each module. The second part even more interesting that the first one. 
•	There are errors in English. The second part delivered by the second instructor was worse, the delivery sometimes hindered the understanding and thus caused frustration. Not being an English native speaker myself, I understand this is easier said than done. However, the course was made available on a global platform in English, so one expects it to be easy to understand, especially for those as myself who purchased a certificate. 
 Does Coursera verify the course before putting it on the platform?  Courses with poor content or poor delivery should be available for auditing only, without possibility to buy a certificate. •	There are many assignments. Maybe one could consider replacing some of them by short mandatory tests after each module or chapter (and not only a final test at the end). Short tests at the end of each module would allow better understanding of the material, which would be memorised longer…
