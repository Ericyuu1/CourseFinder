85966527~COURSE!~2dHcFsRdEeW2JxKnR3RyOw,1627901269390,1,0,"First off, how do you get off teaching a class with an R specialization without even explaining some of the most basic operators and functions of R first? Or barely teaching R at all when the name implies you will learn a lot of R. Well they've managed to do it here. As a result, I had to dig around the internet for several days to learn some of the core functions of R that should have been taught by this class. 

While we are on that subject, I wasn't taught anything that I actually wanted to learn R for...things like the t-test, ANOVA, CFA, etc. Instead you just learn how to do random stuff like pnorm functions and how to filter variables (or how to run dplr without explaining why the piping function '%>%' matters). As much as its good to brush up on the basics like histograms and boxplots, the core tests that are extremely common and useful to learn are to my great amazement missing. Idk how you can run a stats course without even a single explanation of a t-test.

During the various times I was confused by the teaching, I would normally refer to my book, but the book chapters they give you literally never align with what you're learning that week, which is astounding given the whole point of a book is for reference.  I checked to make sure I had the most recent book, and even with having the most up to date text, its completely disconnected from the video content.

You're better off  just Googling and YouTubing whatever you wanna learn (which is basically what I did since it was free and much easier to understand).

Mentors are reallly of great help, they are doing a great job, honestly: they are very active, they give good insights, they know the subject matter.But in the course lectures, there are occasions where concepts are used which were not formally introduced before their actual use. One example: in the lectures on probability, the first ""slide"" in the lecture talks about random processes, outcomes of random process,... On the next slide, the notion of probability of an event is introduced, but the very notion of ""event"" was never introduced. It is introduced in the accompanying book, but if it is the case that the book chapters should be read PRIOR to watching the course videos, that fact should be made clear.Further in the course on probability, some words are used ""interchangeably"" without the context making it clear why they can be used interchangeably. For instance, on some occasions, the concept of independent events is used, but then, later on, the discussion talks of independent processes. Which is which??? Is there a difference? If so, what is it? When do I need to use independent events as opposed to independent processes?The graded assignments are of varying quality. The most disturbing thing about them is that, on some occasions, concepts are used in the quiz questions (either directly in the questions and answer choices, or indirectly in the ""correction"" for the quiz after you have submitted it) that were never touched upon in the course.I have had two occasions of concepts not introduced in the course but used in the graded assignments. The first occurrence of a gap between course content and quiz questions was on a quiz question about inference. I failed the question, and understood why I failed based on the course content litterally minutes after failing the question (and one mentor actually rightly corrected me). But the question ""correction"" (the explanation text you receive after submitting, as justification for what the correct answer is) referred to the concept of ""two-sided hypothesis test"". Where did THAT come from?? I checked and rechecked the course videos, no mention at all of it. I checked the accompanying book, and the first mention of two-sided hypothesis test is way way way further in the book, in a chapter that is entirely focusing on inference.The second occurrence was in week 4. The course lectures cover two distributions: normal and binomial. The recommended reading in the book also focus on these two distributions (the recommended reading actually skips the section on geometric distribution, if I remember well). But in one of the quiz question, there was one of the possible answers referring to the geometric distribution. If it is the case that we are supposed to know and understand about geometric distributions, then the course content should cover the subject. Or at the very least, the course lecture should mention clearly that learners are advised to read about it in the accompanying book.The guidelines for the project assignment (week 5) are not all that clear as to what is expected from the learners. Sure, there are instructions on where to find the info, what structure should be followed,... There is also a very nice ""example"" project (designed by one of the mentors), which provides a lot of useful info (how to filter missing values from variables,...). But there is no real hint as to the depth of analysis we are expected to complete. This is definitely a source of confusion, not only for me, but also for a few other learners, from what I gathered in the discussion forums. The result is that the projects you get to review are of very disparate levels. Some end up in calculating one figure per research question, without any attempt at deriving trends or patterns, others do not include any plots at all,... The thing is that the peer review criteria do not really provide a good basis to ensure that learners did indeed assimilate the course contents. Most of the questions in the peer review assignment have a lot more to do with following a canvas and not so much with the course substance itself. For instance, some of the peer review criteria have to do with the narratives for computed statistics and plots. The criteria are: ""Is each plot/R outout followed by a narrative"", ""Does the narrative correctly interpret the plots, or statistics"", ""Does the narrative address the research question"". But when the research question is a question of the type ""What it the IQR for income per state"", for instance, the narrative can be very short: ""IQR per state shows that the state with higher variability of income is..."".  So, the narrative meets the 3 evaluation criteria: there is a narrative, it does address the research question, and it does correctly interpret the statistics. But it is not particularly useful. I do understand that Internet-based peer review is challenging, and that you have to settle for ""neutral"" criteria that are easy to assess by learners. But the peer review grading ""grid"" as it currently stands is not ""that"" helpful in assessing whether the course contents has been assimilated.To conclude, when I took the course, my initial plan was to follow the entire specialization. But after having completed the first course of the specialization, I have radically changed my mind, and will look for alternatives ""elsewhere"" to get the knowledge/skillset that I am after.",0,0,Philippe Remy,19042672

I'm finishing the 2nd course two (inferential statistics) and I have the same feeling there. We spend video after video learning the nuts and bolts of the math behind, but at times we are only given the code in R. Sometimes the code is not even given!! The same with ggplots. The real-life applicability of the knowledge here is to make sure you are able to use the software to run the analysis. It's important to understand the logic behind, surely, but no one will, professionally, do the calculations by hand. I left this and will leave the second course (Inferential statistics) with the feeling that I've learnt much more the maths than how to actually use R.One final thought: at times, in stats, the most difficult thing is to decide which test to implement. There are possibilities, but which one? Why? How to I check for Skeweness in R (the number, not the histogram). What is considered too much skewness? What is too large a bias in bootstrapping?

To get a stronger grip on statistics I took this course alongside Stanford's ""Introduction to Statistics"" as well as University of Michigan's ""Understanding and Visualizing Data with Python"". Doing all courses at the same time is definitely helpful, but by far this course had the most clear, informative, and applicable information. 1) The use of diagrams to explain concepts was a great way to visualize data. 2) The examples used are all relevant and give dynamic interaction between you and statistics. 3) The assesments were very well made and at the appropiate level when compared ot content. One thing I will note is that the R introductions aren't extremely beginner friendly, and I still managed because I've been coding with R for the past 8 months.

However, the main reason that I took this class was because of R studio and implementation of statistics via R studio. First 2 weeks were perfect, the only lacking part was the 3rd week (I think R assignment could be better. Obviously, we did not need much effort to complete Week 3 R assignment which I did not like). Week 5 project, on the other hand, was just on point. We could apply everything we learnt throughout the course; especially, reviewers were strict and gave constructive feedback which I liked a liked a lot. One more thing, some people might want to start learning R studio via video tutorials, which this course does not have. However, R markdown was very good method for learning purposes.

The use of RMarkdown was not that easy, but somehow manageable with trial and error, and the knitting to html was also a little cumbersom. My main problem was that the week 5 assignment was not very clear and demanded more from the inspiration and creativity of the student in coming up with original research questions than on how to handle them and put them in R. As a consequence, the line of thinking risked to be reversed: first you realize what you can handle in 'R' and then, you create a question that can be handled... Perhaps, I would have preferred a first research question, formulated by the teachers, where only the concepts and programming already taught are to be used, before letting us free in the wild. Another consequence of the total open question is that the more fancy assignments that I could review, were those that used more R packages/commands than we were supposed to know already...

But, I knew what I was letting myself in for.Another warning to physical science students: The data for the final project is CDC health survey responses for 2013.

I've audited couple other courses, and I took relevant courses back in college a while ago, Dr. Mine is the best out of all the professors I've met at explaining things. This is not in this course but next, but just as an example of how clear she is when explaining standard deviation of sample means. She takes time to combine a specific example, visualization, and simulation,  to really make all the points clear. You could try to listen to her on that part in the next course week 1. Second, the R practice in every week is very beneficial and helpful. The cases used in those practices are fun to work with too. The hands-on experience on R and data exploring is valuable.

The lectures are clear, concise and based on interesting examples. The course also comes with a textbook for which you can pay what you want, even a price of zero. The textbook is also very well written and contains plenty of examples to illustrate concepts that are introduced and lots of practice problems too. This is crucial for developing a good understanding of the material taught in a course like this.I do have one warning about this course, however. The learning curve for the programming aspect of it is very steep. It says no previous knowledge of R is required, but I don't think I would've been able to finish my final project if I hadn't already taken about 15 other courses (mostly on DataCamp) that focused on R programming. At the very least, you should take the free Introduction to R course on DataCamp before you start any of the labs for this course. Ideally, you should also get a DataCamp membership and work through about 60% of the courses on the Data Scientist with R track before even starting this course.I realize that sounds like a lot to ask, and that I am contradicting the course description that was written by the instructors, but this course makes use of a great deal of the knowledge that is taught on that track, especially the dplyr and ggplot2 packages, from the first module. Dplyr in particular is a wonderful R package that does things I've always dreamed of while struggling to do basic things in Excel, but it takes a lot of practice to get the hang of it you will get much more out of this course if you already have some experience with dplyr (and ggplot2) before starting it.",0,0,Gabriel Harrison Butler,1317928

The textbook that accompanies the course is freely available in pdf format online and the suggested exercises are a great complement to the rest of the course materials.For those unfamiliar with R, the project is a bit of a leap from the rest of the contents in the course. To get around that, I'd suggest to both use the discussion forum (posts by mentor David Hood are particularly helpful) and to take both the R programming course and the Exploratory Data Analysis course from the Johns Hopkins data science sequence. Those 2 should together be doable in 5-6 weeks and at that point you should have sufficient background to where doing the project in this course (and those in follow-up courses in this specialization) should not be a problem.",0,0,Raw Noob,16686338

I have struggled for years to understand and get the hang of statistics, at uni, with online courses and at work. With this course (and the following courses) I think I have finally gained a DEEPER understanding of some of the basic but very important concepts of statistics. Lots of detailed examples and no overly complicated maths gibberish (although still mathematically sound!).  The R programming bits run in parallel to the statistics lectures and can be followed (necessary for a certificate) or can be ignored (if you only want to grasp the concepts), but are overall very easy to understand and follow. There is only little background to R as a programming language and the different types of data, lists, matrices etc. To me that's a good thing, as it allows you to use R right away (which in turn makes me more motivated to go back and learn more about R).
