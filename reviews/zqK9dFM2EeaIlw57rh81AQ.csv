2261564~COURSE!~zqK9dFM2EeaIlw57rh81AQ,1570385008241,1,0,"The three courses were shameful attempts to reconcile science with religion using as an example religious pseudosciences. In all courses, the theme  ""Intelligent Design"" was approached, but in this specific there was a desperate attempt to link Buddhism to Quantum Entanglement, which are two completely opposite things. In general, the course aims to indoctrinate based on pseudoscience rather than teaching science, philosophy and religion in a critical and systematic way. Perhaps this is the main reason why the course is sponsored by the obscure and pseudoscientific John Templeton Foundation.",0,2,Douglas Rodrigues Aguiar de Oliveira,2261564

well presented, but of the three linked courses, this is noticeably the weakest
and most uneven from a pedagogic point of view. With a third of the material (both
in terms of teaching and student participation) being concentrated in one week
(week 3), one felt either this section was too long, or that one was being
short changed with regard to the other topics.I also found many discussion topics annoyingly vague,
spending more time trying to work out what was one was supposed to talk about
than actually talking about it, while most of the quizzes were so ludicrously
simple they were a waste of time.",0,0,Bob Moore,46625408

Perhaps my criticism is unjustified but while each thread stood alone and there was surprisingly little overlap, there would have been a benefit in even a single video that brought the threads together.  Additionally, with the exception of Dr Priest's exposition of Buddhism with hints of Hinduism, the course is very Judaeo Christian focussed, (and mostly on the Christian aspects) so Islam, one of the five great faiths, is broadly ignored as are the animists, Zoroastrians and Baha'i.

While some may bristle at its inclusion, it enlivened the overall impact. On the other hand, although I've studied Buddhism before and was familiar with a lot of Prof Priest's week 3 material, I though too much emphasis was given it compared to what other Buddhist thinkers might have added. However, the overall course I found valuable, and I liked in some parts the diminished amount of quizzes, as in the Buddhist section, to instead look at personal reflections and insights we all could add to the mix.",0,0,John L.
