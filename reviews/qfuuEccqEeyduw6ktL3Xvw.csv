49686345~COURSE!~qfuuEccqEeyduw6ktL3Xvw,1675993365864,3,0,同専門講座内の他のコースと比べると、作りこみが荒いと思う。・ソースコードのインデントがめちゃくちゃで読みにくい。間違っているところが多々ある・ビデオのデモが速すぎて目で追いきれない。１倍速での理解が困難・テストで全く同じ問題が2問出てきたりする,0,0,Yukihiro Fujita,49686345
9447702~COURSE!~qfuuEccqEeyduw6ktL3Xvw,1674108055454,3,0,"The course has good tutorials on the various aspects of Kotlin, however the clear disregard for proofreading brings it down two stars. There are errors practically everywhere, both in the writing of the lessons, as well as in the programming code. I expected better from Meta. It almost makes me want to give up on the whole Specialization, but I likely won't. I'll just have to be prepared for future courses to be poorly edited, as well, and get whatever educational material I can out of them the best I can.",0,1,Dan Tinsley,9447702

They often call upon some technicality introduced on the previous page, instead of checking for logical understanding.

On few of the questions there are typos that should change the answer.S​ome questions do not have a unique answer, yet the radio-button selection only allows for a single choice.",0,0,Aleksandar Shurbevski,99928103
