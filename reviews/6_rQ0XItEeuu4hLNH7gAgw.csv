118979546~COURSE!~6_rQ0XItEeuu4hLNH7gAgw,1672290888779,1,0,Absolutely terrible. Several of the quizzes are VB questions with no mention of the VB language. Some questions have wrong answers. These issues have been noted for at least a year and nothing has been done to fix the course. This course is not detailed enough for an absolutely beginner and should not be labeled as an introduction. I was able to work through the course due to my previous Python experience. Not recommended for new learners or anyone for that matter. ,0,0,Zachary Avant,118979546
60224381~COURSE!~6_rQ0XItEeuu4hLNH7gAgw,1664159019129,1,0,"A​bsolutely terrible course. Why? All kind of mistakes. For example in Week 2 two of the practive quizzes were quizes on Visual Basic not Python. How did that happen? In the videos where it would prompt the viewer a question it would present wrong answers to the question like in one example it asked what the sum was for a loop and it was 15(or maybe 21. Can't remember) but the answers you could only choose from where 1,2 or 3. Even in the graded quizzes there was at least one example where it marked the right answer as wrong and the wrong answer as right. This example I'm talking about asked the test taker what does this evaluate to: not False or True. It evaluates to true(just try it out it in interactive python shell to see) but that was marked as the wrong answer.  Also the visual studie for Python that we were supposed to use didn't really work at least at handling the input function to get input from the user. I would type something and it wouldn't appear. So I'm without a doubt NOT continueing with the rest of the specialization.  Too many mistakes that should have been caught",0,0,Dennis Lund,60224381

There are typos throughout the course, plus many instances of code that wouldn't work within Python. In addition, there were two quizzes that were about Visual Basic, but since this is a Python course, they shouldn't have been in this course. There also were a few instances where the quizzes didn't give credit for the correct answers. Hopefully LearnQuest will fix all the issues, since then I think this could be a decent course. Until then, though, I'd stay away because there are far better Python courses out there than this one.",0,1,Dan Tinsley,9447702
