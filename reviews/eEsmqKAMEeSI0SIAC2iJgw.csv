Too much math (I really didn't know the derivation of every equation to get the gist of the information) and I did not really find the subject matter truly engaging until the last 3 weeks or so.Aside from my personal issues with the course, I do not think it is suited to a MOOC format.  The slides shown during the lectures were very hard to read, especially the ones with white backgrounds.  Some of the questions pertained specifically to the day the lecture was given (""What planets are in the sky tonight?"" can only be answered if you know what day the question was asked!) and some of the information  outlined is now out of date.  Most importantly, all of the grading in this class is done by peer-review.  It's hard to do that unless there is a group all taking the class at the same time.

This is my fifth astronomy MOOC and by far and away a country mile the best; how many of those in a parsec?.Apart from the sheer breadth of subject matter covered I particularly liked the way various maths formulae (not too difficult) were explained and gradually used to explain and link various aspects of astronomy - thus adding weight to the explanations and especially how it all elegantly fits together.  If you want to do just one course to understand astronomy, this is the one.Many thanks to David and team  for the high quality of lectures and diagrams etc. which thoroughly backed up the lectures + the interviews provided insight form other experts in their respective fields.

14161424~COURSE!~eEsmqKAMEeSI0SIAC2iJgw,1454031584522,5,0,"I took this course completely for fun, so did not complete any assignments, but I want to say that I enjoyed it immensely! Our lecturer brought immense enthusiasm to the rather heavy topic of astronomy and physics and managed to make it reasonable even to those of a non-science background (like me!). The people interviewed also brought very unique views and experiences to the subject, and gave us a good first hand account of what it is like to research and work on NASA projects and other spacefaring missions. Thank you to everyone who made this happen, I hope many other students share the same satisfaction from taking this online course!",0,5,Hui Jun Heng,14161424
