84953831~COURSE!~EwR6zhSDEeWCWhKuhISYpw,1622208114050,1,0,"T​his course has so many dead links. The course provides a great deal of links to other sources of information and it suggests that you read them, however most of the links don't work and haven't worked for years. The so called ""Help Desk"" at Coursera was useless in resolving this issue. The course contradicts itself in some areas which is annoying. It states in one area that the first stars were formed 200 million years after the big bang and then it states in another chapter that they were formed 540 million years after the big bang and based on outside reading the actual answer is 100 million years. T​he course also pushes the Global Warming, eh, I mean Climate Change, eh, I mean Climate Crisis narative in the final chapter. There is no need to place a progressive spin on the course. Just state the facts, including all of the predictions that proponents of global warming have made that have failed to be true. T​he tests are super easy and are hardly University level material. Multiple choice, open book, with the option to re-take over and over. The final essay is 50% of the grade and is ambiguous in what the essay is expected to be about.  Instead of being about facts, it is about feelings. T​he course's discussion forum is a joke. There is no one on it. There are no staff or moderators. It is like entering a chat room and you are the only on on-line. I​ got much more out of the youtube series called Big History by Crash Course with John Green.

12290068~COURSE!~EwR6zhSDEeWCWhKuhISYpw,1474202391451,1,0,"Why is this course dangerous?I took this course because first I liked the idea to have a history lesson spanning the age of the whole universe. Maybe it is also intriguing to explain everything just with one principle: the second law of thermodynamics. BUT as it turned out they don't have any clue what this second law of thermodynamics means. They always forget the second part of it: it is just valide in a closed system. I think everbody will agree, that the earth for example isn't a closed system.In the beginning they tell you you should be critical about everything new you hear or get taught. But if you are critical and question things they teach you they will ignore you. One glance at the discussion forum shows: they are fast in answering good feedback and compliments by students, but critical questions (with scientific papers who show different facts) get ignored for weeks and months. They are cherry picking. They just see what encourages their view and their opinion and ignore everything that contradicts their course, opinion, believe and dogma. In this respect they are so dangerous. That is the same principle how cults work.Maybe their goal, stopping polluting and changing the world in such a speed seems to be a good one. But also here you have to be careful. When they talk about climate change and the overuse of ressources they are exaggerating by a factor of 50! In my opinion you are damaging an important discussion if you are lying and exaggerating in such a shameless way. For sure it is not helpful! But again, the truth doesn't fit in their world view. Furthermore they ""teach"" that cities get blown away by taifoons is caused by the ""universe balancing entropy"". This isn't just lack of understanding physics, or history, or flow mechanics, it is just insane.In summary: this is not a history course, but the ""teachings"" of a lying, exaggerating, cherry picking cult with no knowledge in particle physics, cosmology, chemistry, biology or even history.So please: if you take this course, be aware of this pitfalls and their intentions.",0,14,Kerstin Seier,12290068

But the rest of them, including the main course leader, were brilliant and seemed really invested in whatever they were teaching you. I feel there could have been more interactive activities offered. There were only quizzes at the end of the modules which were really easy and didn't take much effort or though usually. The content and the way that they structured the content of the course was brilliant though.

Course design and implementation are superb - drawing together substance and process from many disciplines contributing to our current understanding of the Universe. Encompassing the scope of 13.8 billion years in such an engaging, inclusive and enlightening manner is a brilliant achievement.The openness of this course is demonstrated through inclusion of experts from a wide range of science and humanities disciplines. For this reason it has enormous potential for embracing a wide range of learners' world views. [One suggestion, having read the small number of vehemently dismissive reviews, would be to also consider inclusion of a theological expert's perspective.] The four-pronged Claim Tester tool applied throughout the course has wide applicability in this age of social media bubbles and misinformation.I'm a retired educator seeking to learn how humanity is going to achieve the transformation in consciousness essential for following a path that will enable our young people and future generations to lead fulfilling lives on a healthy planet (Threshold Nine).

this story, and to think seriously on possible future scenarios of how the
universe, stars, and life on earth will evolve, acknowledging at the same time that
this approach still has many holes, as there are a lot of things that we don't
understand. For example, we don't understand why the Big Bang happened? Or
what is dark matter and dark energy, which together constitute more than 90% of
all matter in the universe.  This implies

If I had to nit-pick, it would be questioning the particular coverage placed upon China in the sub-topic of ""How did Modernity evolve after the Industrial Revolution?"" and the seemingly critical view taken towards its modernisation. One point in particular was ""We've achieved a war over nature. Where we've done it, there's a cost to ourselves, as the intensifying flooding in Shanghai often illustrates. Early in October 2013, Shanghai was hit by two typhoons which came together and saturated Shanghai with the heaviest rainfall ever recorded."" I'm not a Chinese citizen, but it sounded to me like China received her due comeuppance, which I felt was a little uncalled for.
