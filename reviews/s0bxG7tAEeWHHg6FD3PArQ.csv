The insights of the teacher are very useful in deciphering the keys to Chinese politics. However, the course has not been updated for many years (8 years? ), missing a period particularly relevant to understand the current state of politics in the country and making many of the debates and conclusions out of date. Moreover, most of the readings (even those that are mandatory) are not available, which does not make any sense.
