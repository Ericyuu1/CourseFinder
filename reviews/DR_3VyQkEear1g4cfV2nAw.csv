25788517~COURSE!~DR_3VyQkEear1g4cfV2nAw,1528292780108,1,0,"The aim of these three courses seems to be to persuade people that the debate about the compatibility or otherwise of Christianity (and there's very little attempt here to disguise the view that 'religion' means Christianity) and science is genuinely important.  Do they succeed?  I don't think so; the somewhat confusing view of science presented by the course creators - that scientists have deliberately chosen naturalism as their metaphysical foundation, refusing to acknowledge any supernatural possibility, and consequently need to 'change their story' whenever they encounter new evidence leaving science weak and unreliable but on the other hand, that science is so powerful and successful that 'scientism' is a real threat to the future of humanity - contrasts with the uncritical view of Christianity (what little critical assessment there is, is laughable in my view) to such an extent that any debate would be meaningless.  As far as I can see this remains a problem within Christianity between young earth fundamentalists and those, such as the Templeton Foundation who financed the courses, who want Christianity to be acceptable and relevant in modern society.  I think Christians should be free to believe whichever of the hundreds of different types of Christianity they want but that, in the same way that they don't want science imposing a naturalistic view on everyone, they shouldn't expect everyone else to believe the same things that they do.

of philosophy, science and religion was explained properly from an academic
standpoint of view. However, when I saw that the John Templeton Foundation was
involved in the production of the course, my expectations lowered exponentially.They rocketed to the ground, however, when I saw how several lectures
were biased towards treating scientific rigor as “fundamentalism” and when
their religious ideas merged in an obscene and weird mixture with post
modernism and critical theories to treat the scientific inquiry and knowledge
with a relativistic approach. Only an ignorant religious fundamentalist would mistake
the scientific inquiry with “naturalist fundamentalism” and misunderstand scientific
discovery as an equal in a pseudo-intellectual war with religion, which the
latter lost long time ago, rendering it obsolete.I have no problem with considering the religious hypothesis and to
examine them under the unbiased and objective glass of the scientific method.
However once said hypothesis they are the subject of the scientific method they
lose miserably, simply because they are based on faith and dogma.This course is a shame. The only thing it misses for being an absolute joke is to have Ken Ham as a guest “scientist” guest.

Since Hitler cannot be morally right in any stretch of the moral imagination, ultra-darwinianism is wrong.However, if Hitler wouldn't have initiated concentration camps and war, thus helping humanity prosper by creating room for more evolutionary diversity (which is key to progress), he wouldn't have been Adolf Hitler as we know him.Nevertheless, thought-provoking as hell.

is a lot more complicated than the average person appreciates.In
Week 5 Dr de Pomerai’s presentation on Evolutionary Biology was a dry as dust
recitation of facts. It felt a bit like being read tracts from the Bible and I think
really failed in the objective of establishing why Evolutionary Biology is a science.

Even if the other lecturers also delivered as it were their parts of the textbook on camera, they did not make it seem such. I add that those who somehow see this as propaganda for creationism or ID seem not to have accurately placed these portions in perspective.
