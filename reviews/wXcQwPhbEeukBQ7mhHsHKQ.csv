36374272~COURSE!~wXcQwPhbEeukBQ7mhHsHKQ,1653662998830,3,0,"i​t was a good course to get familiar with machine vision, image classification and object detection concepts. however, I guess it is not the best choice if you don't have access to Edge Impulse, Open MV, and Rapberry Pi, as most simulations and projects need them (as it is clear with the name of the course and partners). Maybe it wuld be bettet to be highlighted more clearly in the description.) Besides I think module 1 and 2 covering the basic ML concepts could be shorter and the last module on Object Detection needed more explanations and details. However, thanks for the course I learnt a lot.",0,4,azadeh gholaminejad,36374272
