This course is merely an introduction to vision for self-driving cars and does not discuss the related topics in depth.Second, given the fact that I have had some experience with neural networks, I sometimes could not agree with the solutions provided for the quizzes throughout the course. Even though I sent messages and tried to discuss my viewpoints, I received no response from lecturers or any teaching assistance.Thirds, there were in, my opinion, some errors in the lecture slides, and again even though I sent messages to ask if I am mistaking or if the slides contain typos and errors I received no response.Lastly, it is quite disturbing that even though this course has been available for years, no one made an effort to update some parts of the script (for programming assignments) which are erroneous (this was the last straw that broke the camel's back).I really am disappointed in this course, and if I knew this course was going to be like this, I would have never chosen it.Thank you for reading my comment.All the best ",0,0,Kiavash Fathi,91301159

It hasn't any expected results during the long code and compare only the final result at the submitting. But the most strange thing is that during this assessment student is supposed to do matrix equations that are not desired in lecture or supplementary material3 As one of the basic neural networks VGG is considered.
