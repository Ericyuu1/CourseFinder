The good part is that we can discover some artists and their artworks and working processes. The bad part is that there's no reflexion besides it. For an institution as MoMA with a curator's team of such a great quality, it's surprisingly poor and deceiving. Instructors / curators do not ""explain"", they don't establish bridges between artists, times and historic contextes. They don't do their basic work that is to conceive and present an exhibition (and this course can be considered as one because contemporary art is explained from a certain point of view and not from another) . So if you want to visit an art exhibition without many intellectual and reflexion work being handle to you to improve your thinking, it can be a very nice and interesting parade.

Most examples require a back-story or long explanation of the artist's intentions to begin to appreciate, as the work does not stand on it's own merits.

The thing is that you only get a peek of many themes and artists, without delving deeper into anything. The historical context given for the works is brief, but enough. Also, there are some external links for further studying. There are no specific methodologies or theoritical tools behind the course, so it feels more like a museum tour with a very good guide explaining to you, rather than a real study on contemporary art.S​o, I guess it depends on your expectations and background. If you're a curious person wanting to get a general picture of contemporary art, it is perfectly good for you. Also it might be good if you're an art student looking to broaden your horizons.

Five -six years ago, after being retired, I turned back to an old and stable hobby of mine - painting, and I decided that this time I will do it the right way. I found a painter, with a lot of practice in teaching, that I felt that she might be the one. I asked to do it from the beginning: sketching and drawing, then painting with dry and wet pastels, charcoal, carving, and printing, painting with acrylic and oil paints, watercolor, etc. She decided that I am good and throughout these years I became a beginner artist, spending from 3 hours to ~ 45-50 hours per week in artistic actions. Lately, I felt that I need knowledge, mainly with the modern art, but not only. IO Begun with ""What is Contemporary Art?"" The perfect choice. It was the first time I met the contemporary art. It widens one's (mine) horizons. And I felt, in the end, that it was just the right thing to do.
