I have expereince in forecasting and the topics cocered in this course in the series are out of date and the piees related to cyclical/judgemental are out of date, poorly explained and many of the statements are wrong including the quizzes.  I quit most of the way through because it seemed to be doing more harm than good.",0,0,David Carmichael,102602433

The course provided a great balance of theory and practical application, teaching me how to use both data and judgement to make more accurate forecasting predictions. The instructor was knowledgeable and engaging, making the material easy to understand and enjoyable to learn. The case studies and hands-on practice were particularly helpful in reinforcing the concepts taught in each week. Overall, I found the course to be very practical and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking to improve their forecasting skills and understand the role of judgement in forecasting.",0,0,Tanzeel Ur Rehman,78107758
