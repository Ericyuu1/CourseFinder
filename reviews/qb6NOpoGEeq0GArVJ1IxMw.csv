SAS lectures are optional, and they are just about 1-2 videos per week so don't expect you'll learn many things (barely scratching the surface).Newbies who want a taste of ML can try this course. Those who interested more in the technical stuff shouldn't subscribe to this one as there are better courses out there.",0,1,Derek Thompson,100001701

Each party needs to know a bit more - not too much, but enough - about the other's world to be effective together and deliver results.  Finding that balance of how much tech and data and how much business outcome to put into a course is really difficult and I have not seen anyone strike that balance like Prof. Siegel.

But this course gives a huge foundation in general application of ML. I'm not especially interested in working in a business environment per se, but this course really teaches you how to fluently talk about the non-technical aspects of ML and data science. The unit on ethics I think is particularly important. The software demos are also really helpful whether or not you plan to use SAS. Honestly this course was so well rounded. I really enjoyed Eric Siegel's presentation. He manages to be extremely funny while also really effectively teaching the material. My only criticism is he tried way too hard to sell his book at every opportunity and there were not many readings that weren't written by him. And when reading the articles I noticed that he'd used the exact same wording in the course videos. So a little more diversity there could be good.",0,2,Catherine Taft,42972738

I’ve been studying ML on other Online courses for over a year now (focusing on the math and programming aspects), so this course turned out to be a great complement to all the other technical courses I’ve been doing. Furthermore, whereas the other courses followed a more traditional school setting (e.g. power point slides, thousands of mathematical formulas) this course was such a nice surprise as it is quite dynamic, light and with a touch of humor.This course is not meant for learning the math or programming; there are many other courses online with that purpose. (If you want to implement what Eric has shown in this course on your own, you will need to learn: Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability & Statistics and a programming language, such as R or python before trying to implement ML models). This course though, should also be taken by people like me who are trying to learn the technical aspects of ML. The many examples in the course help construct a thorough understanding as well as provide a framework to participate in ML meetings. I do intend to recommend this course to a few managers of my company for them to understand what my team is trying to achieve.
