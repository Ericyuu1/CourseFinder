16070541~COURSE!~58H3s7ZHEeW2iwpbOuagWQ,1587403677493,1,0,"This course is horrible.  Much of the content is out-of-date.  For example, the professor names numerous companies in this video that are working on 3D printing, but some went out-of-business three years ago or are completely irrelevant now due to the rapid maturation of the technology.  The worst part of this course is the grading system.  I work hard and conduct plenty of research to ensure that I submit thorough answers to my classmates in accordance with the instructor's guidelines.  In return I get classmates who barely speak English that knock down my grades because that don't care and/or don't understand my response.  I'm getting punished for working hard.  These classmates are the same ones that give non-sense answers to class discussion, post answers like ""Hiii"" to a serious question, and make the course seem like a joke overall.  With outdated material and classmates who are a joke and grade unfairly, I have no issue un-enrolling ASAP (I'm about to!).  I would never pay ANY money to get a certificate from this University and this professor, and I feel like this has been a complete waste of my time.  I seriously doubt I will give any attention to Coursera in the future.  ",0,5,Dan,16070541

While this conveys the benefit of being able to listen to some of the videos without consistently watching, the interview questions asked of speakers are sometimes printed on the screen and not asked verbally.  If you're not watching, you miss the questions.  I would like to see this course refocused on design thinking for 3D printing, with other applications interspersed as examples rather than constituting the lion's share of the course.  I believe that format would both be more engaging and do a better job of delivering skills with more opportunity for practice.",0,1,Liam Holton,19104574

11432960~COURSE!~58H3s7ZHEeW2iwpbOuagWQ,1480702600072,3,0,I'll start by saying that this course gives a good insight into a wide variety of applications of 3D printing. There are lots of interviews with people who have or are leveraging additive manufacturing in original and effective ways. The last week of the course also introduces an interesting and seemingly effective framework for design thinking. The reason that I've only rated 3 stars however is that the only useful thing you learn in this course is the design thinking framework. I think that it would be better if these videos were scattered throughout the rest of the specialisation. I do see value in including this material in the specialisation but not as an outright course.,0,0,Ethan Ramsay,11432960
