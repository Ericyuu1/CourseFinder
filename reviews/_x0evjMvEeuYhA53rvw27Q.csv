47891291~COURSE!~_x0evjMvEeuYhA53rvw27Q,1664386150818,4,0,"5​ star for the content of the lessons, by the stellar Scarlet Keys.
S​he will help you raise your game in making your music express the emotions you wanted to convey.
Note: the videos from this course are available for free on Berklee's YT channel, so if you don't need the certificate...Minus 1 star for the outdated and clumsy user experience from Coursera: impractical, difficult to navigate and confusing. The peer-rating system is particularly bad. Time to completely rethink it.",0,1,Sylvain L,47891291

2131055~COURSE!~_x0evjMvEeuYhA53rvw27Q,1672292469124,5,0,Great course. You'll learn about which chords and melodies - along with the lyrics - invoke specific emotions. I would say that the only downside is that it's more geared toward piano/keyboard players instead of other instruments. An understanding of basic music theory is a good idea before starting this course.,0,0,Ian L. Malcolm,2131055

75622448~COURSE!~_x0evjMvEeuYhA53rvw27Q,1658731624454,5,0,"This was such a wonderful course. I had taken music theory in college and had the classical training, but this course is exactly what I wanted to learn beyond what I was taught. Scarlet does such a great job conveying the emotions that are associated with certain chords and chord progressions and really breaks down what you need to create prosody in music. It is challenging, but in the best way possible.",0,1,Paula Propst,75622448
