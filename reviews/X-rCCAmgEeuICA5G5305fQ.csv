9447702~COURSE!~X-rCCAmgEeuICA5G5305fQ,1670998041808,2,0,"I'm not sure why people are giving this class high praise. It has numerous errors and typos, which easily could have been fixed by anyone taking the time to proofread it before posting it online. I saw some incorrect answers for the quizzes, too. That is unacceptable. I can see some use to this course if there weren't so many issues, but because of them, I can only give the course two stars.",0,0,Dan Tinsley,9447702

Reading material often way too difficult for novices and those not already familiar with many software programming  terms (especially the callbacks material). But ignore it and do the exercise anyway which is simple enough.",0,0,DENT CHRIS,100965757
