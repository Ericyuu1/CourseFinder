4830300~COURSE!~Mc6aqWY3Eeu_Hw4i_leFQw,1668412149783,2,0,Might be useful as an introduction I guess.   Helpful to get  basic definitions of various terms.  As mentioned by other reviewers the course just comprises of lists of definitions of commonly used terms. Quizs are poorly designed and don't really test anything.Can probably complete this entire  course in around an hour.,0,0,Dan Wong,4830300
84492865~COURSE!~Mc6aqWY3Eeu_Hw4i_leFQw,1659486711954,2,0,"The Good: content is clear concise, and straight to the pointThe Bad: there is virtually 0 practical application of any sort other than the occasional discussion forum. No actual technical platform where you can apply data warehousing technique. Overall I would classify this course as well as the two other associated courses in this specialization as a glorified dictionary.   ",0,2,Hany Soliman,84492865
