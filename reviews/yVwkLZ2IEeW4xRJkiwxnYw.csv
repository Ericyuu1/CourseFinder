60803876~COURSE!~yVwkLZ2IEeW4xRJkiwxnYw,1592723846479,3,0,Of course one of the downsides of this course is that it was produced several years ago. That said attending to some of the course material through a Covid-19 lens can be part of the learning experience. I think using Japan as a central case study was a good one but sometimes the lessons to be learnt for other countries were not made explicit. In a sense the information about Japanese health policy and the Japanese health system can also be used things to aspire to.  ,0,0,David Marc van Reyk,60803876

My realisations are as follows.  On the community level, health is a metric of one's social integrity,i.e., health indicates person's ability to balance individual and collective rights and responsibilities. On the economic level, health is a business. It involves trade or exchange of both material and immaterial (i.e., rights, personal freedoms, beliefs, emotions, ideas etc.) resources between individuals (or groups) who are capable of mutual (healthy) life support.

The three professors who teach this course are truly experts in their field and have a wealth of knowledge on these topics, and hearing their thoughts on these contemporary issues was refreshing. In fact, a lot of the literature relevant to this course is authored by these very same professors, so the expertise is definitely there.
