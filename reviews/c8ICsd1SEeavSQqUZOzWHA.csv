My only reason for not giving five stars is that the time estimates for most weeks were significantly under what I spent - particularly on readings and the week 7 assignment.

Also, the economic approach to thinking about land degradation was a helpful insight. I would have liked to see more technical background. The work load is exactly right. I did have some technical problems with the last graded assignment though, causing me to lose two hours of work and having to start over. I would have also liked to see more multiple choice progress exams throughout the course. This will help learners keep on track an put in the work every week. ",0,1,Annewil Hooijer,2465322

Eu sou um profissional na área de Restauração Florestal e do curso eu experimentei muitas novas idéias e conceitos com os objetivos dos 4 retornos.
