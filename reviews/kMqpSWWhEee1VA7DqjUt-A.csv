52396838~COURSE!~kMqpSWWhEee1VA7DqjUt-A,1613577867607,5,0,Best Course ever. Learned so much! ,0,0,Stella Steffens,52396838
57934492~COURSE!~kMqpSWWhEee1VA7DqjUt-A,1608753988790,5,0,"I spent a lot time from conceptual to learn kinematics, dynamics, controls, and so on to learn and enhance my knowledge, I am so appreciate.",0,0,Steven Feng,57934492
47948228~COURSE!~kMqpSWWhEee1VA7DqjUt-A,1606854764879,5,0,A really amazing and exhaustive course. Covers everything you need to know about robotics especially from a Mechanical Engineering point of view.,0,1,Huzefa Lightwala,47948228
237372~COURSE!~kMqpSWWhEee1VA7DqjUt-A,1601727254848,5,0,"I found this course to be very stimulating. It's nice to see how everything comes together in a project. It would be great to have done it on real hardware and perhaps in the future this could be done without it resulting in something to expensive. But the overall feeling is that it is well designed, well documented, challenging and rewarding.",0,0,Juan Carlos Córdova Zeceña,237372
44916792~COURSE!~kMqpSWWhEee1VA7DqjUt-A,1591446831526,5,0,I really loved this course. Now forums are slightly active. You get a response from learners. If you are stuck don't give up keep trying you will be able to complete the project.,0,0,Shubham Takbhate,44916792
2236389~COURSE!~kMqpSWWhEee1VA7DqjUt-A,1589726793143,5,0,Probably the best specialization I've done so far. I wish there were more programs like this!,0,2,Juan Carlos De Sousa,2236389
56342~COURSE!~kMqpSWWhEee1VA7DqjUt-A,1580440217406,5,0,Capstone Project taught me the most. Thank you for the great course. Would you have a advanced robotics course? I would love to take that too.,0,3,Sunil Nandihalli,56342
46430434~COURSE!~kMqpSWWhEee1VA7DqjUt-A,1572863156718,5,0,Excellent lecture to study mobile manipulator including great example.,0,1,Wookyong Kwon,46430434
41961871~COURSE!~kMqpSWWhEee1VA7DqjUt-A,1567957006764,5,0,It was fascinating implementing what I learnt in the previous five courses into a real-life scenario. ,0,0,Hrushi K,41961871
41434911~COURSE!~kMqpSWWhEee1VA7DqjUt-A,1565968181630,5,0,Builds on the knowledge from the previous 5 courses in a fun and moderately challenging project. Uses a mobile manipulator robot which is great because it applies both chain and wheeled robotics. I recommend you have some programming experience for the capstone but if you completed the previous courses this one should be fine. ,0,2,Moussa,41434911
36678873~COURSE!~kMqpSWWhEee1VA7DqjUt-A,1558963134949,5,0,"Loved the final project. While the first half of it will be a breeze for anyone, the challenge begins in the latter half. Learned a lot through the debugging process. The extra part of making a joint limit tester was also fun. Although if an alternative project or a separate course could be provided to practically employ these theories by making a robot then that will be even better. ",0,6,Arnab Chatterjee,36678873
104073~COURSE!~kMqpSWWhEee1VA7DqjUt-A,1549587300768,5,0,"This capstone is adequately challenging, realistic and exposes the students to the real problems which arise when one tries to program a robot. I used almost all the knowledge that I gained through previous 5 courses. And there is plenty of room for creativity and beyond-minimum challenge.",0,2,Irina Reshodko,104073
