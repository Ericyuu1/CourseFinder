I could do that with other courses. Why isnt there a download button for backing tracks that are required for the course? the content is great but the course interface is so poorly designed. I cant uplad projects due to issues with soundcloud and vimeo, so I cant finish this course. I shouldnt have to rely on third party sites and software to submit homework and projects.",0,0,keenan daulton,96295025
73937118~COURSE!~QrEOzJVVEeqiqQqc4u2XIw,1604792809851,4,0,When I was at Berklee I never studied with Rick (he was assistant chair at the time) but I did do a proficiency once with him and Garrison Fewell (probably two of the most ruthless people do attempt that with!).  This is a wonderful course for the most part. The chapter on power chords is pretty useless and I can't imagine Rick would have even wanted to include it. I would have rather had more chord studies. Aside from that a great class that is really fun. Beginners may have trouble with this one. ,0,1,Noah Vincelette,73937118

I don't know if it's a copyright issue or what, but I could record a much better quality product on my final assignments if you would let me download the backing tracks. If this is already an option, then you need to explicitly explain how to do so.",0,0,Bryan Blanchard,59782807

I liked the way Rick explained the 1,3,5,7. using the cards. For me it was a very difficult for that to sink in and I don't think I would have grasped it without the cards.
