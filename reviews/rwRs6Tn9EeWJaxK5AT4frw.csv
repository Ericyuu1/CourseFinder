Instructors refuse to grade Capstone assignment so I can get the certificate even though it is done correctly. It appears University of Michigan is using instructors who don't read the assignment instructions or who do not understand what they are grading. Awful experience. Only way to contact is through message board and the reply time is several days. I would have given a lower rating if I could.

92435797~COURSE!~rwRs6Tn9EeWJaxK5AT4frw,1666734206570,1,0,"A​ very disfunctional and disappointing finish to the specialization.  The first 3 courses built off of each other and the textbook provided additional explanation for topics.  Moreover, there were exercises at the end of every chapter to test the learner's knowledge.  Overall, the first three courses were heavily hands-on where we learned to write out own code.  C​ontrasting this, course 4, and course 5 (captsone) were very different.  Important topics and new knowledge was glossed over very quickly, and the difficulty of the programs increased significantly more than the level of the students' current knowledge.  The programs were actually so difficult compared to our skill level that assignments started to involve simply copy and pasting pre-written code, making slight changes, running, and screenshotting output.  Gone were the days of writing out own code apparently...This is no way to learn.  T​he captsone...WOW.  Basically the previous paragraph but even worse.  Same logic, copy code, run it, take screenshots, submit.  Apparently coursera and University of Michigan think that this constitutes knowing how to code.  Given that the specialization capstone is advertized as something that we will upload to our portfolio, it is concerning that UMICH thinks that this is appropriate.  No employer will hire you simply because you have the certificate, or an application in your portfolio that you merely copy and pasted without knowing how it works.  Not only this, but I was actually automatically unsubscribed from the capstone because I finished the week 1 quiz and coursera gave me my certificate before I had even begun the capstone project.  The fine print that I failed to realize was that all you have to complete to get the certificate is to complete the quiz, the rest of the course, the ""Honours Track"" is optional.  What I did not realize was that it was one or the other...I was under the impression that I could complete the quiz and upgrade to the honors certificate after completing the rest of the course, I was wrong.O​verall, the first three courses I learned a lot and felt confident in my abilities, but the last two courses progressively got worse.

To check if the data is in the database table, you select some of them with setting limit, you don't always query entire table.  It's good practice.

They were like 5 times longer and more complex. It took me days to figure out a few lines of codes but eventually you no need to understand any of it, just run it.The improvement for the course would be bringing the codes difficulty down and let us actually edit them for the assignments.",0,0,maytat luangprasert,41890693

26778344~COURSE!~rwRs6Tn9EeWJaxK5AT4frw,1582682767888,2,0,"I am extremely disappointed with how this class was setup.  Basically, you had to do next to nothing to earn the certificate for this class.  There is a single 26 question quiz (taken in week 1) that just covers basic Python information from the previous 4 classes in the specialization. There's no class videos or assignments other than the single quiz to gain the class certificate. The question set was not challenging and it didn't deal with much of the detailed concepts that were presented and learned in the previous 4 classes.  What is the point of doing this???  Now this class is a 7 week class and there is a separate optional honors program (with a note on your final certificate saying that you completed the honors content) that requires the completion of 3 additional peer-graded assignments.  There are some videos covering a little new material and some reading but no quizzes.  I really don't get it.  What makes a fellow student, learning this material like me, capable of fairly assessing my work on larger scale programs that should be part of a capstone course?  And what makes me capable of assessing the work of others fairly?  Obviously, I'm not a big fan of the peer-grading concept, I feel it is just an excuse for the course creators to excuse themselves from grading which is an important component for learners.  I've completed the class and got my certificate and the certificate for finishing the Python for Everybody specialization.  But I really don't feel all that good about this since I was required to learn nothing new nor complete any capstone work to receive the certificates. For my own well being (and to help me with future Python work), I'm in the process of finishing all of the honors work now so at least I'll have gained something from this class.There is also a push by the class creators to pressure students into working together and that's the reasoning they've given for leaving this class so open-ended.  I get that (and agree there is some importance to that concept) but this is supposed to be a capstone class, where you put many of the aspects of your previous learning to work on some more real-world problems.  And to get some guidance on how best to apply your new skills to real problems.  How can you get the class certificate without doing that?  I feel all of the optional honors content should be mandatory and the class structure (quizzes & assignments) should be similar to the other 4 classes in the certificate program.  Make sure the students you graduate are ready for the work that lies ahead.  You wouldn't want it any different if you were the student.I also feel this setup diminishes the value of this class and the associated specialization certification because students are required to do next to nothing in this last class (which should be a milestone and help lock in all we've been exposed to throughout the first 4 classes).  So when possible employers see that you've completed this specialization, there's got to be a question whether you actually did any capstone work and put some programs together using all of the skills learned. In my opinion, the capstone work is a very important part of your completed specialization and should be a required component for everyone who completes the specialization.",0,17,Christopher Lyons,26778344

Before my enrollment, I was deeply impressed by the fact that you're so courteous and generous to allow everybody to use your precious teaching materials (books, slides, videos, etc.) for no charge. I thought to myself, ""Not so many people do this these days, who is this guy??"". After watching the first video, I could not stop ever since. Your presentations are outstanding and quite engaging. Your sense of humor is amazing. The effort that you put into your slides never went unnoticed. The writing style of your Python book is very nice. Everything you say or write shows how passionate you are about your work. But, what is even more impressing is the amount of time and effort that you give for no charge to help others. Obviously, you could have made thousands of dollars if you used your time and efforts otherwise, but, fortunately, you chose another route, which, in fact, pays off in the long run. Probably, you did not get as much money as you deserve, but you helped many thousands of people who needed help and made them so much grateful to you.

This course is pretty good and Dr. Chuck's teaching style is a plus as always. But there were a few reasons why I was a little less enthusiastic than the previous courses of this specialization. For this capstone, the videos aren't all that helpful when the assignments require few changes to the scripts that are readily available. The most I learned was when I was working on a project or question that I was interested in. If I got stuck, then I would then go back and watch the videos in closer detail where I got stuck and/or code in the examples. That would solidify the lessons a little bit more in my head. The quiz format in the earlier courses was great but it wasn't included here, partly because of the format. What could be done in the capstone is to have snippets of code that are missing then ask us to fill it in. Alternatively, you can have different snippets of code and ask us which is correct to properly execute a section. In addition, I thought we would get to present our coding work on the project of interest, even if it was just optional.

Of course, doing so deprives you of the level ups and treasure you would've obtained going through it, and you'll find yourself unprepared for the future if you skip the dungeon.This class works the same. If you just want to complete it, all you have to do is start it up, do an easy final exam for the specialization, and there you go.  Of course, you'll miss out on all the skills you'll learn from doing the capstone project and the project for your portfolio (which you NEED if you're thinking about getting a job in the industry.)Who would've thought a dungeon from a relatively unknown Game Boy RPG could serve as the template for a class on Coursera?",0,0,Dan S,981718

I really appreciate Dr Chuck's instruction and dedication to students. I'm auditing the classes because I cannot work right now. However, I'm amazed at how much I've learned from using Terminal, to building databases, to using frameworks like regex, urllib, & bs4, to building visualizations using email depots - using word clouds and line graphs. Who would have thought that all of that could be explained so well?I must say that I did have to watch some videos repeatedly and build my own code along side, to understand the material. To really know the material, I do feel that building alongside Dr Chuck, and then creating your own stuff, is probably the best way to get the full worth of the knowledge. And I still have to build up my GMANE example...so more work to be done. But I'm done with the videos, and they were all excellent!I started Harvard's CS50w in the hopes that I could finish that and build my own web applications, but the backbone for taking that course is that you know Python already (and HTTP, HTML, CSS and Javascript). This sequence of Python classes is EXCELLENT. I've tried many other python classes, but never really got it. Dr Chuck explains everything so well that I understood everything this time.I've also watched the History of the Internet class (all at high speed playback). That too is BRILLIANT!Thank you, thank you, thank you.",0,0,Shim G,33474163
