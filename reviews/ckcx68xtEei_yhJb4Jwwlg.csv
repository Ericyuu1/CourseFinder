It has a lack of information, the material was just going around of the idea that the world is full of information and how technology is damaging the classical process of journalism. I did not learn how is the real process in agencies to create the content and manage it. The additional material was just reinforcing the same idea of how technology has changed people's perceptions and this material was not enough to open up some definitions to expand research.

Instead the professor speaks broadly about intangible concepts and the general way of ""how things should be done"".

34994212~COURSE!~ckcx68xtEei_yhJb4Jwwlg,1607938568344,3,0,"This course looks at content marketing from one angle: a journalistic approach and very superficially. The marketing approach is not considered at all. It would be good to reflect this feature in the course name. For the first two weeks, the lecturer talks only about global issues in journalism and nothing about marketing. The course is poorly organized - students do not understand what and how to complete the task. Out of 6 of my colleagues ' works that I checked, 5 failed to complete the task. Only one student understood the subject. But I think that this is not the merit of the author / lecturer, but the previous experience of the student. For General development, you can take this course. For professional purposes, I recommend looking for something else.",0,3,Elena Stroganova,34994212

6397620~COURSE!~ckcx68xtEei_yhJb4Jwwlg,1597611750123,3,0,"Well, it was interesting. I wanted to take this specialization because I do create content for a living. So, I am thinking perhaps the course was just not right for me, maybe its because I'm a visual person and I can create strategies, as long as they are visual.Also, you should consider modifying the assignments. Since the more important assignments are peer-reviewed it gets deeply disappointing, as you do not get a guideline of how it is going to be graded, but you get one of how you should give the grade. So, I think the exams should have a higher percentage of the final grade than peer-reviewed assignments.Overall because we are students, and just follow guidelines. We do not fully understand everything as deeply as the teachers do. So, if everything does not look perfect there, we simply cannot assign a grade. This happened during both courses I took, not only this one.Moreover, many students do not even bother in reading the assignment, they just like it or don't like it and then, the grade relies too much on how lucky we get with the person who has to review our work and if they empathize or not with what we are writing and the topic we shared.Lastly, the language barrier, it was harder to understand, write and express my ideas and thoughts in English that I anticipated :) ",0,7,Drea Duque,6397620
