49235471~COURSE!~EI-82zazEeaU3A4B1dNclw,1583188622287,4,0,"very good course and a good complement to the first course. I personally regret that the assignment description are a bit fuzzy and hard to understand for a non native english (lot of words i don't know) and not knowing chinese history too. But still happy to have followed these 2 courses, many thanks to the teachers",0,0,GUILLAUME POVEDA,49235471

The assignments and workshops are very challenging (especially if you're new to MiniZinc). Finally, the fable used make the videos very engaging. ",0,0,Gabriel Max De Mendonça Abrantes,37259330

You will need patience and time to perform quite a bit of trial-and-error programming in an environment that is still developing and needs further refinment. In 10 years, will there be an Eclipse-style IDE for solvers that could be profitably used even in high school? Why not!",0,0,David Tonhofer,21347849

964373~COURSE!~EI-82zazEeaU3A4B1dNclw,1537860029213,5,0,"Great course for those who would like to divert from procedural and object-oriented programming and challenge themselves. The course promotes developing holistic thinking in discrete optimization, as solving most assignments to full grade usually requires developing some really good “global constraints” (these beasts have already appeared in the “Basic Modeling for Discrete Optimization” course). Although the fable based learning approach may frustrate some academic snobs, I guess it is generally fun and does not hinder the essence of the course. Highly recommended.",0,0,Alex Dainiak,964373
