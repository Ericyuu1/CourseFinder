I am Chinese and I have been working and living in XinJiang for quite some time, the bias example used in the course is nothing real according to my life experience, if you do have evidence , please provide them, or better if you come to China and take a look yourself. if the evidence is come from sth like CNN or BBC, then I can only laugh at it, and will have to categorize this course same level with CNN and BBC news.",0,1,Shuhan Ma,82208381

4726435~COURSE!~7qeLDpoGEeqxkg6qj38ihw,1632663064009,5,0,"As a non technical person (ex banker) I have been struggling to understand ML and the series of courses conducted by Eric Siegel seems to be made just for us non-technical types. I found the subject matter very easy to understand and grasp allowing me to now think about the possible applications. Eric has also a section where he discusses real world applications of ML. This is a key differentiator from another course on ML I had attended and we are now in a position to communicate confidently with people offering data science / ML expertise. Working on applications would require team effort and the composition of an ideal team is also discussed as a feature of the course which I found invaluable and another differentiator. Given the serious subject matter, I am appreciative of the effort put in by Eric to also ensure there are lighthearted moments along the way. Overall I found this course an outstanding program backed by SAS and would recommend it as compulsory attendance for those who want to understand the wide implications of ML in every aspect of our lives today and in the future. I am happy to embrace this technology without fear. Thank you. ",0,1,T Brahm (Tobram),4726435

Highly recommend this specialization.  For business leaders, it will help drive the business impact of ML initiatives and manage ethical pitfalls. For technology experts, it does a great job at setting context and painting a great picture of potential applications of ML before one would dive deep into the algorithms.",0,0,Jay Shah,47184814

35362450~COURSE!~7qeLDpoGEeqxkg6qj38ihw,1614795888661,5,0,"This is increasingly essential knowledge for both business leaders who know that data must be tapped for competitive advantage and analytics professionals who need to understand how to help businesses tap that power.  Each party needs to know a bit more - not too much, but enough - about the other's world to be effective together and deliver results.  Finding that balance of how much tech and data and how much business outcome to put into a course is really difficult and I have not seen anyone strike that balance like Prof. Siegel.  In addition to this unique capability Prof. Siegel brings relevant and relatable cases, actual hands on work in an approachable format and keen sense of humor as he lets geek flag fly high.
