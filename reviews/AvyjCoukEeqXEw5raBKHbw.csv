There's additional reading from pytorch manual. BERT and you can google the concept yourself, so it's not like it's impossible to understand, but you need to spend significant more time to do your reading.T​he project and the way he doing this project is pretty good.

I found myself having to pause the video a lot to look up code syntax lest it becomes a typing exercise. The Rhyme platform for assignments is nice in concept (side by side notebooks) but is barely usable in practice. Typing was laggy and it won't allow cut and paste which is really silly given how much code is over copied to be modified (e.g. train vs validation).
