9447702~COURSE!~O9EHBwrcEeyuQw4FWEXW4w,1674957429261,2,0,"This was not a well-done course. The videos were okay, for the most part, but the class is mostly just theory. There is no hands-on at all. It starts off by wanting students to install Security Onion, but it's never used in the entire course, so it's pointless to waste time and energy installing it, unless the person plans on learning more about it after the course on their own time. What really brings the course down for me, though, is how poorly done the quizzes are. They have numerous writing issues, such as misspelled words, bad grammar, and bad writing mechanics. I can tell that they were written by someone whose first language isn't English, and no one bothered to proofread them to make sure that they were written correctly. In addition, there were at least two questions where the correct answers weren't accepted. Maybe this course is better on the EC-Council's website, but here on Coursera, it's virtually useless.",0,0,Dan Tinsley,9447702
