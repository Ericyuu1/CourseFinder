42161716~COURSE!~CCsFDJSbEeq3exJVY3IqDw,1652267879385,1,0,Extremly poor course! Candidates are facing problems in the code chunks given and there is no response from the moderator/teacher.My suggestion will be to delete this course if the moderator is not able to answer the queries. Taking money from the candidates and providing no response to their questions is nothing short of robbery!,0,4,Aviparna Biswas,42161716

73606746~COURSE!~CCsFDJSbEeq3exJVY3IqDw,1603039314498,3,0,"Overall, this course provides a good overview of the power and possibilities of R and Tableau. If you are not currently comfortable working with R, I wouldn't recommend this class. I wish the class had a specific research question -- a lot of the cleaning in R felt arbitrary without know what our end goal was. Note that you'll need to sign up for a free trial of Tableau -- that wasn't clear at the beginning of the course.",0,1,Carey Dunfey,73606746
