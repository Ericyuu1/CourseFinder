Voici quelques point qui pourraient améliorer le cours; -Vidéos plus long avec plus de matière-Revoir les liens afin que tous les documents, vidéos, articles soient toujours accessible-Plus de clarté à savoir la portée du choix de l'acteur initialement-Possibilité de faire un 'course pack' qui inclut les articles de lectures suggérés (quitte à payer le cours plus cher initialement. Le choix de prendre des articles spécifiques n'est pas toujours offert, s'abonner à un journal en entier pour la lecture d'un seul article n'est pas pertinent).",0,1,Jean-Sébastien Rondeau-Bonin,53120365
