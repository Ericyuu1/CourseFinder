I do not recommend this course to anyone below a B2 level in French. I received my graduate degree from Sciences Po and I love the quality of education I received. But without overcoming the innate French disabilitiy to realize that most people out there don't speak French and that there's no use in making a course where SOME elements are translated, this institution will never become truly international.

First, this course is advertised as English but majority of the material is French with English subtitles. Subtitles are fine, but the problem with this material is that not all things are translated - so the speakers are translated but the diagrams/charts/powerpoint slides are all in French. I am fine with using a right-click on chrome for google translation, but this does not work for the pictures which contain French text.Also, the material, while very interesting, is very outdated. I don't know when this course was designed, but most of the material's diagrams and statistics are from 2012-2014. They project how perceptions of Europe might be for the future, but the ""future"" for this course is 2016, which is 4 years ago now. I don't think it it fair to pay for a course where the facts and figures don't even hold validity while I am taking it. I wanted to learn about the geopolitics of Europe today, not the geopolitics of Europe from 2014. I think there is a major gap of important material here.Overall, the course material was interesting, but definitely not what I was hoping for. I don't feel I have learned much either because the assessments are quizzes between 4-6 questions that you could answer if you just googled them. I wish the instructors would update the course and then it would be more valuable. ",0,13,Angela DaSilva,42346461
