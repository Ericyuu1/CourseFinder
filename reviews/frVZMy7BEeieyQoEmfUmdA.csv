108567456~COURSE!~frVZMy7BEeieyQoEmfUmdA,1665418169492,1,0,"C​ompleted the first four weeks of the course with no issue. Found the content interesting and engaging. In week 5, learners are asked to download a program called VMware for future assignments/examples. Followed the link, took me to a website riddled with pop up ads that looked highly distrustful. Downloaded the required program and when I ran it, the program caused an instillation error and I couldn't get it off my device. The only way to remove the program from your device is through that program's launcher.  In my attempt to remove the program with the launcher, it deleted OS programs and caused my full OS to corrupt. Spoke to an IT friend of mine who suggested doing a full scrub of the machine to factory new. Went through with him to do this, and 7 hours later it finalizes, screen full glitches out, and now the computer is full dead and will not so much as turn on even when plugged in. Main takeaway: it doesn't matter how good a course's material is when it destroys your entire computer. Would highly suggest staying away from the program.",0,0,Jacob Harries,108567456

The material focuses on preparing you with relevant knowledge about database systems (past and present), that supports you in the next courses of the specialization which are more hands-on with coding in SQL-dialects. Initially I did not feel convinced I wanted or needed to understand much database theory covered in this course, and wanted to skip to the hands-on practice. However I've completely changed my mind after completing the course which has drastically improved my understanding of all current big data-base systems, their features, pros/cons, why there are so many variations, and helped me understand which database systems I want to focus learning on next. Unlike googling/studying myself online, I can actually be sure that the information given in this course is relevant and up to date. I highly recommend it, especially to anyone who hasn't had much working experience with databases yet- you'll gain a much better understanding of the current landscape of database technology.
