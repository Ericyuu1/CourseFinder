117223784~COURSE!~zmLU1xzCEe2yDw48xzb9Sw,1669984004929,2,0,"Though the information you learn is valuable, the grading system is not. Having peers grade you from all around the world does not seem fair when some of them are not taking this course seriously. I had feedback such as ""no"" with no explanation of how I could improve on an assignment I was genuinely confused about. I ended up failing that assignment and had to wait a week to be regraded on my new submission. The set up for the assignments is a little confusing at times and the ""templates"" can be used by anyone. So sometimes the data gets altered. It was easy and convenient, this class, so that's why I gave it any stars. ",0,0,Natasha Orzel,117223784

Additionally, I believe that the slide presentation templates they offer have some room for improvement when it comes to clearly and concisely conveying information. I would recommend this course for anyone (like me) who wants to learn more about what it's like to be a sustainability analyst, but I would not get overly caught up in the assignments.",0,0,Kyle Combes,2022357
