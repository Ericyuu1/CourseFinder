This is the first time I've used the Coursera Project format, and I've found that it's a great environment to a first, practical introduction to a very specific topic. Yes, this is a very basic introduction, you will not have theoretical lessons about Spark and its functionalities, but you'll dive right in Pyspark and write commands on a dataset. Projects are done in the Google Colab platform, so that the code you did will be available on your profile even after the course ended. ",0,0,Silvia Gloria Tamburini,114549325
