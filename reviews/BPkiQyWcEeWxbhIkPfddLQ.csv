Despite the fact that the lectures were not particularly long, nor the assignments really onerous, I think I learned more in this course than in other similar courses.  Perhaps it was because there were so many ""aha!"" moments, as I realized why my previous attempts to combine typefaces had not been so successful, or exactly what it was that attracted me (or not) to the appearance of a particular type family.The story is that Steve Jobs was captivated by typography in the days when the text on the screen did not look at all like the text that would print -- people had to use codes for even simple things like bold-face or underline, and wouldn't know what it looked like until it printed on their single-typeface printer.  He fell in love with type, and that contributed a lot to the way the Macintosh developed.  I never understood that story until I took this course.Thank you for a great course, and for giving me enough knowledge that I can continue to build on it. ",0,2,Sister Edith Bogue,498061
