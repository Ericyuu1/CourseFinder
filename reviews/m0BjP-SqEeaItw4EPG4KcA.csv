30144610~COURSE!~m0BjP-SqEeaItw4EPG4KcA,1548867754819,2,0,Interesting course but the way the course is supported and course work is being assessed needs major reconsideration. ,0,3,Clemens Rumpf,30144610
19793571~COURSE!~m0BjP-SqEeaItw4EPG4KcA,1599731838601,3,0,"Though the learning content itself is great, there is NO support from the instructors,mentors and TAs. Some quizes have wrong data given; despite all this, due to the student community the course is still doable and enjoyable.",0,1,M Venkata Akhil,19793571
49710701~COURSE!~m0BjP-SqEeaItw4EPG4KcA,1588448000935,3,0,"Bad maintenance of the questionnaires, that in too many cases exhibit questions to be answered with a magic number yielded by a simulation, that happens to be invalid even though the simulation runs perfectly. With no indications about integration intervals or stuff like that, basing the correctness of the answer on the resolution of an unknown number is too much of a lucky issue.I find a real lack of maintenance effort in the several assignments and questionnaires. Moreover, assignments keep unchanged for years, what reduces uniqueness to the questions and allow the pupils to find the answers across the historic of the discussions.Having said that, I must admit that the course is rather interesting and professor Mr. Schaub is absolutely, completely superb!!!!!But please, please, please, if you don't want to mess up an otherwise super interesting course, review the questions and assignments.",0,2,Jose Felipe Gonzalez,49710701
12131324~COURSE!~m0BjP-SqEeaItw4EPG4KcA,1572430086498,4,0,"The course content is good and the quizzes are relevant. I really learned a lot from this course.However the numerical quizzes requiring simulation are often badly explained, and many times, small details that are not mentioned in the course material will result in a wrong answer. In some questions, the right answer is outright wrong given the information in the question.The course relies a lot on the discussion forum in these cases, however the teaching assistance is non-existant and the low number of active students enrolled simultaneously makes its usefulness limited for debugging.For the sake of its contents, I really recommend this course, however the quizzes require some major rework for an entirely satisfactory learning experience.",0,5,Gustav Lundin,12131324

5294424~COURSE!~m0BjP-SqEeaItw4EPG4KcA,1515193844698,5,0,"Thank prof. Schaub for very high quality course. By passing this course, I better understand kind of stabilities. This course  provides basis technic for defining nonlinear control law base on Lyapunov function. This course also introduces some practical aspects such as: non linear integrator for dealing with dynamics uncertainty, gain tuning and how to dealing with actuator saturation.

10267357~COURSE!~m0BjP-SqEeaItw4EPG4KcA,1496959044547,5,0,"Congratulations!!!
 An excellent well structured and advanced high level course. Themes like as General stability, Nonlinear stability, Langradge stability, Lyapunov stability, Asymptotic stability, Neighborhood are defined. Concept such as Lyapunov Stability Theory, Lyapunov functions, general elemental velocity Lyapunov function,  Lyapunov attitude control properties, control theory,  integral feedback, feedback gain, feedback control laws are analyzed, and compose  over all the course ""Control of Nonlinear Spacecraft Attitude Motion.",0,0,Michael Logothetis,10267357
