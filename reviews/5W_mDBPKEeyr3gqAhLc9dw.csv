Wait for your 2-3-4 opinion on the topic, the first opinion is generally not creative or surprising.2. To generate creative ideas, go into divergent thinking, where you think opposite of what you prefer.For example:You want to decide what to do before sleep:Then maybe I first think: Read a book. Going divergent would be, lets write something or write a story every night. Or Go out for cycling. Divergent would be: Call your relatives for some activity....like doing something on terrace. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I LEARNT/ ADMIRED WAS:
THEY GAVE 100% MARKS TO ME FOR ATTEMPTING THEIR FINAL EXERCISE, THIS MAYBE WAS BECAUSE I THINK THEY WANTED TO SAY THINKING CREATIVELY IS LIKE WALKING FORWARD AND NOT HOW FAR YOU HAVE WALKED. I THINK THAT WAS REALLY A GOOD LESSON",0,0,Harsh Khandelwal,96443899
