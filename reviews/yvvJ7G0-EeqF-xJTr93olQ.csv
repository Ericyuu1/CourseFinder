At the end of the day, no one (beginners or anyone else) should NOT have to go find code to make these offerings work correctly.  Overall, I really like what Coursera provides, but these tiny issues tarnish an otherwise positive experience.  Want more stars?  Fix the guided project to work correctly.  Incidentally, the presenter (""Mark"") was awesome!",0,0,Bruce Beck,100800053
