My expectations before the course (based on the first two courses in this specialization) were far better than what I actually got. I appreciate the efforts done on the course, but I am very sorry to say that watching some YouTube videos and reading practical articles on Investopedia will give anyone more understanding of portfolio allocation and risk management from a practical point of view than the pure theory presented here. I do not know if anybody reviewed the presented formulas or their explanation in week 4 from a leaner’s point of view: they suddenly exceed the whole gradual level of the specialization and do not present any practical value to a normal investor. The explanation of the efficient frontier was attractive, but again unpractical. Did the course teach me how to extract the  numbers from company data to calculate an efficient frontier of a possible real-life portfolio in order to determine the best allocation? Hardly ever. In conclusion, I do not recommend this course.",0,0,Mhd Firas Safadi,11978361

In this review I will focus on three main points of improvement: 1) Not deepening in Portfolio’s Risk formulas/calculations: lots were said about how correlation and (co)variance of individual assets can influence the whole portfolio’s risk. Though, It was not taught how to calculate the whole portfolio’s risk (ex.: how to do a variance-covariance matrix).2) Not applying what was taught in practical and holistic cases (considering multiple classes of assets and risk profile): I believe many of those who attended to this course want as output to conduct a Portfolio Optimization. Although we know all the concepts behind Modern Portfolio Theory’s and Diversification, none can apply it in an excel or to a given case. For that, I found a really interesting tutorial video from Dr. Colby Wright in YouTube that helped me on that. It was simple and would be a great conclusion if added to this course. 3) Debating Modern Portfolio Theory’s theoretical limitations, but not leading to new theories or more applicable one’s to surpass its limitations.I do know this course is one of a series of other courses in a Specialization. Maybe some of those points of improvement is answered in another course. I hope instructors might consider the course design and review the points in order to improve attendant’s learning, event if we do not attend the whole specialization.",0,5,Gabriel,334233
