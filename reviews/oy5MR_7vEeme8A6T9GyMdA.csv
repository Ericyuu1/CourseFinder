What could be improved:  The platform was not always easy to navigate, a few times I got logged out and could not log back in easily.   Some of the questions were not worded right  For example they said select three answers when there were only two, or it asked what are the two factors and then asked to select three.  As a person from an english speaking country, I didn't like that some of the videos were only in swedish with no subtitles.

Sharing Economy is the future of human socioeconomic development that will eventually reach every single community on the Earth. This is the very form of capitalistic Socialism, next-step Nordic model. Human beings are coming back to the ancient patterns of behaviour, but this time with new strength, highly advanced technologies, deep knowledge and great consciousness. You will be led trough really interesting living examples of Sharing Economy not only in Sweden, but also in Amsterdam, Berlin and Barcelona. I bet you will be surprised by the variety of possible solutions to connect citizens to each other with or without the help of government and business. What is more important, this approach is an essential measure in a way to saving our planet though the decrease of consumption, making our cities more sustainable, green and efficient, also with less harm to the environment.
