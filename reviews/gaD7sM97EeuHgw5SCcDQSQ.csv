The discussion staff are not helpful/don't understand or even read your questions before replying.  The labs don't always work and the instructions don't always line up with current software upgrades.  Just be prepared to do a lot of troubleshooting with not much help.  I wish the course would tell you what to do when certain errors occur/are more thorough with their instructions.   ,0,0,Mimi  Zheng,101327511

The labs were good, however the execution of the final assignment was poor -- you have to submit two dozen screen captures for a peer reviewed assignment.
