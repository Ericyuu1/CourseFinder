 parallels between problem-solving in humans and machines. The content is 
very thorough and relevant for both cognitive and computational 
students, researchers and professionals. However, there are some issues 
with quizzes and readings. Some of the quizzes questions are from other courses in the specialization, and some readings have broken links. Looking for help about these issues, I found that there are open discussions in the forums from over a year without any answer from course staff. This is concerning since people are paying for this, and also mind about their learning outcomes. Without support from staff for long lasting issues, learning can be compromised.",0,1,Gehazi Bispo,1235333
