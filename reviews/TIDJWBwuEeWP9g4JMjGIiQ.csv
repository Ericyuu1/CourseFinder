In a class that tells you to be an effective teacher, half of the learners leave unconstructive feedback like, ""You're wrong,"" without explaining what mistake they think you made.  The other half of learners leave negative feedback just because they disagree with your opinion, failing to grasp the concept of grading you based on the cohesiveness of the argument.  There are also a lot of non-native speakers of English ""correcting"" native speakers even though they are factually wrong on their ""correction,"" which they also give with a ridiculous amount of ignorant arrogance.

This is a certification course in how to teach English as a second language. What was not apparent to me though is that you have to take 2 parts of the specialization before getting certified and it will take over a year! Also, there is close to no teacher participation in the module I took and there are no mentors or student teachers (that might change in future classes I would hope, but no guarantees) and there was close to zero feedback of my work or even in the discussion area and no authoritative feedback. Even the peer reviews require your classmates ONLY to judge you based on whether you actually tried to answer the question, if it was between one and three paragraphs and one other silly thing that I can't even remember now. No one is required to give actual feedback and a lot of the assignments were written by students in horrendous English, but that is not to be considered. With so many people taking this course for whom English is not a first language, even these very simple instructions were often misunderstood and people had problems with getting credit for their assignments. Also, even though the videos are really well-done, they are short and contain little information for the price. I figured that I was paying about $50 an hour for the lectures at regular speed. There are also little to no resource links etc. for further study so the lectures are pretty much the only thing you get. If you are a native English speaker who doesn't mind spending an entire year and the cost for well-done videos on the subject is not important, then this course if for you. If however you think this is going to cost only $200 and you would have interaction with teachers and you would get a certification in about half a year... I want to make sure you realize, that is NOT what this specialization is! If you are NOT a native English speaker, this course is designed well I think for people who do not speak English as a native language, who might even have a low level of English, yet who are teaching English already in foreign countries and would have difficulty acquiring certification any other way and therefore don't mind taking a full year to complete the course or the price and for whom not having someone give them feedback would be considered an asset. I have recommended it to friends who are not native speakers of English, but as a native speaker I found it slow, expensive and the assignments to be actually annoying. It's perfect though for my foreigner friends... as long as they understand it's real length and cost! THE CERTIFICATION WILL TAKE OVER A YEAR AND COST AROUND $400. ",0,67,Dorothy H,16214925

That has to get properly referenced since it continues to be the most important vocabularly learning method as of today.   If it is taught later then that should be said.  If not, it has to get taught.  There is no emphazis that at first for a while vocabularly learning is part of school style language learning.  There is too much emphazise on being the fool and the clown for students.  That is over-done & over-dramatic.  Parents / students pay good money for language learning classes.  They want a sophisticated good teacher and not clowns & fools.  He also gives a wrong picture of the French language prof Francois Gouin who learnt German in Germany for one year without speaking to people.  Dr. Dixon portrays him as a loser.  The truth is that he successfully translated German literature during that year and then developed new language learning methods that continue to be foundational for all new language learning curriculum development around the world.   I just had the priviledge to experience that with a special  development of Hebrew Level A where I  became so proficient after 4 months that I was able to actively do research in Hebrew with the on-line environment.  These methods should be taught and not dismissed.  Some of the students only paraphrazed his wrong views about all of that in the assignments without having learnt the real achievements of this language professor.  In one exam, it gives a wrong when one marks text books for the on-line enviroment.  That was years ago when textbooks were not available on-line.  That has changed now.  There are a lot of text books on-line now.   Dr. Dixon puts language learning down at the beginning of this class and claims that only language acquisition is good.  In the summary, both presenters say that learning and acquisition must be balanced.  I agree with that.  That should be taught right from the beginning.   He leaves out language learning for translators, for ancient languages and for those who want to become language researchers.  They have to study far more structure, form and grammar for years.   Since this is a university level, things like that should be mentioned.  There is a lot of room in this class to add these things.  The lengthy film credits after each lecture are annoying and should be cut out.  One placement at the end of this class is sufficient and use that time for the above mentioned information.  I will research it myself in order to receive the correct information.  The candle diagram at the end of the class is really good.  I agree with that a language teacher is a candle and language is fire.  Be careful not to give out wrong information since it can burn one somewhere down the line since teaching language is a cake.  Dr. Dixon should make sure that he gets his cake receipe up-dated.   There are linguists around the world who know about these contributions of these two linguistic experts who have made siginificant contributions to language learning that continue to be highly valid and would look at him as a fool.

Basic principles laconically explained in high-quality videos by a very charismatic professional. Interesting and enlightening concepts helping to look at teaching from a different angle and enrich your own process of doing the job. Unfortunately, there are disadvantages to this too. For anybody whose English is C1 and higher this course will be a little undemanding. Weeks in the course consist of only several short videos and text lectures. But, as I have put it, this course is for beginners and, mostly, for foreigners whose goal is to teach English abroad and get a certificate as fast as possible. Another thing, probably the most crucial for me is lack of feedback from professional teachers regarding evaluation of essays. Your work is evaluated by your peers the majority of which are, firstly, not so well versed in English, making myriads of mistakes along the way without a second thought to correcting them, and, secondly, do not really care about the amount of work you put into your essays. It was quite common to see dry, simplistic ""Good."" comments without any proper critique.

Sure, there were some things which might be a little exclusively for language teaching, but I'd say, more, really, the things they explained were about teaching and learning in general.

The course material was engaging, and elicited a wide range of responses from me. I found, however, that the material was at times too simplistically presented. The complex and nuanced issues of teaching language could have been emphasized more fully. I very much enjoyed thinking about the issues the lessons raised, and very much enjoyed writing about those issues. I will say that the assignment guidelines were rather broad. For instance, writing one to four paragraphs strikes me as not being a meaningful bar to reach. Some peers wrote very little, despite the richness of the essential question. I was interested to see non-native English speakers in the group of peers. For some, understandably, this meant their writing needed more attention. Yet, I was interested to hear about their educational context--Erbil, Iraq, for instance! If the guidelines were more robust than they are, it might be that class participants would respond to essential questions in truly perspective-opening ways for the rest of us. It might be, for instance, that we could see the social dynamics of learning in play, and how at least one person might respond to those educational conditions. I would have welcomed that!",0,4,Lawrence Wray,48837664

He makes each lesson exciting, engaging, easy to learn, relevant - and  very much memorable. He uses video, images, storytelling, body language, all sorts of aids to get his points across and to make ideas stick in your mind. Frankly, he makes classes FUN, instead of a chore. Shane quickly becomes your favorite teacher, one that you would love to grab lunch with and have long discussions.
