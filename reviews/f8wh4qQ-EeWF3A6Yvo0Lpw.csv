It is ridiculous that the course is called English composition and yet 70% of my peers were unable to speak or write english properly. I'm not an english native speaker but I consider that my english is decent enough to do my assignments properly, that's why it is so frustrating that I spent time reviewing carefully other people's texts only to get absolute crap in return either by people who can't speak english, or by english speakers that are so lazy that they can't make a little effort to give you any sort of useful feedback.

The peer review and grading methodology must seem good as a theory but in practice, it has been an absolute fail. Add to that, the inability to have my work graded promptly - especially when it's turned in on time - but also add in the impossibility to get someone to respond to my questions or concerns. My peer reviewers seem to be unable to comprehend the basic fundamentals of the English language. It is very frustrating to receive feedback that is inaccurate with nothing objective to add. This happened not once or twice but over and over again. I've had my wife (who has several degrees and writes as a profession, along with my GED teacher, to review my work and they are baffled right along with me as to why my peers fail my work assignments. If this is the best Coursera can do - you have a failing model. My experience has taught me not to bother with purchasing a course either. This has been a HUGE waste my time and energy.

28822778~COURSE!~f8wh4qQ-EeWF3A6Yvo0Lpw,1510720326508,1,0,"I don't recommend this course because it is not well constructed.  There is obvious mismatch between what is taught and what is tested.  For example, in week 5, the content is about annotated bibliography, but the assignment is a case study and the evaluation questions consist of how effective introduction and conclusion are.  It confused many students.The class offers only links to online sites on how to write a case study.  There are plenty of business classes devoting the entire class on how to write a case study.  How can the teacher in this introduction to writing class expect new student to write a case study without at least a lecture on what it is, what it consists of and how to write it.Furthermore, it is only a week later (in week #6), there are lectures on introduction and conclusion.  Shouldn't they been taught in week #5 if students are asked to evaluation others' works on introduction and conclusion in week #5?There is fundamental issue (Chronology between lectures and assignments) in this class and it should be reviewed and corrected before given to the public.  It is only one of the two classes I took in coursera as tests.  I would say ""buyers beware"".  Don't be fooled by the universities.I suggest the provider to review the course material and improve quality.  Because at current offering, it is below standards.  It is confusing, like confused writing to readers or students.Sincerely,Amy  ",0,45,XiaoYan Wang,28822778

helpful in shaping the broad knowledge in English composition. I am much
impressed and inspired by the style and management of this course. During the
whole time of this course, I learned very astonishing things that’s have improved
my skills very broadly. Let’s me to start explaining from the first assignment
of this course. During the first week, Dr. Denis,
asked to write about your life history as a writer. It was a quite new thing
for me. It gave me time and opportunities to think about my previous life
experiences about writings. I started to write from my childhood when my
parents and kingartin teachers helped me a lot to start writing. This
assignment was a quite amazing miracle helping me to revise my knowledge and experiences
about writings. In the second week, Dr. Denis,
helped us to focus on critical readings. As critical reading is main habit
which required to write critically. Selection of a chapter of Coyle’s book was
very amazing thing. This book had also many other advices and terms which may
help a writer to critically focus and analysis of certain things. First time
when I tried to summarize it, make some questions and evaluate it, I felt very
tough job. But it helped a lot me to gaining this basic skill required to
become a successful writer. The project of visual analysis was a
quite new thing for me. First time when I started to write and describe about a
picture, I felt really much excited. Evaluation and arguing about visual texts are
a technique which require quite expertise. Just seeing picture, its evaluation,
argumentation about it and depicting arguments was the main pillar in shaping
me as an experience writer. Case studies was also a necessary step toward the
writing expertise. I have done this assignment with full of my potential. I
really felt myself as an experienced writer this occasion of Case study
assignment.From my early ages I have a great
interest in reading opinions and editorials on newspaper. It was my desire that
I can also be able write opinions. This course has fulfilled my all desires of
attaining writing expertise. I got much knowledge and important points from
visiting teacher lecture about opinion-editorials. I struggled my best to write
an effective opinions editorial article as my assignment to this course. I
shared my articles with my friends and they have really appreciated me. Now, I am writing for assignment of
final self-reflection. It is also a good opportunity for me revise all my
knowledge, training and expertise which I had gained during this course. The
projects of this course trained me enough that I can argue about any type of
piece of writing. Moreover, these projects also helped me to understand the
process of citation. Teacher helped to deliver the main features of paragraphs,
sentences and whole writings processes. As she described the 5C’s of writing
process. Every time, I kept these 5C’s in my mind to write anything weather of
this course or of other courses. Finally, I want to say special
thanks to Dr. Denis Comer for her struggles to deliver such novel kind of
knowledge and expertise. Thank you",0,0,Nauman Ahmed,63448862

From writing about personal feelings, my goals and fears and to writing an Op-Ed article, I learned Creative Writing. I started this course from a common literature student and ended up being a writer myself.   After starting this course, I was asked firstly to write under this heading “I am a Writer”, this thing created so much confidence in me, because before that, I was not considering myself a writer, but when the instructor told that how I am also a writer, my confidence in writing increased.I gained so much knowledge and skills from next 3 Major Projects. I got beautiful feedback from Peers. Throughout this course, I enjoyed writing and getting feedback from different people who new nothing about my own self but analyzed my writing. Nothing can be more neutral than that.  I must say Peer Review system is a great success. We come to know about our short comings and strengths and I am thankful to the ""Self Reflection"" Quizzes which made me reflect on my writing.  Now after this course, I have confidence in my writing that I can write about anything. This course is so beneficial for the beginners as well as other writers who want to enhance their writing skills. I am so much great-full to the team of this course.
