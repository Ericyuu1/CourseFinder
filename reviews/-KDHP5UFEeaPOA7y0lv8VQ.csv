111605062~COURSE!~-KDHP5UFEeaPOA7y0lv8VQ,1663179040437,1,0,"T​his is a personal study for me. I went maybe 3/4 of the way through this course and was consistently bummed out by the lack of insight be given into this disease. It's just a bunch of useless statistics that the interviewer and these doctors being interviewed continue to go back to and discuss. The ""essential facts"", as I see it, is simply data on people getting type 2 diabetes all over the globe, and carefully plotting a neatly scripted discussion of numbers and data comparisons that they use in no way to implement a hard effective strategy to engineer a way to eliminate this problem. A strategy, a solution, I myself can easily see. And, of course, they know what the answer to the problem is, but that would decimate a certain medically dependent status quo of the whole arrangement. And type 1 diabetes receives no consideration. Here's my suggestion to the makers of this course. Explain both of the diseases thoroughly. The history of it. What is known about it, every bit of knowledge. Nevermind saying, in the case of type 1 diabetes, that you don't know. That is just such an insult to the whole  collection of professionals who claim to be doing this research. Provide statistics only for the sake of pointing out the legitimate culprit. I should not have to say who these players are. After giving those statistics, provide logical methods for improving the health of a person. By way of the community, by way of training and educating the people who have the disease by people who understand the condition and what causes it and the way that it must be treated to develop a healthy level of physical competence.  Questions that must be asked. How does the body work? Why is it important for the body to perform this function? How does the body use certain things to get better? Inherently, the body possesess strong life promoting characteristics. Pathways that have innate abilities for recovery. It's all there, in everyone's body. There are many differences, but the state of the human body is consistent to a life giving way of existing. No matter what condition or deformity a person has, the ultimate state of the body moves in the direction of life. So, this study of diabetes needs to be given a hard objective investigation. What went wrong and how can it be made right? Simple. ",0,0,Stephen Gray,111605062

I found the course content interesting and relevant. The readings were fairly simple to digest as they consisted mainly of consumer blogs. A great place to start if you're looking for more information as many listed references.In regards to learning from discussions and assignments, I don't rate the peer review system for this course. I reviewed 8 submissions and there were examples of plagerism in all of them. One was almost enirely copied and pasted. There also tended to be a higher value placed on including stats into assignments despite relevance being poorly correlated. And some sort of grade exchange where other students posted requests for feedback in return for positive feedback. I was of the belief that assignments were allocated randomly but soon came to the realisation that I would never complete the course if I didn't share my assignment links.The value of the course is in the content which was great!

The course was very informative about diabetes as a whole, and involved a lot of people that are very well prepared in the topic. What I didn't like, however, was the fact that lectures were way too long. I think they couldbe shortened into smaller videos.

FYI, English isn’t my native tongue, so this matters. Other professors and speakers are fine as well; they are an encyclopedia of knowledge.I like the “Save Note” button when you want to capture a screen. You can also, highlight and save lines from the transcript, it helps to summarize the topic. The quizzes are great; you can take it again; it pushes you to go back to your notes to find out what you answered wrong, rather than giving the correct answer right away. Reviewing three other students is a great idea, as it shows you how others think, talk, communicate, write, as some of them have deep knowledge already but others simply give short answers, but that is all point, we all come from different backgrounds, isn’t it!There isn’t anything I didn’t like.Overall, thank you.
