Although I uploaded all my assigments and graded all the projects from my peers, I still haven´t been able to get my certificate because not enough people have graded mine. I have been posting and asking people in the forums to please review them, but after 24 days I am still waiting to get the sspecialization certificate. Tomorrow I will be billed again for this course when I actually finished almost a month ago. I am not even sure if I will ever get the certificate, I see people whose posts are from last year and I see their projectcs are still there waiting to be graded. ",0,6,Ailyn Garnica,3810446
