The portfolio project was more an exercise in Formik/Yup than it was in ""Advanced React""- Insufficient direction for assignment submission, resulting in various students submitting projects in different formats.  Some were submitted as .rar files, so I had to download 3rd party software in order to extract them (please just accept .zip files only), some submissions don't even work.  - Grading criteria for peer-reviewing is a little weak.  Many submissions have issues or other errors that would prevent them from ever being accepted in a professional setting, but because they pass all of the assignment's generic baked-in criteria, they are ""passing""- Ongoing plagiarism.  Many submissions are clearly and obviously plagiarized, and it seems Coursera does very little to prevent this.  This calls the entire validity of the course and its value into question, and dilutes the value of the certification.  Plagiarized submissions also don't count towards your required 3 peer reviews, so every time you find a plagiarized one, you need to spend time reporting it, and then still do 3 more anyways.

But there is something that needs improving. 
I think the course is too short to cover the concepts it presented. because we are not getting enough examples to fully understand the concepts thrown at us. so maybe make Advanced React 1 and Advanced React 2.

My biggest grip is the final assignment, it required us to solve it using Formik, a form validation library that was never mentioned before, and as it appreas it's wildely used.

So why not dedicate a video teaching Formik? why waste many videos about the controlled components when in general people use Formik?
