What should have been 6 weeks took me closer to one whole year to complete. The professors were very difficult to understand and used inconsistent wording or jargon that was definitely not necessary all the time. The course assumes that you have a certain level of understanding in discrete mathematics, but the supporting math course they recommend is no longer available. Overall it's outdated, there are no dedicated helpers in the forums, the teachers are not available and partway through the course (perhaps due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine) some of the explanatory videos disappeared with no explanation and I had to find them on youtube. I can't recommend this course if you're a beginner programmer like myself. It's just too advanced. I did learn a lot, but I also spent about 500 USD on the coursera subscription just to get through the class.

If the lecturers are reading off a script, then it doesn't seem like it as many of them accidentally mess up their words. This can confuse novice learners. The slides appear to be the critical portion of the course, with the lecturers explaining what is on the slides and little more.I used Python for this course. Most novice learners will be using IDLE and not touch anything related to PyCharm (or, like me, already have PyCharm Community installed rather than PyCharm EDU and would not like to experience the annoyance of having to install yet another PyCharm). Much of the input for the autograder relies on sys.stdin, which would read files stored on the server. However, for client testing on IDLE, this needs to be replaced with an input() function so that you could test for bugs. Novice learners may not know how to do this and will experience frustration when their input isn't accepted.Many of the lecturers are probably not native English speakers, and that is not a problem. Personally, I can easily understand what they were saying. However, other people who do not have experience listening to those with more pronounced accents may have difficulty understanding the lecturers, and the accents will obviously not help when it comes to understanding new and difficult concepts.The usage of pseudocode is understandable, as people will be coding in multiple languages. However, I would recommend that the pseudocode use names such as ""max_array"" and ""min_array"" rather than simply ""M"" and ""m"" with the lecturer having to remind us which is which. Same for indexes, don't use ""i"" and ""j"", try to use ""row"" and ""column."" This will teach us good coding habits (use descriptive names) while making explanations clearer.Of all the courses, the ""worst"" part of the course is likely the weeks involving Dynamic Programming. Dynamic Programming is a very difficult but also very important. Most novices will have never seen the concept of Dynamic Programming, so the need for a clear lecturer and in-depth explanations becomes much more important. However, the explanations are rushed (which is not good as 2D arrays are being used more and are much less intuitive). Also, I'm surprised they didn't talk about shortest paths/number of paths, which would help people get used to 2D arrays.Finally: Unless you are already experienced in these algorithmic concepts, the time you need to complete this course is probably much greater than the course's estimates.

The slides are the centrepiece of the course, as the presenters rarely stray from the bullet points and pseudocode they're comprised of.I learned a lot during this course. Although, to gain confidence in your knowledge, this is a course that will require you to seek out additional materials to supplement your learning. Perhaps unsurprising being an introductory course, but the presenters struggle when faced with setting expectations. Throughout the course presenters often gloss over fairly complex concepts, treating them as they were trivial knowledge. This applies to mathematical definitions, proofs where most steps are skipped, tree diagrams without the context of their underlying theory, or bullet points used in place of what could be detailed explanations.All material is left equally weighted. Rather than providing explanations like: ""We don't need to go into detail on this, only x concept from it is important for what we want to focus on. Reference this chapter in this book for more detail."" presenters would read mathematical definitions verbatim from the slides and move on. I was often unsure of how much I would need to know about such concepts.In terms of communication ability, the presenters don't hold up against many of the free/low-cost services I'm accustomed to using, for example: MIT OpenCourseWare, Udacity, edX, Khan Academy, Code School, Treehouse, etc. Perhaps unsurprising, as these competing services often feature professional communicators rather than professional researchers. But the marketplace for quality online education is definitely becoming a competitive one. Users now expect nothing less than presenters with exceptional communication/teaching ability.In most videos the presenters read verbatim from the slides and motion with their hands to explain concepts that would be better broken down on a whiteboard. Rarely straying from the slides, the times the presenters go into more depth on a concept, you get a scribble in the corner of a slide, lacking the clarity I've come to expect when approaching complex concepts from master educators like YouTuber PatrickJMT or Khan Academy. After a couple weeks into the course, I just went straight to the slides, read MIT's Introduction to Algorithms, and skipped most of the course videos.But all things considered, the course served as a good curriculum to guide my focus through the introductory concepts, regardless of where I sought it out.",0,2,Nasim Zoubeiri,14288803

For example, in the lecture of edit distance, the realization of the matrix was not well explained at all. I personally appreciate a lot of the thorough proving steps introduced in the lectures, however I personally think the proofs are often not well explained to the audience (I also understand that it's more difficult to explain proving steps). Considering the large variety of audience, I would recommend the instructors separate the comprehensive more in-depth knowledge into optional videos, in this way the audiences could decide if they want to spend time in optional videos or not based on their own needs, meanwhile the instructors could spend a little bit more time to explain the difficult concepts better.

I finished 100% of the assignments even though half of that was required to pass the course, and I have a few concerns about this course:1 - Poor Use of Pseudo Codes. While Pseudo codes are perfectly fine and sometimes extremely helpful, none of the Pseudo codes in this course were intuitive and can be efficiently translated into real codes. First of all, variable names are confusing and do not tell you what this symbol holds at the first glance, just like how the whole course was taught in a mathematical way rather than programming way, variable names are all like i, j, s, t, l .... when we could have made them into something meaningful and readable.2 - Since only Pseudo codes were given, it's hard for newer students to learn how a working algorithm actually looks like and how it runs at each step. I feel that either you already know how to do it, or you can't come up with one at all before debugging for hours. So it is more important to show something that actually works from the beginning, then students can imitate -> improvise -> create. Again the Pseudo codes are terrible examples.3 - DP sections were badly explained,  really really bad ........ any of the YouTube videos and GeeksforGeeks explanations are 10X clearer and more intuitive. I feel like the instructors just wanted to teach the math instead of how to program. But the math isn't any difficult to understand, the key is to convert ideas into codes, and this part was completely ignored. ",0,2,Melody Chen,34095549

It teaches of algorithmic analysis so you know which algorithm is more efficient, gives some examples of cool techniques and provides challenges to apply those techniques.However, there are things that I hate about this course. First of all this is about forums. They are broken down into sessions and there are too little people on each session. Staff provides exactly zero help. If you are stuck, you have no hope on these forums and will need to find help somewhere else.Programming assignments are great, they are relevant, interesting, challenging and the automatic grader system estimates not only if we get the correct answer but also the efficiency of our algorithm. There have been some problems in divide and conquer section though. I've been struggling with implementing binary search (which is quite a simple algorithm!) in JavaScript to pass the assignment for weeks. I've written and rewritten it in different ways, done hundreds of manual and automated tests, posted on course forums (receiving zero answers) and have gotten the same error again and again. I was able to solve this only by switching to Python. I am quite sure there is a mistake in the test case, which cost me hours and hours. Overall, the programming assignments are very time consuming and lack of support and not showing test cases make things worse.I do not like that we cannot see the test case where our program fails. Perhaps, if you could figure out a test case that might fail in your program that would make you a better programmer but I felt more like it was wasting of our time. The main thing is to analyze the test case that fails and understand why, it will bring the same result without wasting time and feeding anger, Some lecturers have a strong Russian accent, that is very distracting. It is not a lot of work to take some English pronunciation training before making a course, isn't it?Overall, I enrolled for the specialization and planned to buy it in full but bought only this course to start with.

Now exercise and assignments are spot on but you are forced to relay on other sources to grasp everything. I doubt anyone taking this course has not reached for ""outer"" help at least once.

24240589~COURSE!~nA4RUW01EeW8nRIpKnwp7Q,1556201760359,5,0,"I have a Mechatronics MSc and now I'm transitioning to CS after starting to work as a software developer. Even with an engineering background, this course was challenging: you need to think hard when designing algorithms, then precisely design and test a solution. (Stress) testing is a concept that is frequently used in everyday software development, too.For some assignments, you'll find the pseudocode in the slides so those need less brain power to implement but for others, you'll have to come up with your own original solution. This requires time and research. It's possible to ask others in the forum or Google around for hints, and most assignments can be solved in multiple ways (e.g. I solved several of the dynamic programming assignments with memoized recursive functions). You won't find many hints from the teachers, though since that would spoil the learning part here - the essence of the course is not in the slides but in solving the assignments on your own.Upsides of the course are the automatic grading system, the diversity of the assignments and the quality of the mathematical content and the slides.Downsides of the course are the sometimes bad accent of the teachers - this could be eased with more accuraate captioning for the videos -, and the clumsiness of downloading slides (they are not available in one package, and trust me, you're going to use them a lot!)Prerequisites for this course: you will need linear algebra knowledge to know about e.g. geometrical series or limit values, and you will need to know how mathematical proofs work. This is all advanced high school or 1st semester college material, so nothing special. Fortunately the teachers always point to extra links if you're in trouble.Also, you'll need working knowledge for 1 programming language. Fortunately for many languages, you won't need to care about I/O, it's already in the starter files. I learned Python just for fun, during this course for example. All that is needed is basic control statements (loops-if), arrays and functions, nothing more.Tips: 1. Don't give up! 2. You don't need to solve all the assignments, the ones after the minimum level are usually more advanced. 3. When in trouble, stress test if you can, it helps a lot. 4. If you're confident, you can 'make a run for it' and submit your file - you can submit as many times as you want.",0,69,Greg G.,24240589
29259062~COURSE!~nA4RUW01EeW8nRIpKnwp7Q,1556197422752,5,0,"Opted for 5 over 4. Not a perfect course but damn close: Assuming 'basic knowledge' one of the languages suggested should also have as a pre-requisite 'introductory computer science' since having an ability to code in say python at a basic level doesn't necessarily mean you understand anything about file and bitstream IO, or other useful abstractions that will make this course a wee bit more interesting.  Anyone who doesn't have a strong grasp of CS principles shouldn't be dissuaded however, it just means that your learning curve will be steeper.  The trick is digging your heels in and researching the problems, sticking to your guns and hammering out even the most ugly of code until you have a correct solution... AND THEN trying to make the thing faster.  You will get faster at writing our your plan, faster at implementing, and learn to read code line by line to understand what is happen beneath the abstraction. I'd also urge people to avoid using built-in functionality of your language to solve a lot of these problems, ie. in the Majority Element problem, you *could* just use python's built-in counter to count instances for you but by doing that, do you really understand what is happening beneath the hood? Do you really understand what the output of that abstraction is doing? Probably not. So do it the 'by-hand' way and then take advantage of the built-ins when you rewrite the code for your own use or to put on your repo.  All in all, a great 'trial by fire' course if you're a novice, and if you're not a novice, it will help make you a better programmer. For sure.  ",0,19,Josh Fiddler,29259062

I am taking the Data Structures course in parallel, and I find the teaching style of Mr. Kulikov in particular works beautifully for me personally.The greatest takeway for me from this course is my newly-found confidence in Problem Solving, not merely learning the algorithms themselves, and this is a skill that the course content forced me to learn through hard work and deep thinking. Prior to this course, my proof skills were truly pathetic - I could generally come to the optimal solution through ""intuition"" and ""gut feeling"", but I could almost never prove why the solution was correct.

I'm obviously not an expert in this field, but I've been an educator before, and my own impression of the assignments was that they were extremely well designed: it was impossible to pass them without knowing what you were doing, the tools to approach them were always found in the lectures, and the challenge problems pushed your knowledge even farther. I would recommend the specialization to everyone.

These courses are the really good base, after which you can open the books related to algorithms and read more details if you needed.I am definitely going to complete the whole specialization!The only thing which was not convenient for me is that both courses Algorithmic Toolbox and Data Structures are started at the same time. It was difficult to find out the time for both courses and spend enough time to solve all assignments instead of only enough for passing.Anyway, now I am started the second iteration of the course and I am going to solve all assignments which I skipped.  Big thanks to Daniel, Alex, Pavel, Neil and Mike!Regards,Sergey",0,4,Sergey Li,91152

To review why this course (and series) is awesome: 1) 25 + programming assignments, ranging from easy to advanced. 2) Unlike many other CS courses, this course allows multiple programming languages. You have choices of C C++, Java, Python2, Python3. They may add more to the list :).3) Super active forum, the learners come here to debate approaches and share knowledge a lot. There were so many times I'm convinced my algorithm can't be optimized anymore, then another guy came in with another genius idea. 4) Plus, the instructor, Mr. Alex S. Kulikov is a super nice guy, he made 300+ forum posts in the first session alone, to guide learners thoroughly.Comprehensive grader: grades you on correctness, time use, memory use. You have no choice but to optimize all 3 aspects to pass.This course has premium access. However, both the quality and quantity are well worth the price. You can read other learners' comments and many agree with this. ",0,7,Huynh Long Do,15854114
