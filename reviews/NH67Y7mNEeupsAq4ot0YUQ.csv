8432706~COURSE!~NH67Y7mNEeupsAq4ot0YUQ,1653769266143,2,0,Very cool visualizations in their terminal. So helpful!!! But audit track appears impossible since all lessons are locked until one upgrades. Sad!,0,0,Guy Grimm,8432706
83779753~COURSE!~NH67Y7mNEeupsAq4ot0YUQ,1677342261854,4,0,Very detailed course C pointers and related. Some might find the content and exercises a bit easy but overall it is a high-quality course. Instructors are easy to follow. Just video buffering in Codecast is annoyingly slow sometimes.,0,0,sisi L,83779753

106759622~COURSE!~NH67Y7mNEeupsAq4ot0YUQ,1668201157720,5,0,"I'm really having a blast with these courses.  They are super thorough.  I feel like I really understand pointers and using malloc really well now.  My only issue is that the autograder for some of the assignments can act a little weird, especially with programs that have a bunch of pointers.  Sometimes the autograder would time out with my submissions and I wouldn't get any feedback as to what was wrong.  This led to a bunch of time wasted reinventing the wheel before I realized that I was on the right track at the beginning.  I have noticed this with other C courses, so it's a common frustration.
