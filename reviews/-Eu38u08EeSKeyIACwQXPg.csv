He could have mentioned his book and website once or twice, but instead in each lecture he drones on…and on…and on about his so-called “citizen science” website, which is in reality a “pay to play” club type website. It isn’t citizen science if one must pay to participate. I’m sure Dr. Hare is aware of this, but chose to cash in on the opportunity for self-promotion. As with all Coursera courses, you get what you pay for, and I am quite reluctant to enroll in any of the paid courses, given the abysmal quality of the free courses. ",0,0,R Reece,61078109

It didn't feel based in science. The chosen breed of dog really is not representative of dogs as a species, and I believe dogs were being bred certainly as far back as Egyptian times and that's just for starters. I'd hoped to learn something about dog behaviour and dog cognition. For example to what extent does digging its own scrape to make a bed fulfil a dogs needs? How does a dog perceive a human kissing it... After two or 3 videos I gave up. There's even a sentence that states that using things learnt as life skills and applying in novel situations is not learning! There is invented wordage like dognition, and the so called games... I didn't like it and I didn't rate it and I won't be buying the book. I'm surprised a university has associated its name to this really. Very Americancentric.

All this helped in making learning a pleasure & fun. I was also very pleased with the sensitivity welfare issues were discussed, something that should never be ignored in the pursuit of academic knowledge.The Genius of Dogs may not be required reading but I believe that it is actually essential in a better understanding of the material. It is very well written & anyone interested in dogs, regardless of his/her level can truly enjoy it without even noticing how much he/she is learning.I am also glad of the comparative approach of the study of dog cognitive skills & having the opportunity to get a glimpse of the lives of various other species.

You don't need Dognition to learn a lot and get a lot out of the course, but if you don't have a dog to play with or feel like spring for the fee (which again, are highly optional and not needed to learn from this course), you will miss out a bit.

8179201~COURSE!~-Eu38u08EeSKeyIACwQXPg,1626244721316,5,0,"Excellent course. Very interesting and made me think about how my Sunshine thinks. Unfortunately, she passed away a week ago and so I am not able to use Dognition with her. She is a pekingese and has often been rated in low intelligence. Yes she would not learn tricks and could barely be taught how to sit but I often observed that she was very intelligent in that she was cunning or would find ways to communicate with me about a chew that was under that table and could not be reached or a couple of months before she passed, would call me (even wake me up) to give her a piece of her treat. She had different barks which I recognized for different needs eg when there is a stranger outside to when she wanted something from me. This course provided me with scientific acknowledgement of what I observed with Sunshine and also that it wasn't just me that dogs (and animals) may have intelligence that we do not recognize as traditional intelligence of animals (eg doing tricks) or comparing it to humans. What I also appreciated with Dr Hare was when he talked about dogs today and looked at other countries who eat dogs but also brought it back locally about the shelters in USA and the puppy mill. It is important to recognize that even in our own backyard, we are not perfect, as it is often easier to criticize other countries or cultures. Highly recommend this course if you are interested in animals especially dogs and their way of potentially thinking or processing information. ",0,0,Jennifer,8179201

One suggestion is that when you are showing a graph or picture or video, one cannot enlarge the scale or easily move it so that one can read what you are describing as graph and lines and its scare are very small. Perhaps a younger more savvy person can do this, but an old person like myself would like to easily see what you are describing at the same time you are describing it.  I enjoy the dognition experiments as well--hopefully you could set up a plan evn as a fee for a new game a month that we could play to continue to citizen science!

For example, the clicker part where you suggest there's no evidence that clickers make it easier to train dogs, well in my experience clickers really make things faster, but my experience can't determine that this clicker thing is a law.

For example, dogs evolved from wolves not because of human's intentional domestication but due to ""self-domestication"" 12 -15000 ago.  Also, it is generally regarded that certain breeds of dogs are smarted than other. However, in this course, Professor Hare points out that cognition involves many types of intelligence rather than one and there is even tremendous variation within a dog breed in temperament, behavior and especially cognition.

The course reveals surprising and practical insights about how having a better understanding of dogs helps improve our understanding of ourselves, our human history, and contemporary society.   The course explains how science helps to correct many of our common misunderstandings about the intelligence of animals, and summarizes how the manner in which we study animal behavior and cognition is changing today.   The course is fun.  The video lectures are clear and concise.  Everything is very well organized and delivered with enthusiasm and clarity.  The quizzes are not technical nor particularly challenging but do help with learning the course material.  The course has references to optional reading materials and optional activities from dognition.org  that you can explore with your own dog at home.
