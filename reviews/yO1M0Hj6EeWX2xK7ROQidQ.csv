The time commitment required is much greater than advertised. First, the weekly lectures frequently skimmed passed material that will be tested in the associated quiz, forcing you to scour the forums and Google to expand on the material (ex: cube notation). Second, the way the quizzes were crafted were borderline cheap shots at making the class difficult. For example, weeks seven thru eight's practice quizzes would have problems of a certain type, only so that the graded quiz would list problems of a completely different type. What was the point of practicing then? Third, the VM for the circuit diagramming labs was so locked down, you couldn't increase the display resolution so many hours are wasted squinting at the monitor to move the cursor literally 1-2 pixels over lest a signal isn't actually connected. All these factors contribute to making the time commitment realistically >= 5 hours per week for the practice and graded quizzes alone, as you will be redoing them multiple times. Overall, I would recommend you find another reputable university to cover Digital Systems. ",0,0,Jerry Lin,32914263
