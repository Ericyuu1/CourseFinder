2410295~COURSE!~39Z16y7BEeitCBL1JEiWag,1620422936708,2,0,"The weakest of all 3 courses so far. Only few videos each week, the rest consist mostly of reading. Like 1 video, followed by 4 readings. I would have preferred to be bit more balanced. A bit more balance would be nice, week 2 or 3 seems to be disproportionately heavy. But it does provide some useful information, thought it's a bit dry and slog to get through the reading. Warning: Anyone 
thinking of doing the Specialization, consider the Honours track with 
pinch of salt. For some twisted/lazy logic the final Speclalization 
certificate doesn't show the Honours banner. Might not be a big deal to 
some, but still a bit of a let down. Especially when you paid for the 
subscription, don't extend it just to complete the last week of Honours ",0,0,Jun-Hoe Lee,2410295

I've taken other courses on Coursera but this course is exemplary because of it structure, focus, and skilled instructors. Each course is well organized and stays on topic. However, if there are any related topics students should explore, the instructors have provided links for students to have a semi-guided self-taught journey on their own time. Other courses don't do that. The focused lessons keep data neophytes like myself feel less overwhelmed by the information taught in the course. Modern Big Data Analysis using SQL is a very broad yet important topic. However, the instructors on this course really ameliorate that overwhelming feeling with clear and focused lectures. The instructors come across as not only subject matter experts but as seasoned teaching professionals. They can explain the concepts in the courses in a clear and succinct manner without oversimplifying. Other instructors on Coursera, while skilled in their field, don't have the teaching finesse as Ian and Glynn do. If more courses on Coursera were taught by Ian and Glynn and others like them, I would pursue even more studies with Coursera.  I hope this feedback is heard.
