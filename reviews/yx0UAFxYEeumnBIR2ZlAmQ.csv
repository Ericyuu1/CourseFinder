The way the course is structured is extremely basic, contains mistakes (it seems as if it has not been reviewed before posting it), uses a platform which is not really user friendly, but, most importantly, the same knowledge can be aquired FOR FREE by watching any kind of tutorial on the internet or having a quick look at the basic documentation for NumPy and Pandas.

10400300~COURSE!~yx0UAFxYEeumnBIR2ZlAmQ,1623271989357,1,0,"Sorry. I have really tried to do my best to go through the project, since I appreciate the efforts of the instructor. He really tries to do a good job introducing a complicated topic in as simple fashion as possible. But...

I have managed to finish just 3 steps of... how many? 12? Why so? Stay tuned guys (c)

At step 1, I have noticed that the instructor does not follow the PEP8 guidelines in the code formatting. Ok, we'll live with this (even though it is stated that basic Python knowledge is required for the project. and PEP8 is among the first topics to be introduced...) I am not an expert in Python, just trying it as hobby, but even I see that the spacing in the code is ugly.

In step 2 (mini-challenge) - the task says to generate the random numbers starting at 0, yet the answer given by the instructor puts 1 instead of 0. Well, the idea is still understandable, let us go on and excuse this glitch (this is not a typo, since it is also being said). 
By the way, ""the basic knowledge of Python is required"" - why not show here how to treat incorrect/erroneous user input? Would be just elegant, in my view. 

Then, in step 3 the instructor uses ""sum"" as a variable name. What the hell is this? Even the IDE showed in color that something strange was going on... By the way, the sum function should have been used just a few lines later (but it was not used - see the next item) - I am excited to see how surprised the instructor would be by the traceback to appear.

Finally, in mini challenge 3 the ""distance between two vectors"" is calculated as the square root of element-wise sum of the vectors squared. Uffffff... Just before this task the instructor has encouraged us to go google what is the distance. I would love to see the definition which he has finally used for the 'official solution'. Basically this means that a distance between two vectors is a vector (???), and if the vectors are equal, the distance in nonzero (???).

Sorry again, but I have had to stop at this point. At the end, this guided project is paid for - do I pay for killing my brain? 

Ah, and by the way, having passed 3 steps of 12 with the instructor, I have managed to answer the final quiz questions using a single attempt and about 3 minutes. Nope, I am not a pro - just yesterday I installed pandas and numpy on my PC. So, even the final quiz is so poorly planned that it required nothing from the guided project to cope with it.

Once again, thank you for the attempt, but so far I would grade it with negative mark if it is possible. Hope this can be corrected - or otherwise I personally find this project unacceptable, and Coursera just loses its face by allowing it in without proper testing.",0,16,Evgeny Karpushkin,10400300
