All of the assignments are graded by other students who may not speak English very well, may not know what they are doing, or simply don't care for whatever reason. This means that for a lot of my assignments that I worked so hard on - and I thought, did well - were graded with a failing score and zero feedback as to why (even though the person is supposed to say why). I understand that there are too many assignments for just these two professors to grade, but I really wish something with this system could change.

68480428~COURSE!~b75Wh7MYEeWKaQ6n__gsuQ,1618428033676,3,0,"April 2021.  I appreciate the structure & awareness in writing
different types of communication.   I would have graded it higher if was
up to date, they had spell checked the course even used proper Uppercase sentence
structure in their bullets (to name a few).  
This course is outdated; some info being 10+ years old.  In the end, it was weeks three and four assignments that were not well explained. One of those weeks you do your own review of a
lesson so that you gain better use and knowledge of the Rubric. The other,
you write your own version of the lesson.  Both require Peer
reviews.  

 It was not clear what was needed,
both weeks seemed like a copy of each other. 
I turned to the forums for clarity where others mentioned the same thing.  As I progressed, I found many people had incomplete or
did not complete the assignments. Some put their correct answers in the wrong week’s
assignment. Because it’s “Peer” based, it takes a long time for others to
review final assignments.  I found some
had waited over a year, most were several weeks.  Again, it’s confusing what a person is to
do.  

 In week three, I had to resubmit my
assignment twice because the Peers responses created a tie.  While structured correctly, Peers either didn’t
understand the assignment or the Rubric. 
In the end, I simplified the “email” assignment, finally two Peers each gave
me 100% and both replied with “good” in the comments.   To put it plainly,
this course needs a complete overhaul.  PS: I am unable to break this review down into paragraphs, another example of outdate technology. ",0,0,Patricia Seberson,68480428
