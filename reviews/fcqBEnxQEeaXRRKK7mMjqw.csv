Most of the time the presentation slides were filled with so many texts that you would wonder if its a presentation or an article. This course was better than the previous two courses though.

This course covers many topics including pharmacoeconomic, marketing strategy, intellectual property strategy, portfolio management, managed markets and strategic alliances. Moreover, there is a lecture case study from startup to success. Lectures in this course are given not only by university professors but also many industry experts working on drug development at big pharmaceutical companies and were glad to share real success stories that they had. I enjoyed accessing all modules especially the last one which is a case study in Biotech from the very beginning. It was very interesting as it provided an example for serendipity still playing a role despite the technological breakthrough in Drug discovery. While working on NNRTI for HIV, unexpected reduction in Uric Acid caused by a drug metabolite was observed in Phase 1 Multiple Dose Study, accordingly a new drug called Lesinurad was developed.All in all, I highly recommend this course for whoever interested in interested in Drug development and commercialization",0,0,Michael Magdy Fahmy,41627787
