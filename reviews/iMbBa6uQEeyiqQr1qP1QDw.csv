57075465~COURSE!~iMbBa6uQEeyiqQr1qP1QDw,1677502354773,4,0,"The course was great and very enjoying (same as the rest of the course series). However, after completing the 4th course of this specialization, I felt more competitive and the assessment process was not giving me the opportunity to compete more with other students. Lastly, all the information, tools and tips provided are quite new to me but there were times through the slides that I would like to be introduced to 1 or 2 more. For example, FinViz is a great source but it would be good to have some alternatives. Same stands for more practical situations like what happens if we struggle in a step during the analysis (no publicly available data, handling awkward questions etc.).Overall, very satisfied! Great work!",0,0,Alexandros Oikonomidis,57075465

The tips were extremely useful, the learning was very practical and I feel as though I gained some fantastic insight into management consulting. John is a remarkable teacher, he can really break down big problems into ""buckets"" and help you find solutions :) Thoroughly enjoyed this, and look forward to the next.",0,1,Zainab Sarang,43734931
91612877~COURSE!~iMbBa6uQEeyiqQr1qP1QDw,1673504800185,5,0,"During this section (part 4), I did work slowly in the first two weeks of outlined work with tools I was very unfamiliar with.  I believe this is only a result of me being a ""green cap"" and even more so, coming with a background in pharmacy and data science rather than business.  I really found weeks 3-5 to relate to my workplace and project-based work in an office with a team.  I firmly believe that Coursera provides as much benefit to me as I make of it, and none of my interviews have ever inquired about how many certificates I have done.  That being said, I really have found several things from John Kim in these courses that have shaped the way I tackle a problem, speak about projects to my managers, and even how I talk in interviews.  I appreciate that this course has the same instructor, because 1.) He is excellent at explaining things and 2.) Consistency is good compared to a google certificate that had a new speaker every module, like a YouTube ad instead of focusing on the material being taught.  I felt like I got a lot of benefit from this section and am excited to finish the specialization. ",0,1,James Wade,91612877
