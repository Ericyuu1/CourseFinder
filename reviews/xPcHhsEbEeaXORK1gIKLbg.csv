6679562~COURSE!~xPcHhsEbEeaXORK1gIKLbg,1675349799431,1,0,"The topic is so interesting. However, I am terribly disappointed at the quality of course material and content. In many cases (including assessments), poor language, low use of basic instructional design, non-proof read content, non-intelligible accents have destroyed the potential of this course. It is sad that this course content has not been QCed. 
Separately, this entire course feels like a blah jabber at Davos. Talks about motherhood and apple pie, but rarely talks about the practical ""hows"". Showing an example of a telephone company or some other organization which no one outside a small district in Europe has heard of, doesn't help. Just ends up shooting the credibility of an important topic. ",0,0,Suhas Dutta,6679562

It also has high video production quality and receives a second star for that. However, after that the course really breaks down. Many of the reading materials include low resolution images that are unreadable. The actual content of the course is either way too general (e.g., waste is bad and reducing waste is good) or specific case studies that are interesting, but often lack serious substance. Overall, I wanted to get more out of this course and did not. Another unfortunate area is that most weeks there is a short assignment that requires very little effort and is basically just a nominal exercise. Although the exercise themselves are very easy and good to enact some of the principles, you need to review three peers for each and this required me checking multiple times a day for almost a week to get my required reviews.
