Some of the speakers are not easy to understand and in some scenes there is so much background noise (interview with a Nestlé employee comes to mind) that it is impossible to understand. The subtitles are in .txt format and not of really good quality. It took me ages to put it in a nice Word document format to make it readable. I would gladly have paid extra to get some decent documents to work with. One text document gives the text of the previous week's lecture! There are several typos in the quizzes. This does not give a professional impression. The additional reading list is hardly any help as most of the documents mentioned are behind a paywall, if they can be found at all. I don't understand why it wasn't possible to add links leading to the documents and why ESCP Europe could not provide some of the PDFs directly. Some content was outdated, the videos seem to be from around 2012 and it does show a bit. Speaker of week 4 and 5 was very good - factual, clear, whereas the speakers for the first weeks were a bit tiring. - Too much advertisement for various ESCP programmes.

These readings are optional, but it would be nice to offer online students some additional resources as well, as the videos don't have time to dig into the details. Also, the forums aren't really active, which isn't surprising given that there are excellent questions that are still unanswered (and typos in one of the quizzes that haven't been fixed since reported a year ago).
