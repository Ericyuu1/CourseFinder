Correct answers are marked incorrect (the first complaints about that in the discussion forum date back two years). The data set for the exercises (external source) seem to change and depending on your location will provide you with different data (missing data!). In order to complete the first peer-reviewed assignment, I had to use a data set provided by a fellow student in the forum -  since the data set I could download from the ""official"" link was missing essential variables. Then I had to do a massive amount of data wrangling because that data set had some other issues (doing data analysis always involves data wrangling, but I should not spend three hours getting a working data set for an assignment in a course the instructor points out specifically that it is not about data wrangling but only about data visualization).

76557125~COURSE!~V-oQ9Z8QEeeVAQohwd1tqg,1614093238558,3,0,Course content is good and important for the real business world.  My primary issue and why I won't give 5 stars is that the week 3 assignment grading was very subjective and had low margin for error.  With a different classmate grader each time I just had to mass produce graphs for each question to make sure the different opinions and tastes were covered.  It took about 4 attempts of tweaking the original submission.,0,0,Josh Hieb (jhieb),76557125

27480834~COURSE!~V-oQ9Z8QEeeVAQohwd1tqg,1589186612696,3,0,"The course materials are generally useful. the videos are reasonably well explained so that is positive. The main concern I have about the course is the peer review in weeks 3 and 4. My concern is as follows: Students are relying on other students interpretation of the course materials to provide an assessment of other students work. For example, a student who has little understanding of the course materials can provide poor feedback to other students out of ignorance. Furthermore, a student may submit a poor assignment and may receive a passing grade. Is there a  lack of oversight on the side of the course administrators. If successive peer-reviewed submissions are required it can take many days for a students work to be graded depending on the number of course attendees. The course should be graded by an expert rather than peer-reviewed for those two reasons.",0,6,Jonathan Dunne,27480834

Quizzes have some technical errors that seem to have been reported repeatedly over time (but not fixed especially in recent times); also, it would be very useful to get an explanation why an answer is right or wrong like in other Coursera courses.
