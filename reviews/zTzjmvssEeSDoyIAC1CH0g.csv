The choice of ending with the death of Socrates but not really including Plato or Aristotle or spending more time on the continuation of history seemed a bit random though.

80060992~COURSE!~zTzjmvssEeSDoyIAC1CH0g,1616004488390,4,0,"Light as it may be, one criticism is that the anticipated time suggested for readings, in particular, were unrealistic because they did not account for taking of notes.  Using 11-point Calibri font, this course resulted in a total of 251 pages of notes in my case, mostly from the readings.  Consequently, my time devoted to study far exceeded the suggested time periods.  I suppose I could have just engaged in the readings casually and met the anticipated time, but what would be the point of that?  Another, more significant issue is that the spelling in the transcription of lectures (probably done by machine) was consistently wrong, particularly with reference to proper names of people and places.  I know there will be a bit of variation anyway when translating Greek names in English, but these were more egregious errors.  I found it a bit trying to continually investigate, from other sources, what the actual name was intended to be.  To cite one of many examples, note how Chalcidice is mistakenly spelled as a ""sea"" in the 40th lecture (""The Fourth Century:  Philip II and Alexander The Great).  So some proper review and editing of the transcriptions would be very helpful and take a rather onerous burden from students.  Otherwise, I greatly appreciated the wealth of information and presentations by the professor.",0,0,Kelly Sills,80060992

Lectures are engaging and concepts are thought-provoking. He also offered a lot of significant insights on the various important events and personalities of the periods covered, as well as insights on how one should approach the study of Greek history. The study of Ancient Greeks -- which involves analysis on the causes and effects of different events and the individual actions and ways of thinking of the personalities involved -- will always have its relevance in the study of society, economics, politics, and literature. I agree when the Professor said: ""The Greeks are good to think with."" I love the study of history in general, and I'm happy I took this course as it has been an enriching experience for me. I've specifically learned more about the Greek Dark Ages, Homer and his works Iliad and Odyssey, the Archaic Age, and the city-states of Sparta and Athens. I've been very interested in the discussions on the Persian Wars and Peloponnesian War; the strategies of Peisistratos, Themistocles, and Pericles; the differing styles of historians Herodotus and Thucydides; and the rule of Philip II and Alexander. Knowledge of Ancient Greece is just a step towards learning more about Ancient History and World History. I love the idea of how everything could be connected and that it's also about continuous learning by reading more.
