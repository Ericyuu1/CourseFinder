With my first assignment, my feedback (which was supposed to be two pages) was ""good,"" ""okay,"" and one semi-helpful paragraph. The assignments I critiqued were blank pages and one 2 paragraph review of a hotel in the Philippines. With my sanding assignment, I got one person who said she couldn't critique me because she didn't speak English and 2 others who wrote one letter and failed me. I resubmitted, including a statement to just move on if the reader didn't want to participate or to provide feedback if they thought I didn't pass.

I also deleted my previous assignment. I did use the discount to sign up for scribophile. If you're serious about writing, reading others work, giving and receiving feedback, I suggest doing that instead. For Coursera, I would suggest: 1. students cannot be anonymous (that's where the lack of work and feedback seems to come from) 2. program will not allow feedback or assignments to be submitted unless it meets certain criteria, like word count with non-repeating actual words and 3. feedback is also graded. 4. Students cannot move on in the program unless they get passing grades on assignments and feedback. I'm guessing that whomever is in here doing that isn't paying for a subscription, so I'd also suggested dropping and blocking students who are just in here messing around. I don't know why anyone is signing up for this and wasting everyone's time, but whatever the reason, Coursera needs to figure out how to manage that problem.

It was unclear where one should post remarks, whether in the box on the grading panel or in the comments to the author.

Because I have only an old refurbished computer that does not have top of the line features, making PDF files did not always work as planned. OpenOffice and Adobe Acrobat sometimes easily converted to PDF for submissions, but sometimes did NOT. That made it difficult for some reviewers to open. Had I known earlier, I would have bought a new computer and avoided some frustrating submission difficulties. I really appreciate the effort some people had to go through to open my odd submissions. They gave me some valuable tips in their critiques that I might have missed out on had they not persisted. SO: Suggest at the outset that writers using paleolithic equipment like mine, check to see if their computers can generate PDF files. It will eliminate a lot of cussing later on.Other than THAT, I had a great time, learned a lot, and HIGHLY recommend the program. Wonderful teachers!~Jack Hayes ",0,1,Jack Hayes,22693258

27086521~COURSE!~K6ho2ngdEeWi0g6YoSAL-w,1526081372421,5,0,I really enjoyed the capstone.  I received some great feedback regarding my story but I was disappointed because most time I only received two instead of three reviews.  I feel the reviews are the most informative because they are the reader responses to the lessons covered each week so I think it should be a goal that is met each week even if a mentor must step in to provide that final review.The reviews are also an opportunity for me as a writer to improve my editing skills.  It is also an opportunity that forces me to make sure there is a positive in the critical reviews of the pieces.  I make sure i review my words to be sure they are not negative but offer guidance and words that will make the writers want to continue writing and improve.  As students we all came to this specialization for skills and a chance to publicly share those lessons within our pieces not negativity.I am glad Coursera provided me with this opportunity to take advantage of this specialization because I am a better writer because of these five courses and their instructors.
