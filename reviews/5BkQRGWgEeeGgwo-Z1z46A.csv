21804177~COURSE!~5BkQRGWgEeeGgwo-Z1z46A,1601909695000,1,0,"I've been trying to figure out how to enter the solutions that I get from the matrices, but every time I enter a matrix following the rules it gives me, it tells me this one tells me No Output.
Nor I have had a feedback on my questions and the stuff of the course is not very attentive to solving the doubts about it.",0,1,Edgar Andres Parra Ricaurte,21804177
47948228~COURSE!~5BkQRGWgEeeGgwo-Z1z46A,1584664434825,3,0,"Great Course, learned a lot, but the solutions to the quizzes or questions are not provided for many questions once the correct answer is selected for them. Someone could easily pass the quiz by guesswork without understanding the logic behind getting the answer. That is what happened with me for one of the questions. Without the solutions, I have no idea about the logic behind getting that answer and feel like I have still more to learn.",0,2,Huzefa Lightwala,47948228
16490622~COURSE!~5BkQRGWgEeeGgwo-Z1z46A,1549233526409,3,0,"Far too much focus on theory with little to now focus on application. The course in its current state is incomplete, adding on some realistic problems to convey the concepts would be better.Wrapping your head around all the wall of math and then answering theory questions with no link established to a real life examples makes the course ""difficult"". Meaning it could be made easier to understand but wasn't (not intentionally of course, just teaching style i guess).",0,2,Ashish Rana,16490622

81178224~COURSE!~5BkQRGWgEeeGgwo-Z1z46A,1623433614856,4,0," Solid course. The lectures complemented the chapters in the textbook well, each helped cover for some of the weak points of the other. I felt like the exams and projects were generally not challenging enough, and therefore does not push the student to understand the material past a surface level. From a coding perspective, the course provides you with a library that already does everything that you should instead be learning to do. I would have been more interested in creating some of these functions myself for the projects. I will say that the discussion topics were fantastic, and did push students to really question their understanding of a topic. I think the course could benefit from more questions like these.",0,0,Tommy Liang,81178224

36506141~COURSE!~5BkQRGWgEeeGgwo-Z1z46A,1552485232347,4,0,"The material is interesting. The videos could benefit by providing some bridging from theoretical to practical as some parts get too heavy into the math without really explaining to you what it means in the real world. There are some parts, such as the section on actuators, motors, etc that really start making you feel like your working on a robot. The peer graded assignments isn't the most effective method of evaluation as it all depends on the quantity of people enrolled in the course. Good course over all.",0,1,Chris Scarpelli,36506141
