1243680~COURSE!~pcU2JO5CEeyMkQqlZcADkQ,1672267931745,3,0,"The lectures are interesting and the instructors are knowledgeable. However, I found several cases where the quiz questions were worded incorrectly, were out of order, or had no valid choices. For example, a question about a topic that was covered in a subsequent video. In another case, the quiz answers did not apply to the question (e.g. a question on how to solve a problem, but the answers were only 'true' or 'false').I felt too the Python lectures were fairly fast-paced and in some cases included additional concepts that were not presented prior. It left me guessing and making assumptions to try and piece together the concepts.",0,0,Stephen Belknap,1243680
