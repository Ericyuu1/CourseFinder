found this course remarkably interesting and informative. It is a good
introductory course for someone who already has basic
technological knowledge and an understanding of basic math. I believe the
Course Information section underestimates the amount of time for the course. It
takes only 2-3 hours a week to attend the lectures (videos, reading, etc.) but
I would consider adding 1-2 hours on top that if you plan to study and learn
the material. (As with most educational endeavors.) It is a French
Language course with English subtitles, so it took a little extra reading on my
part to grasp the material, but the text translations are perfectly fine for
learning. I have one issue with the course which has to do with
the testing for each week. I found some of the questions confusing and
struggled to understand what was being asked for as some of the answers
appeared to be ""subjective"" rather than ""objective"" to the
material as presented in the videos. This may have been caused by something
missed in translation that I would have picked up on if I spoke French. Related
to the issue I had with testing is the fact that some questions
required calculating answers and no sample problems were provided during the
lectures. (This may be a difference in the education model (US) vs EU
[French].) I would recommend adding a text document that, at the
very least, shows sample calculations that relate to the test
problems and lectures (using different parameters of course). I think it would
greatly assist in learning the material.",0,0,Christopher Beck,799132
