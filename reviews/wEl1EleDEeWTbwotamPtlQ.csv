The professors don't even disclose that there are two opposing  historical schools: ""New Historians,"" whom Palestinians reference; and  traditional historians, favored by most Israelis. Which version is  followed here? The answer is a mix, without identification. This is not  the same as ""balance,"" which would entail each side laying out its key  points and evidence. As others note, there is zero reading material. One  wonders if this is because to choose a historian is to choose  sides--that is how divisive this topic is. The discussion forums are  also poorly monitored, unlike other Coursera courses; which does not advance understanding. ""A little knowledge is a dangerous thing"" unfortunately applies to this condensed intro course. And contrary to expectations for an offering from Tel Aviv U., most Israelis would likely be offended by some of its assertions/omissions. For example, Israelis recall that  Palestinian founding father Haj Amin al-Husseini was a Nazi agitator in  Europe and bequeathed an anti-Jewish ideology (Netanyahu even made a  speech about this in 2015 that was covered internationally). Yet in this  course, you will be told simply that al-Husseini was a ""man of religion.""",0,6,TF,3439999

16138787~COURSE!~wEl1EleDEeWTbwotamPtlQ,1456971006831,3,0,"Firstly i think for a coursera course it is not Long enough at all. There are not enough assignments which motivate studying and fixing the newly learned things in the memory. There are neither required nor recommended readings at all. For me reading is a very good Addition to the Videos so that you can slowly think about the thoughts and arguments. Especially in a topic which is undoubtly very controversal in public as in academia like especially the history of Israel and Palestine from the 30s onwards it is important to give different narratives of history to the students. There are no narratives critical to british colonialism at all mentioned, instead of the White paper of 1939. After all the course represents a very one sided an biased narrative which is presented to a global audience of students. Even if a certain narrative is preferred by the teaching scholars, which is completely acceptable and natural, not just in the field of history, it nevertheless is important to cover different narratives fairly and as neutral as possible, which does not happen in this course. When mentioned other narratives are quickly downplayed or denied, and repeatedly dichotomies like the ""inferior"" arabs, the ""ferocity"" of the arab oposition and so on are mentioned or cited without beeing problematized at all.

This became important when professor Naveb interview another person in Hebrew, as I found I could not really trust the subtitles.I think it wouldn't take much to make it an excellent course.My cheeky suggestion is to have a specialisation with The Emergence of the Modern Middle East by Professor Asher Susser as nucleus and a series of shorter, more in depth courses on certain of the bigger countries, such as Egypt, Turkey and Iran, similar to this one on Israel.",0,0,Stephen Henry,4147230
