107283201~COURSE!~YqhURwbHEey5zQ4LqE3elQ,1653404842414,1,0,"I absolutely do not recommend this course.

First of all, the tool presented is absolutely not the one used by the McKinsey firm.

Secondly, the concepts presented are outdated.

Finally, the presenter is mainly promoting his own firm, which is absolutely not McKinsey.

In short, I am very disappointed that Coursera presents such a low-quality and uninteresting course.",0,0,Ã‰ric Chapelle,107283201
