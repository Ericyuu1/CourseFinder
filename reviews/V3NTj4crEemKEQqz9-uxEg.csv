7489353~COURSE!~V3NTj4crEemKEQqz9-uxEg,1676664014374,2,0,"The course content was intriguing. However, it definitely needs updating. There are times where assignment instructions are incomplete, or there are discrepancies between what is shown in the lecture and what is in the notebooks. There are also times where what is in the assignment quizzes doesn't match up with the actual data in the assignment notebooks.I didn't get a lot out of some of the weeks, as it felt like the instructor was just reading word for word what was written in the notebooks, not adding any additional commentary or explanation. Furthermore, I wish they would have dove deeper into some of the statistics and math behind some of the concepts they showed. They would introduce a concept a lot of times, but not explain what it meant or how it related to other concepts we had learned.",0,0,Dan,7489353

There is a lot of ""copy/paste"" instruction, with almost no explanation of what is being done or why, at either the technical level (i.e. why are calling this function or method) or a the theoretical level (i.e. why a visualization or data interaction is useful).  It does touch on a many basic foundation for interacting with data (which is the only reason I'm not giving it 1 star), but from an actual instruction perspective, this the worst courses I have finished on Coursera.

Great course! The lectures focus on the hands-on application of analytics techniques; with slides of theory and math kept to a minimum. The quizzes are of easy to moderate difficulty, and help reinforce the concepts learnt in the lecture. The material of the course will be of interest to anyone who enjoys extracting insights from data, even if you aren't much of a sports fan. I’m excited for the next course in the specialization!",0,3,Robert Benbow,79703583
