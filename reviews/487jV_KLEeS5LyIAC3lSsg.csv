9014753~COURSE!~487jV_KLEeS5LyIAC3lSsg,1442459809372,5,0,"Organization of the class is clear and easy to follow. However, it might
 be better to place the Supplementary Readings after the Essential 
Readings for each unit. At times I would miss these required readings on
 the outline. Other times I would think they were required readings for 
the upcoming unit, when in actuality they were still part of the 
required readings for the previous unit. Most of the time, I come across
 the supplementary readings after the quiz has been taken. And when 
you're following the steps on the website the computer screen determines
 where you go once each step is completed. The quizzes at the end of 
each unit should be placed at the end of each unit.

I appreciate the ability to take quizzes at least three times and that 
you use the same quiz for each time it is retaken. Something I would 
change about the quizzes is, that the quizzes display the questions that
 were asked, instead of just marking with a green check mark or red X 
next to the number and the question that was asked, once the quiz has 
been submitted.

The videos and transcripts of those videos is very helpful. The videos are very clear and easy to understand. The content of the supplementary readings at times went over my head, but the content is both helpful and useful information.The due dates for each assignment was reasonable and flexible.

Aside from including the questions asked for each quiz after submission I
 would change your policy of establishing the honor code. When 
attempting to have my picture taken along with my ID to establish 
identification my head didn't quite line up with the Head Frame displayed
 on my screen and the button needed to be pressed in order to take the 
picture. The button was either not visible or the head shot frame was too
 high up.
I understand the need to establish  ones identity during online 
classes, but wouldn't it be better to create a electronic pledge for the
 students to agree to? One that would uphold and honor the Coursera 
Honor Code;
When someone is asked to type the same sentence repeatedly they're 
typing speed can increase because of the familiarity of that sentence. 
Also, the need to take more than one photo of the student before a quiz 
might make them feel uncomfortable. Especially, when the student is 
taking a quiz later in the day and may not exactly be ""picture really"".",0,1,Jessica Abson,9014753
