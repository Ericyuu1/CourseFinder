76613431~COURSE!~4qxpkeSHEeubuw5vhJdWSw,1646422379235,5,0,"The module of Week 1 is very helpful and interesting since it capture parts of Data Analysis knowledge and terms. In week 2, the concepts of different basic Machine Learning algorithms and models are also easy to understand, straightfully, not a 'wall of text' but concise theories and explanations. In week 3, they already provided the notebooks that you can run and investigate how they work on the jupyter environment of Azure. You also learn how to create a Azure compute resource that will be used to run the Machine Learning process. One of the drawback is that the Azure required such free trial subscription or a student account, so there might be cases that people find it difficult to create one or they have tried it before and the subscription has expired. But well this might be a rare occasion I believe. In overall, this is a wonderful course to help you engage with the foundation of Data Science and Machine Learning.",0,1,Anh-Tien Doan,76613431
