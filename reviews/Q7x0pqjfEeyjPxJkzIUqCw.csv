Very hard to understand and took a lot of extra steps just to figure out how to write a few lines of code the way they would accept it. (Example 1: Calories in a calorie tracker project were defined as being (x) calories/1 hour, but the project inputted (x) calories/30 mins.) (Example 2: Area calculator project defined a square with a width and height of 5 and checked for the answer of 20. {5X5 DOES NOT EQUAL 20.}) Overall the course honestly seemed like it was quickly made to be an easy cash grab for its price. Not worth it.",0,10,Sawyer Russell,88185430
