72517991~COURSE!~chzzNO6NEemjIRKsAX_xWg,1613340579648,1,0,"Pretty embarrassing for a Berklee course. The captions are full of errors, one video was filmed over Zoom with no professional backgrounds or lighting, and a number of quiz questions were literally impossible to answer because the videos preceding them hadn't provided the necessary information. There are nuggets of good info in here, but most of it feels disorganized and directionless. Would not recommend investing time or money in.",0,1,Socks Whitmore,72517991

39518935~COURSE!~chzzNO6NEemjIRKsAX_xWg,1603130529880,2,0,"The tutors are good and nice and I like the interviews. Unfortunately, the teaching materials and methods are a bit outdated. I don't know any musician that is working without a DAW. The handwritten arranging charts and absolutely (boring) standard instruments doesn't help to excite the listener anymore. Nowadays you should use way more electronic stuff in your songs and get the right groove and instruments with modern VSTs. Every DAW I know has the same basic functions so that there is no reason to ignore modern music producing and arranging methods. I also missed some extra or insider tips from the tutors experience. There are many YouTube channels that are more interesting and to the point for free.",0,1,Florian Grobe,39518935
47891291~COURSE!~chzzNO6NEemjIRKsAX_xWg,1664621965581,3,0,"T​his course is actually more of a masterclass, structured around conversations with music teachers and musicians.W​hile this could have been an interesting format, the quality of the content is uneven and remains a bit abstract . For example, it would have been useful to have more concrete case studies like the ed sheeran NYT video. All in all, I'm not sure it's worth the investment, unless you go through it at the back of studying Pat Pattison's 'Writing the Lyrics' and Scarlet Keys' 'Writing the Music' (both of which I strongly recommend).F​inally, the coursera UX for this course is outdated and cumbersome. And the peer-review system needs a complete overhaul.4​ stars for the course, minus one star for the substandard UX.",0,2,Sylvain L,47891291
48095144~COURSE!~chzzNO6NEemjIRKsAX_xWg,1600526353403,3,0,"On the positive note, the course had me tackle writing with  the Logic Pro X, but what I really need is a course on LogicPro, not how to add horns or violins to a song. The course seems to address rock musicians. I have much experience playing Blues and Jazz. The sensibility of these genres is very different.The course took me way longer than a few hours a week, as described in the weekly lessons. But that's due to my lack of knowledge with the software. I was rather disappointed as I found the videos self evident. I have a master's degree in music and I was expecting the content to be deeper. Now I understand that most songwriters are not theoreticians. I was mainly disappointed with the lack of support through the forum. Through the duration of the course, I entered many questions and never received answers or feedback. Only the final project was reviewed with ""add more instruments"". Which I had already done. To satisfy this request, I doubled a cello line with violins an octave higher. That would not be what I call positive feedback.  The music has its demands. Too much is the enemy of the good. But musicality and taste are definitely a matter of personal taste . II attempted to find out who had written this comment.  Was it from a student or the instructor? Anonymous feedback! It would seem facil to put out a few videos (that in itself is not easy) and let students grade each other with no input from instructors. Wish you had a course on Logic Pro X. I search but did not findI know I am very demanding and critical. Overall it was a rewarding experience. Thanks",0,2,Cecile Savage,48095144
