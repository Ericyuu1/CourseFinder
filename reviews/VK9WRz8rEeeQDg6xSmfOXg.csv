Perhaps I was mislead by the title as I was looking for some how-to with specific instructional technologies.  This course did not offer that at all, its all about theory and case studies.",0,5,Amy Mich,21733629

84918932~COURSE!~VK9WRz8rEeeQDg6xSmfOXg,1632379941424,3,0,"I loved learning the content of this course. It is the first MOOC I have taken so the peer feedback system was a bit to get my head around, and I'm sceptical of the legitimacy of some of the feedback given the lack of accountability. However, I really enjoyed learning the concepts in a flexible manner. I note that there was no support from any course administrators given in the discussion forums.",0,0,Kimberley Young ,84918932

31805356~COURSE!~VK9WRz8rEeeQDg6xSmfOXg,1608113961578,4,0,"  Dr.William Cope and Dr.Mary Kalantzis have successfully orchestrated this course with the assistance of brilliant professors. Recent and very relatable knowledge and information on the future of learning using technology. The variety of topics and the specialty focused /innovation approach by all contributors, authors and researchers who participated in the program is remarkable. Moreover, Peer review and Discussion boards made a great assessment method, allowing me and thousand of learners around the world to share our knowledge and have not only theory but implementation focused conversations.the fifth point is not given because of the lack of moderator support and response in the course, I understand the challenge around this ,  given this is a mooc course and have thousands of learners, but a small present of a moderator here and their would be nice and create a more engaging and collaborative course.

60563344~COURSE!~VK9WRz8rEeeQDg6xSmfOXg,1593846269593,4,0,"There are some confusion with using the platform to facilitate discussions. There are some peers who have duly completed their assignments but did not do so in the format required which makes it hard for them to get a grade or to be reviewed. Additionally, the choice to complete the course either on Scholar or Coursera platform may have caused a split of users between two platforms and hence slow to receive reviews. I would hope some clarifications can be made to improve the instructions so that peers will also be able to complete this course.",0,3,"Goh Siang Hwee, Elston",60563344
