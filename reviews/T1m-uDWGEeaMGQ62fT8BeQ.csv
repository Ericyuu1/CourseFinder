Readings are either broken or a decade old. They don't touch on the readings at all
The instructor says ""um"" constantly
Video needs editing
The course title is Intro to Social media analytics.. ignores qunatitative metrics, quickly goes to blogs and review sites. Then jumps to some research he did . It gets off topic so fast. 
He doesn't illustrate much of what he is saying
Basically reads the slides, doens't add much. ",0,0,Scott Connery,117124300
