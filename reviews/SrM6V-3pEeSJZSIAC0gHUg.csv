38533334~COURSE!~SrM6V-3pEeSJZSIAC0gHUg,1657964715401,1,0,"T​his course would be very good but it seems like it was hastely put together and a little disorganized. It is nearly impossible to get the peer-reviewed work done on time for two reasons: 1.) the instructions are vague and not explained well. It is hard to determine what is needed in length and content, the rubric is also lacking in direction. 2.) when people post in the discussion forum asking for people to review their work, it gets deleted by mentors, therefore, numerous people have late assignments because there has been no peer-reviewed work done. Sometimes it can take weeks or months to get an assignment peer-reviewed for a grade to be able to move on.

*EDIT*
The course certificate doesn't even display the course leader's (or professor's) name to justify itself; its just a scribble with a smiley face. It doesn't even look serious. 

This course could be much better than it already is but for right now it seems more like a cash-grab than anything. ",0,0,Joseph Jensen,38533334

The moderator (Dave) was passionate about his subject and quite knowledgeable. I will be VERY careful in the future though and NEVER take a Coursera class that includes peer review. I and obviously many others had issues with ""peers"" giving our work poor marks with no explanation and which did not match other's feelings who scored us. Ones score is almost entirely dependent on peers opinions and not the instructors. This was unreliable and unprofessional. I very much appreciated the help of Sue on a number of occasions but there was only so much she could do.

This course started with a review on positive psychology and its relationship to education, focusing on ""Growth Mindset"", ""Grit"" , and other character traits related to academic success.  It presented some very clear advice for teachers wishing to encourage success by rewarding effort and simple hard work in the classroom.  Teaching isn't easy and many students become discouraged.  I thought that one of the best things about this course was the idea that even simple changes in the teacher's wording of a response or in his/her facial expressions might impact a student's attitude about success in the classroom.  Beyond this, many academic lessons can be combined with relevant character lessons such that students benefit with increased motivation and less fear of failure.",0,0,Ellen Freed,52480448
