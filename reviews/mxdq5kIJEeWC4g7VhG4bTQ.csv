There is so much detail and explanation about the statistics and concepts behind how it works, but there is hardly ever an actual lesson on the code used or needed to implement the algorithms. When trying to fumble my way through the code, I found, on several occasions, the code in the self-directed lessons to be incomplete (I'm referring to pieces of code that were obviously meant to be there, but were missing), causing hours and hours of anguish and turmoil. I feel like there should be a lot more time spent on the actual coding and learning how to implement it within the code (similar to the 1st course), rather than spending an exuberant amount of time going through derivations and no time on actual coding and how to implement it within the programming language. If you are a software designer/engineer or programmer, then you should be fine as long as you pay attention to the very long lessons and derivations and can fix the broken code that you are given. There are other mistakes within the quizzes as well, which make them near impossible to pass. For example, it is unclear which model you need to use to calculate in order to get the correct square foot.

Instead of being tested on the material just learned, it seemed like the objective was to learn to decode test questions.2 and the most glaring omission, was that when students are asked to provide functions, only some are provided with a follow up test to ensure the function is working properly.  If the output is syntactically correct but provides incorrect output then you're moving forward blindly after that.  Then add the quiz questions from problem One above, and you're just wasting your time after that and building up frustration.  Validating your code as you move along seems like a pretty rudimentary process to impart to students and when the teachers don't practice it themselves, there are bound to be problems.I like the intent of the course, and considering my outsider background to computer science, the mathematics etc, I did learn a fair bit.

innovative modules. The course was swift was not too rapid and steady I 
would definitely recommend this course for the aspirant who is looking 
for a head start in the machine learning career. I might have a 
suggestion for the mentors that the course python notebook is not up to

Everything is explained so clearly and well-balanced between practical understanding vs underlying theory. Definitely serves as a good review for those of us who are looking to get back into machine learning!",0,0,Joseph Kim,1581486

In general, I found the course to be very interesting and an excellent introduction to building predictive models . Particularly , i appreciate the way mathematical formulations was explained to carry along beginners in this areas. Nonetheless, I would suggest that the general notation slide in week 2 should include concrete data example in a table to explain the notations ie. x[j], xi[j], etc",0,0,Ahmed Adeniran,13418719
