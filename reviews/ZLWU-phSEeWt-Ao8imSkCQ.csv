70761474~COURSE!~ZLWU-phSEeWt-Ao8imSkCQ,1604353726688,4,0,Excellent Course. In my view the main skill you gain from this course is learning how to read given python programs and use them in your own project. I found this course more difficult than i expected though.

POC1 is challenging and takes significant time to complete. You will struggle at times.  One recommendation I have if they ever re-work the course, make the project descriptions more clear.  I wasted most of the time trying to interpret the instructions or re-doing my work after realizing I interpreted it wrong.  I honestly believe I would have complete the projects in less time if they simply showed me a working copy of the final program and instructed to re-create it.  Trying to work from code snippets that someone else wrote is a hinderance if instructions are unclear.  It's difficult to jump into the middle of someone else's thought process.  For those of you thinking of taking this course, I say go for it as long as you have time and are mentally prepared to struggle through portions.

It taught me the importance of efficiency on a small scale, and I became mindful of efficiency early on with further assignments. This is a great habit to pick up early on.My only trouble with the course is that if one's code is too inefficient, Owltest will not grade the assignment.

12971830~COURSE!~ZLWU-phSEeWt-Ao8imSkCQ,1518038936867,4,0,"I'll start by saying that PoC Part 1 is a good course. I took it after completing IIPP Parts 1 and 2. If you are coming from IIPP, you'll find the organization of PoC familiar: there are weekly lectures, a few practice problems, a quiz, and a mini-project. I found this course far more difficult than either of IIPP offerings. In part this is unavoidable since the concepts are more complex and the problems students are asked to solve are correspondingly more challenging. The course introduces various mathematical/statistical concepts that are useful in programming. I had to spend time elsewhere online reviewing these concepts. If you are not familiar with the concepts, I suspect you'll have to do the same as the professors spend little time explaining them. As for the coding: if you took IIPP, you'll know that the professors provided a step-by-step guide for the mini-projects. For the most part, these guides have been jettisoned in PoC. Unless you have programming experience beyond IIPP, you'll likely have a hard time writing the required programs. The only programming experience I had was IIPP, and I found the programming problems in PoC difficult. But at the same time I am a much better programmer now because I was forced to learn lots of stuff on my own in order to get my mini-projects right (I spent lots of time on coding forums and reading through the official Python documentation). If you take PoC after IIPP, you'll also find that the quizzes (now called homework) may well take a considerable amount of time to complete when compared to IIPP. One annoying thing on these quizzes is the ""test case"" question at the end: the professors ask students to find test cases to check for bugs in various programs. This is doubtless an important skill, but they spent almost no time discussing methods for developing test cases, and if you get the question wrong on the quiz, you'll never know what the correct answer is and hence you don't really learn much from your mistake. Overall, I learned a lot and enjoyed the projects. As I say, PoC is more challenging than IIPP. I enjoyed the class enough that I've just enrolled in PoC Part 2.",0,4,Jeremy Ledger,12971830

For me, there was a quite a step up and early on I was getting out of my depth and actually in the end did not finish the course.  In hindsight (and actually what I am doing down to re-enroll) I would go and gain much more experience of Classes (they play a major part, and I am thinking or writing all the games as classes that I built in IIPP) and work through the Math Preparation to prepare.
