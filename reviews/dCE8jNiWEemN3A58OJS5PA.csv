81986285~COURSE!~dCE8jNiWEemN3A58OJS5PA,1620341824687,2,0,"Discussions and assignments did not go very deep, I was looking more specifically for tools and language to develop my music lessons with beginners, but this seemed to focus more on how to bring the cultural education into lessons of students with musical background. My experience in music education is consistent with that mission, but I'm more interested in the 'how' part of that question than I am in the 'why'. Also I did not enjoy the process of peer reviewed marking because I found that I got unhelpful feedback. In fact, I had to resubmit my assignment to get a different grade on the final assignment to pass. I completed the course work in 2 weeks but it's now taken 9 weeks for the course to complete.   Pros of the course however, good quality content, easy to follow lessons, and the jazz improv discussion group is a cool addition. ",0,0,Eric Clifford Seeley,81986285
