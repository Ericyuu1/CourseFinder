26391357~COURSE!~9wSqaVu-EeWPXA4vXFBIfw,1557795245187,2,0,"Its a good course and I learnt a lot. However, the TAs are totally not responsive and there is absolutely no help from the mentors and TAs. Also, there are some bugs in the code provided which makes it hard to debug errors. Also, DO NOT take a AR track. The grade for AR track depends on how many are currently enrolled in the course which is not in your control. The grade is provided when the fellow students grade your submissions and vice-versa. This can be frustrating if you are the only one in the course. I finished the AR track and then waited for 1 month anticipating a grade. I finally started the MIP track and finished it to get my certificate. ",0,1,Abhi Sirimamilla,26391357

10963852~COURSE!~9wSqaVu-EeWPXA4vXFBIfw,1585043626360,4,0,Controller tuning is the hard part in the MIP track. All rest is manageable. But It teaches you how real projects can become challenging. ,0,0,Hussain Ali,10963852

19857986~COURSE!~9wSqaVu-EeWPXA4vXFBIfw,1484825234319,4,0,"This is it! This was the last course in the Robotics Specialization. I must say this was the most interesting course in this specialization, there are 2 tracks available to choose from: a software one and a hardware one. Needless to say I chose the latter. I think pretty much anyone doing a robotics specialization should opt for this one if they have the means. It is nice to simulate different scenarios and learn different concepts through them, however, nothing beats the joy of building something by yourself and witnessing the fruits of your hard work, it is really rewarding!My main and only complaint about this course is related to the grading system for the hardware track. It relies on a system of peer reviews by 3 other students. Sometimes the results might not be fair, and you will need to resubmit your work because of that.",0,0,Eduardo Konishi de Souza,19857986
30474941~COURSE!~9wSqaVu-EeWPXA4vXFBIfw,1617995193849,5,0,"I really enjoyed this capstone. It was the most challenging especially since I took the AR track but it was also the most rewarding. The forums were very helpful and the staff responded well to my queries. However, I think this course is due for an upgrade. The raspberry pi image still incorporates Python 2.7 and a dated ROS version. The IMU recommended by the course is quite out of fashion and more modern and precise IMUs are not supported by the course codes and this presented a huge challenge to me. In summary, the course is awesome and I am glad I completed this specialization.",0,0,David Akhihiero,30474941
74119482~COURSE!~9wSqaVu-EeWPXA4vXFBIfw,1615487644335,5,0,It is a very good end for the program. With an integration of all the adquired knowledge.The hardest part for me was the Kalman Filter lessons. I think you can leave a lot more information about this topic that became very important in the last phase of the project. ,0,0,Erick Alejandro Mancera Davila,74119482

11508914~COURSE!~9wSqaVu-EeWPXA4vXFBIfw,1513637484229,5,0,"Most of the modules are very practical in nature. Some of the modules focused on the research being done at the moment, which can make them look like more abstract, i.e. not so practical, but I think it is good to see what the future will bring. The capstone project helps a lot really fix the concepts in the mind of the student.Sometimes the grading system could be more friendly, e.g.: provide more clues as to what is not working fine in the assignments.The communication with the instructors is rather slow. I know that the idea is the interaction with peers should compensate for the virtual presence and the distance between students and instructors, but sometimes the peers have the same questions and concerns, so student might need the help from the instructors in a timely manner.

It is possible to choose between the modelling and control of a two-dimensional Segway in Matlab or the creation and control of a robot rover. I picked the first module and it proved to be very interesting. The lectures are few and very clear, with most of the time dedicated to the development of the project. For once, the assignments were also clear! Excellent course!",0,0,Enrico Anderlini,11677749
23308989~COURSE!~9wSqaVu-EeWPXA4vXFBIfw,1497366701250,5,0,I followed the MIP track since the AR track required me to purchase a kit and it was quite expensive. I would like to make the bot with custom parts once i have acquired the needed ones. The MIP track was good involving all that we learnt from previous courses and building up our ability to code.,0,0,Ramachandran Seetharaman,23308989
