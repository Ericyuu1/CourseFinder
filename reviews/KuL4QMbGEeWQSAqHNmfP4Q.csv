73757257~COURSE!~KuL4QMbGEeWQSAqHNmfP4Q,1663910928360,1,0,"T​he worst course I've ever taken!!!!! Don't wast your time unless you are very rich and have nothing to do. They asked 5 peer revview to pass the course for each project, and they force you to read the optional material otherwise you can't pass the quiz. They only test the hardest part in the quiz to keep you as long as you can in each course so that they can earn money. Anyone see this PLEASE RUN AWAY FROM THIS WORST COURSE!!!!

22805075~COURSE!~KuL4QMbGEeWQSAqHNmfP4Q,1636569550403,5,0,"I​ started learning computer science and just programming in general through this course. I think it's one of the best introductions one can have into learning these skills. The fun little games and programs one can build in the first part of the 6 modules really get you motivated and interested in what you can do. As for the second part where the math and logic gets more complex I have to say, even though I'm not particularly good at either of these, the professors do a wonderful job at making it all palatable and digestible for everyone. I can highly recommend doing this specialization and I'm thankful for having this opportunity.",0,0,Márton András Nemeskéri,22805075
29529326~COURSE!~KuL4QMbGEeWQSAqHNmfP4Q,1609880440512,5,0,"Hands down, this specialization is the best on Coursera.  It is a true zero-to-hero program of study that takes you from knowing nothing to a confident programmer by the end. The Capstone Exam reminds you of how much you have learned.  I want to thank the professors, Joe, Scott and Luay for all the work (and love) they have put into this specialization.  It really shows.  I am honored to have been one of your students and will miss learning from you.  I had a blast!",0,0,Peyman Pakzaban,29529326

63667458~COURSE!~KuL4QMbGEeWQSAqHNmfP4Q,1601050658038,5,0,Amazing end to the whole specialization. The instructors are amazing with lots of character and clearly explained a lot of the difficult concepts. Overall this is a great course and helped me learn a lot.,0,1,Muhammad Arief Musa,63667458
34424540~COURSE!~KuL4QMbGEeWQSAqHNmfP4Q,1596506828124,5,0,"A friend of mine recommended this specialization to me. It took me over half a year to complete, but I'm glad I stuck out. This specialization is great for people who don't have much background in computer science. It started with building small games, and developed into more advanced topics of data structure and algorithm. The instructors are easy to follow, and if you don't understand something, you can always rewind the video and re-watch it. The forum is also a good resource to seek answer to your questions. By the time I finished the specialization, I have gained a much deeper understanding of programming compared to when I started it, and prepared me for further study in this field.",0,3,Xinxia Zou,34424540

45937032~COURSE!~KuL4QMbGEeWQSAqHNmfP4Q,1583774472804,5,0,This is the best specialization for aspiring beginners: it does not cut slacks but constantly pushes you to become better and better! I have just finished a machine learning MOOC and realized that many of the things I learned from this course (esp. algorithmic thinking) are highly related! The specialization really prepares you well as you go further.,0,1,Thomas Li,45937032

10473069~COURSE!~KuL4QMbGEeWQSAqHNmfP4Q,1554966199126,5,0,Challenging ending to this great specialization (highly recommended)! Make sure you are prepared prior to starting the exam -- if you haven't been paying attention or putting work into the previous courses you will most likely not make it through the exam.,0,4,Max Bredford,10473069

6589768~COURSE!~KuL4QMbGEeWQSAqHNmfP4Q,1513755211815,5,0,The exam had good questions and was not overly difficult after taking the other classes. I spent 7.5 hours on it and passed in first try despite making a few dumb mistakes like entering results in wrong format etc. It is possible to retake as many times as you want but there is a 3 day delay and they say questions change quite a lot.,0,1,Michael Brandt Rasmussen,6589768

12402517~COURSE!~KuL4QMbGEeWQSAqHNmfP4Q,1473271621361,5,0,Loved this specialization.  My only complaint is that I became very attached to many of the other students in my cohort and I felt that this course did not give me adequate closure.  We kinda needed an end of course virtual party. :),0,1,Dustin Helliwell,12402517
15854114~COURSE!~KuL4QMbGEeWQSAqHNmfP4Q,1464637467244,5,0,"This specialization has been nothing short of awesome. This exam really caps it off on a high note. Not only the quizzes were challenging and interesting, they are also very relevant to all the concepts learnt throughout the specialization. The exam consists of a good mix of conceptual, algorithmic, debugging, optimization problems, graph modelling and mathematical computation problems. The very tight time frame of only a few weeks with only 1 single attempt each week forced me to be very careful with my solutions and double check my work carefully before submitting. The only thing that I wish to see is that this exam should be 2 exams instead of just 1 exam. I sort of still hunger for more challenging exercises like this exam. I really hope that this capstone exam course sets a good example for other Coursera courses because challenging mini-exams like this are incredibly valuable tools to validate our knowledge.",0,1,Huynh Long Do,15854114
