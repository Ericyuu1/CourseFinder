116195626~COURSE!~-cGp-5AdEeizBwo4yno0fA,1676670556949,2,0,"This course was attempting to cover way  too much.  It both was trying to address dementia from the patient 's  and care-giver's perspectives, and at the same time  address  several much-larger context perspectives.  from a the administrative, the sociological and political, so it seemed to be very much longer than other similar Coursera courses..  It was not only unnecessarily fragmented in its focus, but intolerably fragmented in its presentation; most segments were 3-4 minutes long, some less than a minute.  I wanted to quit countless times because this bits-and-pieces structure was so frustrating and infuriating.  Having said that, that I appreciate that the presenters were very well intentioned and have the dementia sufferers and care-givers firmly in their sights to provide asssitance, support and encouragement for the workfor the well-being of thos wo suffer from dementia.
