4076350~COURSE!~5UGFRKUVEeStrCIACxCS_Q,1479591211830,4,0," I think some very tough choices were made to fit the course online.  It is a successful course, but you can tell that a more in depth version of the course would probably be exciting.  You would certainly go further, if you were enrolled at Chapel Hill, and had a couple semesters to contemplate the topic.  The instructor is a person who made his own videos and recordings of local storytellers, artists and musicians over a long period of time.   You can tell he is a very active collector of local lore.   So, he tries to feature this material, sensibly.  Some of this material you was great.On the other hand; the knowledge of the course is really only a beginning to what could be learned.   For example, when mentioning the photographers or painters of the South, you are not able to see a large number of their pictures.  Likewise, when talking about the major writers, such as Faulkner, you do not get to read many longer excerpts of their work.  This course provides the names to reference; starting points for further study. The instructor trusts you to investigate these resources on your own.",0,0,Shelton Deverell,4076350
