35923789~COURSE!~jZVi525OEeW8nw5ORrHGtQ,1583600857430,4,0,"Again, great course - I was a little bit shaky on the Ruby, but to be honest this was my first real dive into what OOP is ""really like"" (as far as I can tell). I was also impressed by how certain important concepts from Part B were also tested towards the end (e.g., streams).  I also enjoyed the material on subtyping towards the end; it makes you actually want to be interested in implementing a small language like that someday. The only caveat I must mention (and what the missing star is due to) is that, I had a little trouble on my Linux machine getting a version of Tcl/Tk to work with my installation of Ruby, since Ruby doesn't accept the latest (packaged) version of Tcl/Tk. I also had trouble with Jruby, and in the end opted to manually install older versions of Tcl and Tk. But I think the Tetris experience was worth it :) That whole little sidetrack actually also turned me on to the possibility of how PLs use graphics libraries in general, so let's see where that leads...

I have Masters in Computer Science and overall experience with different programinng languages aroung 10 years. 5 of wich is full-time job of enterprise programming. Having all that this course still was completely awesome I had enourmous amount of fun taking it. I elarn plenty of new stuff and for most of the key parts I finally got a clear precise definition of things I already new but it was more intuitive without actual scientific explanation.
Dan is an awesome lecturer he is plesand and fun to listen too. I would recomend this course to anyone who wan't to susm up their knowledge. I had no problems with homeworks but there still was couple of chalenges, i think It might be a bit hard to complete for a novices.
