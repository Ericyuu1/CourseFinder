While the material discussed shows complexity, it often times seems more like it's own lesson and not about the complexity topic being discussed.  I often had to fight to relate the material back to the actual course topic due to the examples being too specific.  If you aren't familiar with biology/atomic structures, then the lesson is easily lost due to the chosen example.  First lesson in communicating is to know your audience, examples should be relatable to everyone.",0,2,Jeffrey Thompson,61400540

What I found with this course was that many of the Big History themes are repeated, that part is OK. But the the subject specific videos felt like ""here's a summary of this topic and why its complex"" and what I was expecting was ""here's the challenges in this area and this is how complexity theory is being applied and what it might mean"". The exception was the economics lecture in week 5 which did link back to complexity theory being applied to economics. Week 6 brought things together to some extent. It is the first course in a specialization but many of the videos didn't meet my expectation. ",0,3,Neil Harper,2863928

The term 'Big History' and its content is new to me but it was a great introduction. The videos and extra resources (readings, videos, audios) add a lot of extra value to the course.
