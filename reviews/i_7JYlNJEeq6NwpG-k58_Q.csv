As such, it is an ideal course for an experienced programmer who is new to Python, but not to programming or computer science. Or, as a review/refresher for those who previously took a Python course and looking to strengthen what they've already been taught.I​ took this having already taken Python courses elsewhere (namely, the ""Python For Everybody"" courses offered on Coursera here through U-Michigan). It goes through the same material, but in a more substantive way.T​HE BAD:  While the instructor was clear, it merely goes through the syntax of Python - basically how it works. It doesn't go into WHY or the underlying framework for computer programming (that transcends Python). As such, if you are new to computer programming, you'll be even more lost. But if you've got some programming background, this may be for you.T​HE BAD #2: The course is structured and paced very poorly. Each ""week"", you watch a ton of 30 sec - 2 min videos, where the instructor *blazes* through a ton of material.  The weekly quizzes are typical of Coursera (multiple choice, mostly recall, not challenging).  And then just *one* monster assignment to end the week.T​he problem with this approach is they throw you a bunch of new concepts (in tiny 1 min videos), and then expect you to put it all together in one monster assignment. It's like explaining to someone very quickly all the components of a car, and then expecting you to fix it all in one go. Or showing someone a list of vocabulary for a foreign language, then some rules of grammar, and then BOOM - expecting to write an essay in one go.T​he more effective way of learning is cumulative - building one idea on top of the other. That deepens understanding. 

This course instead feels more like a Python cram course for those who already know it and need a refresher.T​HE BAD#3: The validation checks for the weekly assignments are done poorly. It seems configured in a way where there is just *one* way to reach the result, and you need to do it that *one* way. This is actually bad practice because in the real world, there are often multiple ways to code something to get the same result, each with their benefits and tradeoffs. Learning that there are often multiple ways to get the same result is essential, which this grading system does not account for. 

SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT:1​. Smaller, more frequent, mini-assignments that focus on a subset of the ideas being taught, rather than one monster assignment each week. This will also encourage more people to continue and learn, while being more effective in allowing students to accumulate concepts.2​. If the lectures are as they are (Penn isn't re-recording these again), then have Coursera re-label this as ""Mixed"" or ""Intermediate"". This is an intro to Python, but it's not a ""beginner"" course. ",0,29,Alex Chu,9139826
82706813~COURSE!~i_7JYlNJEeq6NwpG-k58_Q,1621201912872,2,0,"I considered this couse because of Penn's reputation. Since this is a subset of the Introduction to Python and Java course, they only do things that are complementary in both languages. As an example, they always use for loops instead of teaching about list iterators. This does not give you a full flavor for Python. Also, the toolsets are a little outdated. If you are teaching a course on Java and Pythion, you probably should be using a tool like VSCode to be doing all the code by examples.Final evaluation project had two bugs in the assignments. For example, the description for the change_password function has the following ""The user is logged in (the username is associated with the value False in the log_in dictionary)"". The only way to get the assignment to Succeed was to test for True, not False"". Also had a bug on the delete_account tests.

I also thought it was very strange and simply frustrating. I guess the coding itself would have been doable, but I wasted so much time trying to figure out WHAT exactly they wanted from me. If I wrote different codes that worked, it was still wrong because it was not what their automated system was testing. I get that, but then at least the instructions should not be confusing and contradictory. When I asked a question in the forum, after 1-2 days they would respond to only the one error message I'd have and once I fixed that specific error, I would get new error messages, would have to ask again, wait, etc. It took me 2-3 weeks instead of the supposed 4 hours and I spent almost one full course payment on this.

Also, there isn't much interaction in the forums when I repeadly asked pernate questions in the community as directed by the instructor. I wish there were more peer to peer interaction as that would be very helpful in application of running Python Code. My advice is to audit the class, and copy and paste the transcripts then print them. The pdf's offered were small in size and can hardly be read, very impractal for class work. Also, the pdf's took up way too much ink and toner. I highly recommend getting a laser jet monacrome printer as they last longer and won't cost an arm and a leg to print in the long run because toner lasts forever before it needs to be replaced. Brother lasor printers are awsome for this class. Also, I highly recommend writing down notes, yes it's old school but it'll greatly improve grasping the concepts that are covered in the class.

This goes true for the code along demonstrations as well where I hope more instructions could focus on why we are doing it this way, or why we are choosing this particular function/data structure etc. I find the instructor mostly reading what's already in the comments line which are accessible by student-reading itself.I also think it will be useful for the instructor to introduce the use of the flow chart when developing a program. I find it the most challenging thing in completing the homework - not the programming syntax itself - but rather than the design of the flow of the program, which was simply not mentioned much in the course.There are also a few discrepancies in the last assignment that took my a lot of time to debug. Requirements (e.g. to check if the user is logged in in the 'change_password' function, and to delete the user in the 'bank dictionary' as well as the 'log_in' dictionary in the 'delete' function, etc.) were not mentioned in the directions under the functions. I could only debug by learning to read the test case lines. It would be nice if every requirement is stated explicitly, as they are mostly in other parts of the course.

This course, however,  lacks one crucial element--solutions to assignements after you've completed the minimum to pass them. Why is that important? There are 2 reasons. 1. Even if the job of a programmer is to find out what's wrong with the code using the internet + trial and error, the job of a course is to teach us how to think about code and improve our thinking, which this course doesn't do. 2. There are multuple ways of solving each problem. Say, the student figures out one or two of them, but not the one which is required by the testing mechanism. The problem occurs when the next assignment requires you to use the solution that you haven't come up with. Then you start the next task with gaps in your knowldge that could be easily filled by the course creators.O​verall I don't mind the testing mechanism. It is designed to check for corner cases, so I do like the idea of adjusting my code so that it withstands all tests.

My worry is that if you don't already know most of the material, it comes at you too fast for it to really stick.  I​ find the quizzes really easy.  The exercises are difficult.  I found the last assignment in the fourth week to be absolutely miserable.  The exercise asks you to build a banking system, but it requires you to define large numbers of overly complicated functions.  Pseudocode directions are provided to help, but it's just so much at once that it's really hard.  It is passable, but it is really difficult and probably needlessly so.  I probably spent more time working on the final assignment than I spent on the entire course prior to that.  I think that's kind of ridiculous. The same material could be broken up into smaller exercises and it would be a lot less daunting.
