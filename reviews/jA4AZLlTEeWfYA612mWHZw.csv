That is a repeated cycle. Say something is due then assignment asking for it to be posted. Next, there is no response to posted questions on the discussion forum.

They didn't explain the difference between wordpress.com and wordpress.org even though they mentioned them both. They talked about hosting but didn't explain how to do it. They mentioned hosting on bluehost but didn't give any instructions. The few tidbits of information that they did give about using wordpress were so brief with no examples. They mentioned Jetpack but didn't say what it was. They didn't explain what benefit adding the social media icons would have or how to link them. And on I could go.

Nothing in this ""course"" actually told me how to do anything.  In the end, I downloaded a book for $10 and learned WordPress on my own during my ""weekend"" website creation.  It took a few more days to test 10 Themes but eventually I made it through.  As to the peer review process, that is a total sham.  It simply means two women (one, with doctoral degree in music!) put their names to this project to pad their CVs.  All while the students are left to float in limbo waiting desperately for other students to ""grade"" their submissions.  For every three-star student work, there were at least three that were woefully ridiculous: no links, links to Wikipedia, links to catalogs, etc.  And all the while, the person actually waiting for a real peer review waits and waits.  Back in the day, I worked for the State University of New York; creating a graphic arts department in the Central Administration before computers became a common site on anyone's desktop.  I was appalled that SUNY's name was associated with this course.  The only reason I gave two and not one star was because the nine steps presented the ""how to"" in correct order.  For some students, that might have been helpful in itself:  organizing one's thoughts, doing a story board, etc.  Being a stubborn person, once I paid my $29, I finished the course because it amused me to do so and I empathized with other students needing peer reviews to complete the course.
