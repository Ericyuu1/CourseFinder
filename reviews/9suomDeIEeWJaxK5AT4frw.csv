4789705~COURSE!~9suomDeIEeWJaxK5AT4frw,1464266227306,1,0,"This capstone project is a bad joke and I'm gonna tell you why!First, ESSEC TAs were never available! We had to contact Coursera several times for weeks to get a simple yet not helpful reply from ESSEC. And it was too late for anything, really... Remember, the whole project lasts for 4 weeks only!Second, several documents required for the weekly assignments were missing! It's fair to say we were all free-styling (i.e. making wild assumptions) our ways through the entire capstone due to lack of necessary information. Third (and most importantly). most of the participants didn't have any basic business background whatsoever. Be prepared to get a bad grade from someone who's clueless about hotel business, not to mention revenue or demand management. That really makes you wonder how these people even passed the last three core courses....Forth, this capstone is great for those who just want to get a certificate for the sake of having a certificate. Did you notice those 4 or 5 star ratings with no written reviews? Yeah, they were probably trying to show their appreciation for the easy certificate. After all, it's easy to walk away with a decent grade when there's no one knows what's going on. ANYTHING GOES! However, if you are a serious learner who wants to actually learn something, run away from this capstone. You will be thanking me later.All in all, a horrible experience and I wish I could get those 4 weeks of my life back! ",0,6,Benjamin Chao,4789705

4604595~COURSE!~9suomDeIEeWJaxK5AT4frw,1558344506826,5,0,"PROSPeter O'Connor is a very knowledgeable industry veteran. So reading his articles on the industry is a great base to work from.Lucky to get a great set of students who I could learn from through grading their assignments and their feedback on mine.Most of the ESSEC material was easy to understand and work through.CONSUnlike University setting that I had gone through there is no professor to tell you if you are wrong or right. Students can, but they are like me and you here to learn.Some of the material was outdated and needs revision.There are plagiarizers just like in any institution. Perhaps insecure about their Linked in status and need a certificate. Overall, like with all the Coursera courses, it is what you put in and get out of it that will matter.I certainly have learned a lot, not enough to land me a job but to appreciate my peers and industry professionals like Peter O'Connor.Thanks Coursera for making this possible.",0,2,Neil Marcello,4604595
