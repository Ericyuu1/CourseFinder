76750124~COURSE!~WoKAt-HiEeeNUAqowLUc1g,1611167268076,4,0,"The course showed me so much new and well presented information about the vast topic of sustainable development. Some of the presentation videos, especially the speakers and transscribed texts made it a little hard or to follow. Sometimes I couldn't find the recommended paragraphs after answering wrong in a quiz because the names were different from the actual paragraph name. SDGs remain a recent topic, so the implementation of more recent data and statistics in some fields would be desirable. 
 So all in all there were a few issues but I'm sure you'll be able to enhance that.
