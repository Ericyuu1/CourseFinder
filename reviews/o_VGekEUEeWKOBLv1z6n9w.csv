25120357~COURSE!~o_VGekEUEeWKOBLv1z6n9w,1501339801663,1,0,"For a course on art and archaeology, there seemed to be little shown. More time was spent with Dr. Soren sitting behind a desk or standing at an empty site, usually reading off the teleprompter. This course lends itself to a lot of visuals, yet that part of the course was very skimpy. And why the old movie trailers? Why did we see a whole video on Troy? This isn't even Roman, beyond the fact that several emperors likened themselves to Alexander and some Hellenistic art influence. That's not what the video referenced. Again, it was just about the discovery of Troy, historical, with no attempt to make it relevant to the course itself. I know some historical background is needed to keep the work in context, but this was more of a history class than an art-based one. And as much as I love dogs, was that really necessary?

Answers to quizzes are wrong, and although students reported this months ago, no corrections have been made.Professor is on camera much more than necessary and many of the images provided are not the best.  Significant errors-- e.g. professor says that the Roman colosseum seated 20,000 while most scholars put the number closer to 50,000.  His dog gets more air time than the Pantheon. He shows clips from fictional films such as Gladiator that have only marginal relation to the course.  Very little about archaeology is presented-- although the underwater segment and the one on trees were good.  But no mention of aerial surveillance or ground penetrating radar.  Barely anything about the traditional ""dig.""  This course needs a major overhaul.  Much better Coursera  course is Roman Architecture by Prof. Diana Kleiner from Yale.  It's harder.
