This course gave me a basic understanding of the history of Ukraine and has instilled in me a desire to pursue more reading in depth with the fine and thorough bibilography.   The lectures were excellent and I was pleased that I could return and re-read the text, timeline and glossary.  I appreciated being able to view the fine professors who had great enthusiasm for this subject matter.  Thank you!",0,0,Jean Cunningham,122655727
