This super fast talking guy seems to enjoy hearing himself talk. Maybe I am simple minded, but this course made me proud of that. His passion gets in the way of his ability to actually teach. The only thing I learned is that if you have to retake his exams, the actual answers change meanings.Also, according to his lessons, I am green colorblind.  That is ridiculous. Emerald is my favorite gemstone. Also, just because a woman is attractive according to him, doesn't mean that she is the only type of woman worthy of a husband. I think he talks before he thinks.

If you're considering to take this up, make sure you're not on a tight schedule to completing it.Course content is pretty interesting as the Prof does a great job in explaining the concepts clearly and using real-life case studies for you to see why the concepts are the way they are. However,Quizzes are extremely difficult to pass. Questions are mostly application types or scenario-based so you need to have a very strong grasp and deep understanding of the lecture material. There were barely any ""straightforward"" questions. If you fail the quiz, you have to wait 8h to access it again and that really slows down your course progress significantly. The next time you re-do the quiz, you may be getting a different set of questions as well. Most of the time, I have to take 2 - 3 tries to pass the quizzes. There's a lot of Math involved in the course so FYI for those who don't like to deal with equations. 60-70% of the  content is geared towards genetics topics.",0,0,Geraldine Ng ,60985932

For example we haven't constructed a phylogeny tree using a computer program, maybe the course should try and approach online students with more Online practical tools. (I consider it abit outdated 3.5/5)The course explanation : Prof. Noor is a wonderful instructor, he constructed the course beautifully and explained it the same, the existence of interactive slides and varied topics is wonderful (5/5)The quiz and support : That's the terrible part of the course, the course is Dead, no instructor support or rarely you see any, I have asked multiple questions across various weeks and expected atleast an answer after a week, nothing so far. Instructor support is more than necessary to make the course outcome 100%, however I consider my outcomes about 70%. The quizes are sometimes phrased in unnecessarily difficult to comprehend structure, maybe revisit that. (1/5)The external material : They are mostly over comprehensive and not focused just on what we have learnt instead they are a broader line up and deeper focus on the topic itself, meeting stuff we haven't actually learned and having no one to go back to and discuss it with makes the external sources utterly useless. (0/5)Course access : Coursera has provided incredibly easy interface, wonderful customer support and financial aid to developing students like me, Having myself learnt 70% at a course from Duke university is INCREDIBLE, all thanks to the efforts of the professor and coursera team.

Due to the pandemic, I was able to attend the 2020 North American Ornithological Conference virtually (first time I've attended). Many of the presentations contained phylogenetic trees that illustrated speciation in bird populations (often separated geographically). I really couldn't interpret the trees as I had no background in avian genomics (never took biology or genetics courses the entire time I was in school, although I did take a biochem course in grad school). It appears that avian genomics plays a huge part in on-going bird studies. One of the attendees at the conference suggested Dr. Noor's course as a place to start, which turned out to be a most excellent suggestion. Dr. Noor's enthusiasm and clear presentation of the subject matter made learning the material relatively easy, even for someone of my years.

Prof Noor has taught me a lot about Genetics. He is an engaging and inspiring lecturer. It is also obvious to me that he takes a keen interest in the students, as he has been quick to reply to questions that I have asked in the forums. I'm looking forward to the Evolution lectures.I am not sure why I enrolled for this course, since I was sure I already knew the material, but I am glad that I did. I recommend the course if you belong to any of the following categories: people who think they know the subject; people who don't think know it, but are interested; everybody else (because I think you will find Prof Noor inspiring.",0,4,Simon Crase,8023553
