2405420~COURSE!~02kFB79AEeyUxgoSRgtsGw,1662251994625,3,0,"I've only gone as far as week 3, so I expect my thoughts of the course to change as I go deeper into it. So far so good. Just a few thoughts:

(1) The course could be clearer about the prerequisites required. It‚Äôs not clear to me if the student is supposed to know Swift or not. Week 3 has a video titled ‚ÄòSwift Simple Terms‚Äô where the instructor explains basic keywords like `var` and `String`. In the video that follows - ‚ÄòCreate the player‚Äô - the instructor glosses over an implementation detail that uses the `override` keyword. No explanation is given on what `override` actually is, only a vague mention that it is required to implement the feature. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. What is the overall assumption/aim here? Are we being introduced to Swift or are we expected to know Swift already? Giving attention to basic concepts one moment and doing the complete opposite the next is confusing. I think the course would be better if the instructor was consistent.

(2) The course could be clearer about the type of student engagement that‚Äôs expected in specific chapters. For instance, take the ‚ÄòWeek 3 - Project Setup‚Äô module. We‚Äôre supposed to be building a video player here. If this course is suitable for ‚Äòindividuals with no prior experience‚Äô then a great deal of the concepts mentioned here will be foreign. Most students will simply copy and paste whatever the instructor is typing in her IDE. This is alright, I think there‚Äôs a place for that kind of learning - where you simply watch and listen to appreciate the power of a tool without being expected to understand the details. It would just be a lot less confusing if the instructor mentioned that this was the expectation, and students shouldn‚Äôt bother too much about some of the complexities of the video player implementation that are being glossed over. Neither should they be worried about coding along. 

On the other hand, if the instructor does expect the student to code along and grasp what‚Äôs being discussed then I don‚Äôt think a video player project is the most suitable project at this point in the journey. Developing a less complex feature/project may better serve the student.",0,1,Yamikani Chinamale,2405420

Had this been my actual introduction to iOS Development I may have been overwhelmed, confused, and discouraged by this course. It focuses on telling rather than teaching, and gives you a lot of unnecessary information that could be saved for later when you are more comfortable with iOS development.
