56012311~COURSE!~tFwCDZI2EeutdhLeSmY08w,1664131795899,5,0,"Excellent course!If we recall the early days of human navigation on sea, many diseases were discovered, technologies invented, and thus, with the sacrifice of thousands of seafarers, has come the reward of safety.
Similarly for air travels.
We are yet toddlers trying to get a glimpse outside our known terrestrial knowledge and experience.
So with greater challenges, innumerable (and I mean it) human sacrifices, will be get to reach the desired safety of space travel.
At 50 years, with Diabetes, early kidney disease, IHD, and a h/o CVA, myself, an Obstetrician in a remote rural town in India, will probably never see that day.
Yet I do see that day! .....
when intelligent robots will manage a self-sustained human settlement in many different parts of our Solar System.
Everyday as I witness new lives being brought into this world, I just wonder what's in store for their future .... poverty, diseases, crime for the most unfortunates; or a better life with adequate nutrition, hygiene, education, job-satisfaction, and a society of healthy minds.
But I am optimistic.
One day, even the least developed countries will reach that state of physical, mental, and social health, which we all desire.
I not just hope; I do know.
So my regards to all involved in space explorations, around the world, for advancing human civilization.
And thanks so much for this wonderful discourse .... feeling fortunate to know to many things from you guys.
Thanks all again.",0,1,Anandamay Mukhopadhyay,56012311
