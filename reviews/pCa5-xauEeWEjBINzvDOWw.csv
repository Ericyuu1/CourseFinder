502389~COURSE!~pCa5-xauEeWEjBINzvDOWw,1591648978034,1,0,"This is painful to watch. Sadly, uttering a series of correct statements is not the same as teaching a subject. The lecturer clearly knows his materials, but ends up making the course content harder than it really is. Automaton theory is a wonderful topic to be working with but this lecture is more confusing than helpful. I'd recommend to buy a good book on the matter, its less frustrating and probably explains things better.",0,0,Hanno Hildmann,502389

1274238~COURSE!~pCa5-xauEeWEjBINzvDOWw,1504848915352,2,0,"This course is incredibly information dense in lectures, and very light on examples and why and how to apply what you've learned:First: there are no problem sets and very few examples, making it hard to explore the topics discussed in the lecture. I'm not the best listener, so maybe everything is clear and I'm missing it, but doing is the way I learn best. Also, I can find almost no reference to this topic anywhere else which is a little unusualSecond: the lectures don't motivate the topic in any practical way. Even the 'alternating bit' protocol lecture was just discussing the solution to the problem itself. Having watched all the lectures I still don't know what I would use any of this topic for. Also couldn't get the 'alternating bit protocol' software to work, just crashed on my osx laptop.I would love to do a class on system validation, Coq, TLA+, etc. are all interesting topics to me, I just want a class that helps me do those things.",0,1,Aaron Brady,1274238
39711719~COURSE!~pCa5-xauEeWEjBINzvDOWw,1600866028507,3,0,There are little examples in the course or the book and that makes it difficult to practice for the quizzes or really get a feel for the information. Most times I felt I learned more reading the book after doing a quiz attempt and using the feedback than I did in the videos. I recommend adding more examples and practice exercises for this material.,0,0,Garry McManus,39711719

32078058~COURSE!~pCa5-xauEeWEjBINzvDOWw,1541189945104,3,0,Very little explanations on quite complex matter (especially on branching bisimulation). References to the book are helpful except that sometimes it has different definitions. For example the books definition of the language is the set of non-extendable traces while the lector treats it as the set of terminated traces. The description of alternating bit protocol is absolutely beyond my understanding. Though its rather simple and well described in wikipedia.,0,2,Oleg Volkov,32078058

It's my first course on Coursera, so I can't compare. But I think sometimes it lacks a bit clarity, especially considering lecturer's English and bad quality of subtitles which sometimes do not match real lecturer's words. Anyway it was interesting and now I'm really intrigued about how I can apply this new knowledge to real everyday development tasks. Most probably I will try following courses in the specialization.

3624114~COURSE!~pCa5-xauEeWEjBINzvDOWw,1597087183229,4,0,"This is a very basic course in automata theory and covers it at a very high level.  However, it is the first course in a four course series, so this is understandable.  One feature of the course that I very much appreciated was that, on both on-line exercises and quizzes, if a wrong answer was chosen, the reason it was an error was explained.  This corrective feedback very much helped in overall understanding.I have only two complaints, both of which are minor.  First of all, one lesson uses a tool that is available on-line to demonstrate a particular graph reduction (the ""alternating bit protocol"" example).  Presently, what is available on-line is a bit out of sync with what is described in the lesson.  Second is the general ""feel"" of most of the problems.  The problems are based on graphs, and the solutions are more from observation of the graph rather than analysis.  Again, this may be more due to the fact that this course is used to provide background for succeeding courses than anything else.Overall, I am satisfied with the course.  But in order to do any sort of system validation will require taking the next three courses in the sequence.",0,0,Pat Bradford,3624114
