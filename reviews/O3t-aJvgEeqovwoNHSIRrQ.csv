Exercises were also not really helping to learn more.Positive: I saw concepts and examples that I can now read about and try out.

23045495~COURSE!~O3t-aJvgEeqovwoNHSIRrQ,1608649704768,1,0,"For course so full of information and new terms and definitions, there were too many errors when the instructor was typing and talking through the lesson. I realize that it is difficult to teach and record w/o error, but this is not something that can't be rife with syntax errors. Fixing any errors made during the lecture by just having a pop-up in the corner of the window doesn't work when we are trying to focus on  typing along and we don't know any better if we've made a mistake. And, by then we have already made that erroneous imprint on our learning. I feel as though a lot of the concept was also rushed through. I would have liked to see more explanation of the newly introduced terms.",0,3,Lia Fields,23045495
79810635~COURSE!~O3t-aJvgEeqovwoNHSIRrQ,1612996280789,3,0,"This is 'advanced' in that you're new to SQL and took beginner and intermediate.  It seems more a syntax class than learning concepts.  Recursive section needs more time.  Suggestion would be to cut and paste correct code to the demonstration to avoid re-typing and going back to correct.  Listening to a lecture, reading code and a pop-up note in the corner to add in or correct was a challenge in recursive section.  Worth the price for concepts if you're new to sql.

I have learnt a lot. 4 stars because the last part was not well explained (did not understand a word of the last section about recurrent table expressions) and the accent of the teacher was difficult to understand sometimes.
