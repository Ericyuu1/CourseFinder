Yes, there's a bunch of information but what helped me the most was to watch the video, went to YouTube and watched other people teach the class and then researched the topics and take notes.  Sure the badges are cool but this isn't a tech based course it's more book based but i will say that if you are planning on taking the Comptia Network or sec+ this course will touch up on the fundamentals.

The transcripts is not quite correct (perhaps due to the unclear sound recording) , which cannot deliver the content of the topic as clearly.2. ""Key Take Away"" - this is very important for all topics as it summarises the key points of the topic.  I really like the ""key take aways"" mentioned in the Deep Dive.

When they understand that, they would explain the key concepts more efficiently. For example, when discussing DHCP, the instructors assume the audience is just refreshing knowledge but that is not the case. The discussions on SQL Injections were also directed at audiences who were wondering on professional wisdom on cyber security practices. But this issue is present in almost all cyber related topics across companies. Please assume the students have no idea about cyber or security or cyber security. Most people hardly even know the difference between Windows and Microsoft Office. ",0,2,Theodore White-Meridian,10868151
