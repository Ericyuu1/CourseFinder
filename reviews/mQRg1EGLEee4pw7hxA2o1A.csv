You do not have to apply directly the knowledge you learned throughout the ourse, but instead try thousands of combinations of the pair (dz, gamma) to obtain a really precise value for the rms error. I have spent many hous (would say more than 10) trying to achieve so, and I think I'm not the only one, considering the discussion forums. Frankly, I was really disappointed. Appart from that, the course was great, but I hope that the fact mentioned above does not discourage many people.",0,0,Fernando Soria Álvarez,45795239
