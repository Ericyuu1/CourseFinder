The difficulty for most of the course is low but it ramps up drastically at the end of week 4 where I had to refer to the implementation given by the instructor as my SQL skills were not good enough. You can finish this first course without having access to the complete MIMIC-III database, and you can use the demo for all the exercises, however, it took me a weekend to complete the training and process for requesting access so if you are new to clinical databases consider an extra week of work for the MIMIC-III process. It is a very academic field so there is a lot to read and study but it is accessible enough for a layman engineer like me. ",0,0,Alberto Valdez Quinto,68666562
