7083598~COURSE!~7wfVmobsEeWgjA5cAvYgmw,1483804116523,1,0,Very disappointing course. Far too much repetition. A lot of opinion based on scant evidence. It would have been much better as a 30 minute video without all the fluff and unsubstantiated inferences. I would not recommend this course.,0,0,Robert Klanfer,7083598

15851652~COURSE!~7wfVmobsEeWgjA5cAvYgmw,1456077894833,2,0,"The last assignment is a time-waster and really poorly designed. Not all
 adults are into coloring; this is not elementary school and what's the 
point of coloring a picture of the Arch for you? Frankly I can't be bothered to look up 
sources for the descriptions of Roman soldiers' attire, and especially 
to figure what each number is pointing to. It wasn't even always clear what the numbers on the template referred to and two of the numbers were missing. In addition, there were a lot of glitches with the grading software. Finally our questions were almost never answered. Otherwise I found this
 to be an interesting course and I learned quite a bit from it, although
 it could have been condensed into three or four classes at the very most. The video lectures were videotaped a bit strangely, with Professor Fine often seeming to talk to an invisible person on the right or the left of the camera, instead of at the viewer. The videos I liked were mostly the office hours ones and the one with the interview with Rabbi Elliot Cosgrove at Park Avenue Synagogue. I could have gotten a very good grade on this course, but the last assignment ruined that. No, I will not be recommending this course or any others by this Professor.",0,0,YURI DE LA PENA,15851652

18401039~COURSE!~7wfVmobsEeWgjA5cAvYgmw,1461340614236,3,0,Historically the basic background  have been discussed.  Effort was to make it nationalistic and emotional. Significance of Menorah as a symbol is absolutely missing. All the emphasis was on the Arch but the Arch looses its very significance without the menorah. So this should be covered or shared properly. For example  Questions like why 7 hands needs to be replied.  Why 3 legs needs to be replied Why painting ?  This learning was not supposed to be in it.  Someone might or might not like painting as a concept to learn and the course title also gave no indication towards that.. Wrong to make it a mandatory part as an assignment. ,0,0,Rahul Ray,18401039

Professor Steven Fines has a great teaching ability about him, I really enjoyed listening and watching his enthusiasm on the topic.The reason I only gave 4 star instead of 5 is quite an insignificant reason really but it is because any close up camera action was not the best quality.

It both further my reading and knowledge in some areas, while introducing new topics to me that I'd not yet encountered.   My only problem was with the final assignment - it does not do justice to the topic of the final week, which is the issue of colour on ancient monuments (in particular the arch, of course) and the implications of colour on composition and on later perceptions of antiquity.  The assignment itself did not give me an opportunity to really explore these issues.  ",0,0,Alison U'Ren,6347567
