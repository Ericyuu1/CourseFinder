The reason I'm giving it a low score is because it's evident that this course has been abandoned by the staff (and they never payed much attention to it to begin with). First, the videos are blurry from the overlay of slides and recording, they also contain mistakes that are fixed while the instructor goes through them. They are videos and it looks like it's been 5-6 years since they were recorded, definitely time enough to fix those things. But my main problem are the assignments: They use really old versions of java, scala and spark, which leaves students trying to find workarounds to install and use these old versions. Sometime the code doesn't match what the assignment is showing. The answers in the forums are sporadic and, usually, not that helpful to begin with. All of this wouldn't bother me too much in a free course, but not only this is not a free course, it's also part of the specialization so, regardless of all the issues mentioned, students have to do it and pay for the certificate if they want to get the full specialization.",0,4,Miguel Alonso,4816

Therefore lots of googling, looking the forum, trial and error: it took a lot of time for a painful experience I've learnt nearly nothing from. And the considerable complexity of setting up the local infrastructure only grants a limited and basic spark configuration (with no real scale out beyond the number of cpu's), therefore it's no beneficial in any way.It would be much more instructive if the exercise could be worked out on an existing could Spark installation, where one could also have a sense of how the Spark capabilities can scale out.Lastly, the splitting of material by weeks: for weeks 1,2 and 4 the exercises appeared as being assigned twice.

I learned a lot.  I'm glad I good the course, and I'm speechless that I finally finished it with a passing albeit imperfect score. This was the maiden voyage and it has some problems that should probably be corrected.  That's my opinion.    There were generally two sets of challenges with each assignment exercise (1) undemanding the scala/big-data component, and (2) understand what's being asked.  Sometimes the comment in the code are wrong or misleading.  In particular in the 2nd set of exercises.  The functions are very poorly specified, and there are no unit tests.  there should be one or the other.  Without a specification the user cannot write his own tests.  In addition the 2nd exercise is intended to be do-able, but not efficiently until the user views week 3's videos.  Because of this the text output is EXTREMELY verbose, making it impossible to read the error messages and understand them.  When the user finally submits the assignment it fails and the grader gives misleading error messages.  A failing unit test should at the very least explain what the test was, what the measured value was, and what was expected.  This is especially true when the user is forbidden from looking at the actual testing code.  An additional problem with exercise 2, is that the student is asked to calculate a particular percentage, but it is not explained what this is a percentage OF and there are several ways to interpret it.  I didn't realize until wasting 2 weeks that there was an alternate interpretation which I could try.In the 3rd exercise some of the comments in the code are wrong/misleading.  Particularly with regard to  classifiedColumns.    comment #3 should read:* 3. other activities (leisure). These are the columns starting with “t02”, “t04”, “t06”, “t07”, “t08”, “t09”, “t10”, “t12”, “t13”, “t14”, “t15”, “t16” and “t18”  BUT EXCLUDING those which are not part of the previous groups only.  Otherwise the sentence is at best grammatically incorrect, and at worst misleading.Another significant issue with this ""Bit Data"" course is that it assumes a user understands data base and can construct sql queries.  Well, such background is not a prerequisite, but the student needs such information to successfully finish the exercises. I can understand the temptation by the course developers to include a section on SQLspark, as this is a very powerful set of spark libraries, but I believe it is beyond the prerequisites.  I could not have finished the course if I hadn't had an SQL/data-base expert in the same office, who I could pose questions to.I hope you find my comments useful.",0,0,Jim Newton,18981411

Should be amplified with additional weeks of topics, e.g. on Spark Streaming, etc. The Grader often returns opaque errors (""The Grader Failed""), when the actual problem was that the program ran out of memory or out of disk space.  Grader can reject solutions, e.g. on the last assignment, if the programmer uses a different rounder implementation that returns subtly-different results, though the results print out as the same to the rounded degree of precision.

In addition to this, I could listen to Heather all day long - she's a great presenter and has wonderful teaching skills. However, the homework has outlined some neglected aspects of the course:- vague description or requirements- not strongly related to the presented content (the lectures outlined partitioning mechanism, but the homework 2 did not require it...)- not so meaningful feedback, except for some tests failing/passing - I would have expected something like you did ok, but your job took longer than expected; check out this and thatOverall, it's been a highly expected course and it was nice to get a broader outlook on Spark.

Points for improvement: I wish this course was 2-3 courses focusing on topic with more assignments. If a concept is reviewed by the student is not challenged with tough questions the concept is not learned. People taking this course are already advanced enough to tackle difficult challenges, sometimes it appears that instructor assumes that students are entry level.    A note for online instructors: avoid jokes. They do not work online.  I think a specialization on applications of spark with scala covering AI, graph and text processing would be interesting.

I would recommend only the following tweaks:Week 1 assignment: Either tightly specify the function that determines if a particular String is present in a large textstring OR provide the function in the assignment skeleton. There are too many ways to approach this function that are correct, but different than the one the grader used. This function is only incidental to the goal of applying one's knowledge of Spark to the assignment.Week 4: Allocate additional lectures to flesh out the coverage of Datasets.

16229664~COURSE!~e8VseYIYEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,1490295378839,5,0,"I learned so much from this course! It was amazing how Dr. Miller used concepts that were meticulously built up in the earlier courses, such as evaluation strategy, functional collections, reactive programming, and associativity, to describe the core of Spark in only four units. As someone coming from more of a statistics background, I started this specialization only to learn Spark, so I wasn't always sure how relevant learning the more theoretical underpinnings of Scala would be. It turns out that it was pretty essential, while also just making me a better programmer. Looking forward to the capstone!",0,0,Shae Selix,16229664
