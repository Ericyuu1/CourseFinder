14476772~COURSE!~qJJrTU5lEeaRUwokXvhjDw,1655885532805,1,0," After completing this specialization I recognized this program covers very little business. I thought if I continued then I 'd see this program 's value, that didn't happen. I hope this curriculum gets revised to include actual business instruction and not communication theories and quantitative stats. If you're interested in learning international business University of Colorado \Coursera and New Mexico University \Coursera are suitable alternatives. Throughout this specialization it seems the instructors are reading from a teleprompter while offering no practical examples. It also seems this specialization was created from unused blooper footage. University of London offers great classes ""Managing the Company of the Future, "" Corporate Strategy "" and ""Manager 's Toolkit"" ). So it's surprising they would put out this garbage. I encourage everyone to avoid my mistake by dropping this worthless and time consuming pursuit.",0,1,Dustin hollinger,14476772

But: not very dynamic videos, no explanation of Business Model Canvas whereas now very used by startups, not very useful exams: just parts of business plan reviewed by our peers.

Don't underestimate the time it takes to complete the project to a satisfactory level, the courses leading up to this took a lot of time and this is no different. Writing a complete business plan and also reviewing others are new skills that I believe will serve my career well. A great primer for an MBA and it really gave me confidence in the University of London as an institution.",0,1,Mason Ellery Husky,17242353
