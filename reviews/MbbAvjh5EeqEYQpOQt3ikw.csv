I intend to go back to the material in the future should I encounter real-life scenarios on this topic. The Week 1 part of this course is exactly the same as the entire content of the course titled ""Physician/Student Opioid Use Disorder Medication Assisted Treatment Waiver Training"" of the same institution. I am only giving four stars out of five because I believe that the delivery of the topic can be made unforgettable and more MOOC-like than a webinar recording.",0,0,Aedrian Abrilla,41195652
