38325160~COURSE!~xTQk7rhyEeayqhK4SOTn7g,1675436301966,3,0," Well, the course did a good job of summarizing and presenting major interesting topics about Modern China. However, it is still a little behind. China nowadays, especially in this post-covid era, had changed dramatically both in political and economical terms. For example, the decentralization of the local government is no longer the case as President Xi tighten his central control, and the Chinese economy had no longer experienced a high growth rate as the course suggested. In fact, in 2022, the growth rate was about 3.3%, far less than 7-8%， which was the data presented in the course. I would say this course, though presented major topics of China, is no longer up-to-date and needed to be revised accordingly. The course reading needs to be renewed or changed to some later-published paper in order to provide a better and fresher overview of the Chinese social situation.  ",0,0,Zhiqiu Huang,38325160

The lectures are well produced and engaging. They are supported with careful citations and supplemented by reading assignments that anyone can access, meaning you don't need subscriptions to any journals in order to get the articles. The lectures are also supported with excellent visualizations created by the professor himself using great data sources like databases from the World Bank and surveys that he himself had a hand in designing and conducting.To get the most out of this course I agree that some background in economic theory is necessary, but it's definitely possible to pass it with a good grade even if you've never taken an Economics class before. I also think some previous knowledge and interest in modern China and its history is necessary for a deeper appreciation too.
