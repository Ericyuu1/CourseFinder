I really wanted to do this course but it's so bad. I hope he redoes this course becuase it is terrible.

29453495~COURSE!~SQKpPNBFEeWLmRLZcSb_zw,1522894804094,1,0,"I am equally disappointed in Coursera and the instructor. Test 18 provided a dead link for how we were supposed to solve the problem and there was no instruction on how to complete otherwise. I reached out to Coursera on multiple occasions asking for support and was basically ignored not counting a couple of useless responses. I will never take a Coursera course again after the embarrassing level of customer service and given the fact the course clearly had not been updated in so long that the content was so far out of date that we are receiving dead links to content. I was supposed to complete this course months ago and am just finishing now because the only way to finish this test was to blindly guess at numbers and loosely make some of those guesses based off of the feedback from other students who were struggling with this on the discussion board as well. It's a shame I leave with this impression because the course has potential and I did learn a fair amount from it, but I will not get past how poorly I was treated by Coursera's customer service and how little they cared that the course was setting students up for failure. I took this course because I do not have a strong analytics skill set and it was described as being for beginners. This content missing makes that a completely misleading description as we were not provided the knowledge or content necessary to successfully complete this course in the appropriate amount of time.

However, some of the materials in the lecture videos, including website links, have become outdated, making the course unnecessarily difficult at times. It should also be noted that basic knowledge of sports statistics and Excel functions would be beneficial prior to starting this course (the only assistance available is from other students, not the professor, in the discussion forums).",0,0,Jessica C,52271273

573870~COURSE!~SQKpPNBFEeWLmRLZcSb_zw,1592213606468,4,0,"The content of course is great for sports fans. But there are few improvements and adjustments should be made. First of all, the forum is like a ghost town. Professor did not answer students' questions. Second, some quizzes are too difficult to be solved without tips about format or background knowledge of specific sports. Last, the lecture videos are all voice over with Excel, which is hard to comprehend the topic in short period of time. Btw, the videos are somehow outdated too.If you speak Chinese, here's my review on this course. https://medium.com/@adamp3/math-behind-moneyball-%E4%BF%AE%E8%AA%B2%E5%BF%83%E5%BE%97-567bc8315d92",0,0,Adam Wang,573870
43725286~COURSE!~SQKpPNBFEeWLmRLZcSb_zw,1587379895686,4,0,The content was extensive and well explained. It was also nice that we were dealing with real life data that kept the course practical and every operation was carried out over Excel. This thus helps enhance both your Excel knowledge as well as your ability to use data analytics to improve and predict sports outcomes. Professor Winston also provides the students with multiple anecdotes in connection to sporting scenarios that often help comprehension and lightens the mood.The negatives however are with regard to the scoring of tests. If you get the test answer right you get 100 and 0 if you get it wrong with the criteria being 1% to pass. I would suggest giving marks for reaching certain steps building up to the answers so that people don't end up not completing the course simply because they couldn't clear a test. I would also recommend a sort of method to get in touch with the instructor/author of the course in the event of not being able to understand a concept sufficiently well.,0,0,arnav rathna,43725286

Having a background in statistics and sports is huge, I can see how the class could be challenging for those who do not. There is a 10 week + final exam calendar but that's more of a guideline as I finished in 6 weeks. Readings are not necessary at all.

I do wish this course was called ""Introduction to Sports Analytics"", or ""Sports Analytics I""  so it would be easier to find. It seems like this course should have many more reviews than it does.
