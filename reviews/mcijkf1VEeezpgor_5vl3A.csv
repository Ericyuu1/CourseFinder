But one thing I want to say about this course is that some web links given in this course are not accessible to me. There might be a problem with my browser or internet connection, I tried several times opening Athena but I could not open the site.  Please fix this problem if this is the weblink issue, overall this course was great. Suggestion to improve the learning from this course is this course must contain a section on how to make a hypothesis regarding insilico study of genes. ",0,0,Muhammad Numan,10965571
