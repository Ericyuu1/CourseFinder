I thoroughly enjoyed the two peer-graded assignments and certainly improved my self-reflective skills. It was a little difficult to concentrate and learn much from the videos, I think a more interactive style would suit certain learners better. Also, because of the wording of one of the questions on the peer-graded assignments, I got a lower score than I thought I should have done. When I wanted to speak to someone about this, it was almost impossible to find any way to contact them, which was frustrating. ",0,0,Hannah Quinn,70189833

Verify its validity and reliability by appropriate statistical methods. The study sample consisted of (64) male and female teachers of social and national education curricula for the upper basic stage in Tafila Governorate in Jordan. The study concluded that the study sample members’ estimates of the degree of availability of social and national concepts and values ​​contained in the paragraphs of the tool as a whole came to a medium degree, and that most of the paragraphs of the tool received medium and high estimates except for paragraph No. (13) which received a low rating, as the results indicated.

I missed contributions from other countries, for example from Poland. This was a little bit disappointing. Our social pedagogy in Poland is a well established academic discipline with much to offer to this discussion. My own department at Maria  Grzegorzewska University - The Social Pedagogy Department-  is a hub of Helena Radlinska's pedagogy and the UNESCO Janusz Korczak Chair I personally Chair is a hub of Janusz Korczak pedagogical heritage. I think that also the patron of our University: Maria Grzegorzewska is a figure of interest for social pedagogues. I would cherish an opportunity to enrich your course content through contribution from Poland,thank you for having me at this course, Best regards, Anna",0,3,Anna Odrowaz-Coates,39657931
