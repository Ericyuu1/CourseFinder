1427998~COURSE!~cdQYUI44Eeu3ohKUPTd6hQ,1647556137066,4,0,The lecturer speaks very precise and gives the impression of very knowledgeable person on this topic. I wish there were more video where he talks about AI. It's a good course if you understand that lecturer gives short insights that you have to explore on your own. It's great as a supplementary course for designers who are interested in AI but not as standalone learning material. I give it four stars because the author incorporates the basics of research but it's too vague and doesn't feel fitted into course main topic. I think the course didn't reach its full potential but there are two more courses in whole specialization.,0,0,Ernest Warzocha,1427998
