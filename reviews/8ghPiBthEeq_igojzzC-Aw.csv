74892938~COURSE!~8ghPiBthEeq_igojzzC-Aw,1603886595259,2,0,There are alot of bugs in the code. I spent more hours debugging the codes (which I still have not found the errors). While I appreciate the skilling up on debugging - it just ate up too much time and killed the momentum. ,0,1,marvin marchadesch,74892938
57833725~COURSE!~8ghPiBthEeq_igojzzC-Aw,1592540648459,3,0,"This is marked as a Beginner project, but there is a prerequisite that is not mentioned anywhere. The prerequisite project is marked as an Intermediate level project, so it doesn't quite make sense. It needs to be clear that the other project is a prerequisite for this one.  I took this to get an introduction to Plotly and Python - alot of time was spent on how to clean and group data through Python, which I guess was helpful, but more description around the correct syntax for functions would have been helpful.",0,2,Pearl Shen,57833725

37192217~COURSE!~8ghPiBthEeq_igojzzC-Aw,1594567457028,4,0,The course gives us a look into feature engineering. The code explanation was OK. But it actually puts emphasis on the learners to be familiar with pandas and matplotlib libraries basics. So might be a little scarier for absolute beginners.  ,0,0,Anantharaman K,37192217

I was totally taking this course to check whether I am liking this particular domain. Trust me after completing both the projects i.e. Seaborn and Plotly I can at least tell myself that I love data visualization. Yes, the syntax is confusing for first timers but you won't enjoy courses where they teach you theory so I purposely took these two courses. Thanks a lot for sharing your knowledge",0,0,Yashodhan Mehta,62287391
