So you are dragging and dropping without knowing the reason why. My ""Game"" didn't work correctly but I didn't understand how to look for problems to debug as the error was somewhere in the first level. But I didn't even know how to go back and look at the first level instructions.We built a game at two levels but I wish we had been running it at each level to see if we needed to debug at each level. My program didn't move to the second backdrop.

39804256~COURSE!~UBsO5bgmEeqSfRIG7Ssz0Q,1607395366349,3,0,"To begin, this course should place the learner on notice of any minimal computer resource requirements prior to taking the course such as computer hardware system requirements, software requirements and browser requirements.  All should be clearly stated prior to undertaking a guided project to ensure that the learner is able to benefit from all aspects of the guided project and to be able to make use of all of the commensurate functionality associated with the Rhyme computer environment.  For example being aware of any media software requirements that needed to be installed on one's computer prior to taking the guided project; being aware of any current hardware graphics accelerator that is needed; being aware of any current web browser needed, or any browser update required, or any specific web browser type; being made aware that all driver updates for hardware and software should be implemented prior to undertaking the guided project, plus making any computer system and browser system configurations prior to taking the guided project.  In short, after many hours of searching and investigation, I determined that my computer was (and is) too old for utilization in a Rhyme environment.  Although understandable, learners should also be advised that they will have limited time to make use of the guided project space and limited time in the Rhyme environment prior to taking the course because the impression is that the course takes two hours to learn, but learners are not advised of any restriction to access.  The overall layout of the guided project is good, however the instructor seemed either confused or unsure of what steps she was presenting to learners at times.  On the upside, she was easy to follow, easy to understand and a pleasant communicator who is knowledgeable of the subject matter.  Moreover, she and the course content ensured a neophyte sufficient understanding of the subject matter such that a beginner could pass the course-quiz plus be able to make use of the Scratch editor.  Please understand that my criticism is meant to be constructive criticism and not meant as negative criticism for criticisms sake; and please know that I genuinely appreciate the Coursera platform and courses offered.  Moreover I appreciate the instructors who have a love of knowledge and who equally love sharing that knowledge with others for a reasonable and modest fee.  In conclusion, please be assured that I am grateful to the universities, businesses, organizations, content experts, and to Coursera for providing me with the opportunity to learn in such a diverse environment.  I am enriched by the Coursera experience, and eventually I will be able to give back to humanity and society because of the Coursera experience.",0,4,Rufus F Rhea jr,39804256
