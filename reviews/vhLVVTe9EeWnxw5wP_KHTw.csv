38481533~COURSE!~vhLVVTe9EeWnxw5wP_KHTw,1608757611889,2,0,"Hi, I
am writing this review in Dec. 2020. The first two weeks of training are
almost great. The one thing I would add as an instructor to make these
first 2 weeks great is a couple of training exercises before
assigning the ""bigger"" assignment at the end of week 2. The
reason for this is that the content covered in these 2 weeks is quite
large. Therefore I felt as a learner that when I had to do what they
called ""assignment 2"" (at the end of week 2), I had to go over the
whole pedagogical content of the 2 weeks (and I am talking about 60 pages of
instructions that I used to transcribe instructions and examples covered
in the lessons). So a few small coding exercises would definitely help learners
like me with no experience in html and css (which is what this course is made
for, so they say) to retain what was covered, instead of trying to memorize the
whole content covered in the first 2 weeks. Then
from week 3 onward came the difficulties. This course was created in 2014 if I
am not wrong, using the framework Bootstrap 3. This framework like any other
software out there has evolved quite a bit since. So I would give the first 2 weeks a 4.5 if possible.So I
would have appreciated in the course description some information about that aspect,
and the fact that from week 3 onward not much of what the instructor shows in
his code is valid anymore. I understand that evolution and upgrades is very much
part of the field of computer science. So is the ability to problem solve, go
online and look for solutions on how to solve certain issues and reach out to
the community for ideas. However, when the way for me to go forward is just to
look in the forum for answers to my problems and copy paste bits of code from
getbootstrap.com that will (or not) work, I do not feel that I am learning much
as I do not understand some bits of code I am using. The instructor does go
over much of the code he uses in his lectures, but again, his comments often do
not apply to the bits of code I end up using because, again, his course was
created several years ago. So I feel frustrated that I have to spend xx hours
per video of in most cases less than 10 minutes, trying to figure out what
works and what does not and how to make it work. Because of all this, I give the whole course a 2. An upgraded version of this course is urgently needed, Denis",0,4,Denis Charlot,38481533

I took other HTML/CSS courses before and struggled with some specific concepts that this course was able to explain in a way I could understand. However, the Javascript section was very poorly taught. I can say that I have no idea about Javascript even after barely passing Weeks 4 and 5. I think the way it was presented didn't really teach you how to do things or help you understand concepts, but rather, ""This is what we need to do for this specific project, just memorize what I'm doing without any explanations for why I am doing what I am doing,"" in addition to the fact that you only get one coding activity per week - the final assignments. I think that the course really needs to have a system where students regularly are practicing their code they are learning, not just learn ~20 lessons and have a big assignment at the end. Maybe some students can learn through rote memorization, but I feel many students, including myself, would struggle because we aren't being taught the actual concepts. I would honestly say that maybe after some self-study on HTML/CSS and even JS would be a better foundation, and then maybe take this course once you know the fundamentals, because if you are anything like me, you'll just need to go back to self-study for JS to understand the basics after taking this course.

The speaker was overly wordy in their attempt to explain simple content like 'Arrays' 'Closures' 'Objects' as a few examples.  The presenter should follow a more linear approach to explaining and to their visual examples. Often the presenter would bounce back and forth in a futile attempt to sound more astute.  Sometimes less is more.  The same could be seen in their way of presenting certain examples with jumping back and forth between examples in efforts to clarify any and all possabilities of how to code the topic being discussed.  One keyword was used during this course lecture and that word was 'verbose' the javascript portion felt too wordy/verbose. This  along with what seemed like poor audio quality caused a few sections to be reviewed more than once for clarity .   Course needs ES6 material as well.

1) the course is from 2016 so you might have to search google to download few things at beginings (its not imposible just be patient)
2)week 1 and 2 are perfect, but when it comes to bootstrap in week3, its bootstrap1. We now have bootstrap5, so many classes does not work at all unless you download boootstrap 1 files (but dont, its waste of time to learn bootstrap 1 classes and switch to 5)
3) tha javascript course is really really confusing. he assumes you already have a knowledge in programming and starts to teach it. I had a really hard time understanding what he is doing and why he is doing that.

From what I've heard, the JavaScript portion is a little out of date in some aspects as well. The course  nudges you towards Yaakov's Coursera Specialization on Angular JS. I feel it should at least briefly acknowledge that currently React is a more common JavaScript framework, and new learners may be better off directing their attention to learning it instead of Angular JS.All-in-all, still a good course.

I had no experience with CSS, so found the contents really helpful. The assignment at the end, while not difficult at all, helps to practice the contents of the week. Week 3: I like the idea of creating a website from scratch as you can see the thought processes that goes into designing a website and can also pick up few tips and tricks on the way. That would be my main takeaway from week 3. Bootstrap is also introduced. However,  the contents in this regard are outdated since the instructor uses Bootstrap 3 but as of 2019, there is Bootstrap 4. I did the assignment using Bootstrap 4 and there are definitely differences between the two versions. Nevertheless, it is not that bad, since it is possible to find the required information from the Bootstrap documents, w3schools, stackoverflow etc. Week 4 and 5: Introduction to JavaScript.

It is ideal for learners with little to no background in web development but moderate to light background in programming logic and syntax.  My only serious complaint (and reason for docking a star) is that the course lectures haven't been updated in the last 7 years and some of the technologies presented have evolved.  Other nitpicks are that the projects were rather lightweight (Javascript section especially) and that the lectures could be a little overly verbose.

However, I feel as though the title and description is a bit misleading. The course starts off with a complete introduction for beginners into the history and application of HTML and CSS. However, when you start Javascript in Week 4, I was caught off guard with the first video stating ""This module assumes that you have the basic understanding of programming. If you don't know general concepts like variables ... you will have a tough time getting this module. ... I suggest you find and go through a programming basics tutorial first then come back and finish this module."" This is a complete shift from the other modules teaching basic concepts before applying it. A recommended ""programming basics tutorial"" isn't even linked for us to reference.  The description of the course, however, states ""we will get a thorough introduction to the most ubiquitous, popular, and incredibly powerful language of the web: Javascript"". Nowhere in the description, or even the first few introductory videos of the course, does it say anything about requiring a background in programming. There are recommended books, but if I'm paying for a course, I would prefer to have the education I need within the paid course, and the recommendations would be if I want to take my learning further.All in all, I am enjoying this course, but I felt this was important to point out, as it felt quite discouraging and misleading.",0,0,Cameron Deal,103324757

Overall, I would say it was a very helpful introduction to the subject, especially the HTML and CSS modules. I feel like I got a general understanding of how these two programming languages work and how to utilize them to build a simple website. The lectures were straightforward and interesting and the assigments were helpful, hands-on practice that gave a sense of accomplishment.The last two modules, which covered JavaScript, definitely got more convoluted and more difficult to follow. The Javascript assignments were fairly simple and yet didn't leave me feeling like I had much understanding of what I'd really done to complete them. I think this part of the course material could have been explained better or in more depth. My other criticism of this course, as also stated byb many other reviews, is how outdated it is. It took a lot of extra time to set up for the first assignment because a lot of things with GitHub and the various software has changed. However, I would not let this dissuade you from taking the course, I actually think doing some of my own research and figuring things out was helpful in getting things to stick in my brain. There are a lot of people with similar questions so you can usually find answers in the discussion forum or on sites like Stack Exchange, just be aware of the extra time needed to complete assignments. I hope that Johns Hopkins University will update this course soon to make it a bit more useful for current times. ",0,1,Jillian Urbach,106177597

Pros - Theory, presentation, organization. In general, the course is delivered very well, it is interesting to watch, the lectures themselves are delivered beautifully and informatively. A trip to a client is a very interesting move. Instructions for the tasks and in general all the material (main and additional) is very useful and well structured.

Cons - Partly material, tasks, difficulty level of some topics. Outdated technologies are used (which is actually logical, after all, the course is old, but during this time it has not undergone changes in accordance with the development of technologies), mostly bootstrap, but there are also many small points that are no relevant and teach bad code (iife). Tests that I would like to replace with tasks. Tasks that are too simple and few of them. There is also a problem with a jumping level of complexity and missing explanations to the code. It will be quite difficult for a beginner to master this course.

Also, the coding assignments felt way too simple for the amount of content that was presented in each module, even without having a good grasp of the concepts it's easy to get a 100 since the comments basically hold your hand through the code.In general, for someone like me who had basic knowledge of HTML and no prior experience with CSS and Javascript, I got what I expected and I feel much more confident in learning more about web development, but the course definitely shows its age, so there may be better options nowadays.",0,1,Leonardo Meléndez,57020793

If you don't know basics of HTML, CSS and especially JS (author also noticed it) you must learn it by yourself before entering this course or choose another one. If  you're super beginner it will be much confusing! Secondly, there are a lot of old information ( starting from github set up and finishing with old stuff in lectures). For example, you will study  old version of Bootstrap wich CSS classes was to much updated in latest version so it's too foolishly.However, this course gives a lot of useful information to supplement your knowledge.

I found them quite easy. I understand that the last assignment was aimed mostly at forcing students to view all the lectures or get familiar with the provided code, but doing something bigger for the assignment (or at least without such obvious hints) would be a nice challenge and bring more value to the certificate, I think. Splitting week 4 into two with separate assignments is also worth considering, as there was a lot of material covered in the last week, in my opinion (but I may be biased, as I went through the last week in a hurry, because I was late with my assignment).",0,1,Dominik Maj,693967

The course has been created so that most people can understand what's happening here (even if you're new to programming).I'm only giving this 4 stars because there are some things that make this course too slow, in my opinion. I don't think you need to mention which file we are working on [after the first couple of times] because we can easily see that by the name of the file and the browser of Sublime. Those are a few seconds that are a waste of time. Secondly, I think that the questions in the practice questionnaires are a bit too easy. I didn't feel like they prepared me enough for the project at the end of week 2. You mostly ask if something is true/not which is too easy to guess. I think you would greatly improve the quality of the course if you designed some mini-situations. For instance (not sure if Coursera allows it), show a mini mockup and give 10 lines of code. Then ask how you will add another div to the top right of the mockup so that it aligns with the current code without breaking. Making those exercises not the same as your lecture code is going to help improve self-awareness. Currently, I think that people find it way too easy to select the right answer, since it's easy to remember what you said and what not. I also understand that you wanted us to like the page for good reasons (because you look an extremely radiant and happy person) but I think you oversold it a bit. You should have mentioned that once or twice, but no more. Seeing it in a few of the examples wasn't quite my cup of tea.On a good note, I was extremely [pleasantly] surprised when you did that real world project thing. That was an amazing idea and you're executing the details quite well (not writing 100% code on-screen, etc.).  I really like how you sometimes say that we should look up the reference by ourselves, since that's what most programmers do (I study CS and after 3 years, plus a 6 month internship at a big company, this can't be more true).I'm definitely giving this a 5* if you fix the questions to be harder and a bit more different to what you said in the respective video. They should make you think. Also, some of them could be open answers, requiring you to recall classes/code by memory (or cheat by watching the video). It would be nice if the answer was in some reference, so people could learn to use that too.",0,2,Martin Petkov,10513128

Mr. Chaikin does a good job of explaining many of the intricate topics in each of the three topics (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). At times, the material feels a little rushed, but that's not the fault of the instructor. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript could take up an entire course each, and there would still be a large volume of topics you could miss. So, I believe the flow of the course is suited for the intended purpose: To teach the basics of each topic in such a way that one can build a functional website.

I have had some difficulties with the initial system setup as the software versions nowadays are on a newer release and the screenshots do not match any longer. I think it would be great to renew this video based on the actual versions.
As well it took me some time to get my new module solution available in GitHub to make it direktly accessible via link. I think with module5 I found a way :)
Week5 was too fast for me. There is so much info inside. I got my solution to work but I am not sure I fully understood what and why I am doing so.
With Ajax we basically loaded code snippets and modified them using JS. But I am wondering if I can use Ajax as well to let the webserver perform some calculations / validations and return the result back. I need to dig into this piece ...Now, after 5 weeks, what can I say more than:

52929656~COURSE!~vhLVVTe9EeWnxw5wP_KHTw,1631203616426,5,0,"A very solid course about front-end basics. Many authors avoid the deep
dive to mechanics of the technologies they teach in order to simplify the
course and attract novices, but not this one. And that’s truly exciting! Moreover,
many trainers and mentors teach you how to do something, but they do not
mention how to use this knowledge, when the course is over. How to start? What
is the yesterday’s novice supposed to do in order to start his or her own carrier?
Mr. Yaakov Chaikin gives not just a direction, but also a bunch of advices on how
to communicate with the client, what strategy should a novice build to
undertake the first steps on the path to the Junior developer position, etc.Many reviewers admit, that the course is outdated (in 2021) in terms of
environment setup and Bootstrap version. Yes, this course is about Bootstrap 3
and there is Bootstrap 5 out there. Moreover, while float-based elements had
been used in Bootstrap 3 to create an adaptive layout, the flex-based (sadly, CSS
flex is not mentioned in this course as well as CSS Grid) elements moved in
with Bootstrap 4. Similar situation is with Bootstrap 5: Jquery library is not
utilized in it. But I say, all these things are not disadvantages but
opportunities. Opportunities to learn something by yourself, to improve your
skill in navigating in the seas of information flows (joking, just surf through
MDN, Bootstrap documentation and stackoverflow) and to be ready for tomorrow’s version
of the web, because it is very dynamic.As for me, I was an adept of HTML 4 😂 But this course brought me to the actual state
of arts in the front-end world and yes, I’ve learned several things by myself
but with the motivation and foundation I’ve got in this course. Last but not
least, JavaScript part of this course ruined my underestimation of this
language, because Mr. Chaikin showed its power and core mechanics (so often omitted
on the Internet).Conclusion: solid 5 stars.P.S. I sincerely wish to see the 2022 version of this course.",0,2,Artem Izmailov,52929656

Module 1: Very simple HTML, everything you need to know before moving onto CSS.Module 2: A lot of useful knowledge, such as ""The Box Layout"", custom responsive frameworks, pseudo classes (very used, such as changing  the color of a button when you hover over it, etc.) and more things you can't go make a website without knowing.Module 3: A lot of basic Bootstrap things, though right now the latest Bootstrap version is 5v, a lot of things are from Bootstrap 3 and they'll be there. (except for Glyphicons, I recommend you searching up how to insert icons to websites using ""fontawesome"", took me a while to find out). With only being at Module 3, I was able to make websites that looked decent, but meh.Module 4:Oh boy, this is where the sea becomes the ocean and waves become tsunamis; first of all, I found it a bit confusing despite having knowledge on a similar programming language (LUA, not so similar but it's a programming language). The Module 4 assignment is a complete trick, you don't even need the other 2 sayHello.js and sayGoodbye.js files if you think hard enough, which really feels good when you do.Module 5:Well, Module 5 has around 4 hours worth of content (very short if you ask me), and AJAX is pretty important in a website. This is where if you have ADHD, you'll have a incredibly hard time, because here every information is going to influence whether you'll spend 30 minutes on the assignment, like expected or spend 4 days searching stack overflow on how to make a random number generator. Overall, great course, the first 3 Modules shouldn't be a challenge to anyone, I'm 13 and I went through it, so no excuses about being too young or something. ",0,2,Zhai_,91199005

My older brother at 68 tried to take on a similar online course but discontinued after a week so I was kinda scared getting into it. I appreciate the fact that Yaakov was straightforward in all the lectures and really kept in mind that everybody was a newbie. It helps that each lecture is short and focuses on just 1 or 2 concepts. After 2 weeks, I then felt more confident to continue. I highly recommend that each student invests in any of the recommended textbooks to gain a more in-depth understanding of the concepts and for additional practice tests. I got a 2nd hand copy of Jennifer Robbins' textbook from Amazon and it helped me a lot, but I had to take the course slower as I was absorbing both the online lectures and the textbook lessons. I really laughed hard at the invitation to be a mentor... really? Javascript bangled my brain, I think...  Anyway, thanks a lot... I am moving on to apply what I learned in developing a simple online learning platform for youth farmers in the Philippines on Agroecology and Organic Farming, in the vernacular.

The thing is, this course was made a long time ago and some technologies discussed here are not updated according to the present scenario, like the latest Bootstrap version is 5 and I had a lot of difficulties in replicating the website that Mr. Yaakov was developing. But it was my own choice, the course didn't require me to make that website, I wanted to do it just to make myself understand the course better. I didn't had much difficulty apart from the Bootstrap queries and Stack Overflow forums helped a lot.So, I will leave you with this suggestion: Yaakov's teaching and explaining skills are awesome, but just keep your mind open to this fact that some things like Bootstrap are not relevant to the present scenario and you should be ready to replace that knowledge with updated knowledge from new courses, but definitely go through this course for a better hold of the basics... :)",0,5,Ekampreet Singh,55348540

This is probably one of 
the best online courses that anyone can get not only in Coursera but 
across any online teaching platform. And it's all because of having an 
wonderful course instructor as Yaakov Chaikin.
 Thank you Sir. You have made me understand the fundamental concepts of 
HTML, CSS Framework and JavaScript so much easily and precisely. Also as
 you said, not many computer science courses take us on a field trip! 
Although virtual, it was fun. And that's what added the cherry on the

Bootstrap 4 has been released, and ES6 has been widely supported. Although the essense does not change, I'm still looking forward to the updates of the course.Secondly, I'd like to point out that objects are not passed by references in Javascript. Just like in Python, the value of the reference is copied and passed. Sometimes this makes a difference.Finally, the book recommendation in every week is the same.

The latter weeks get more intense and may require a few resets...but stick with it; you'll get the concepts down pat and your problem-solving skills will improve if you keep focus and finish your projects.

I had minor confusion at the beginning because GitHub looks different than on the videos, but that was because time has passed and GitHub page changed. Not  a big deal. Also, when the course was made VS Code was not as well developed as it is today.

More like boot camps that build skills and confidence for entering into the job market more easily and more successfully.

I encourage you to consider offering  another class or expand the existing program that teaches advanced Html, Css, JavaScript employing User Experience and User Interface design skills.

They require some thought, but adhere to the topics in the course without assuming additional knowledge. The exercises are difficult and take more time than the listings. But the reference materials are helpful and the online forums are very useful in clarifying points of uncertainty. I found some of the assignment descriptions, especially in modules four and five, to be unclear and it took some additional research to understand the intent of the task.The registration process and installation of the needed software was clearly explained and easy to accomplish. The software worked well with the course and enhanced the learning experience. I especially liked the way BrowserSync worked with Sublime Text and Chrome. The Chrome analysis tools are very useful.

Before the course I knew something about HTML, CSS and Javascript but not too much.  First week is a piece of cake. Second week was also easy but I did not have a strong logic about the ""box model"" before, after the second week I had it.With third week things went in a strange way, but in a positive one. We started to code a ""real"" website (yeah you'll understand if you enroll) from scratch. This was invaluable for me. Reading documents is something, but watching lectures, interact with the real code, try and see way, using Git and Github,  getting great tips, I mean doing real stuff is invaluable. Fourth week is also not so hard for me since I have some basic Javascript history. And Javascript section is not so detailed and difficult, but just for one week it was beyond OK, it was great. Even in basic info you'll learn something. Fifth week is a total stranger for me since I don't know anything about Ajax or dynamic loading pages style. Ok, I know what was Ajax but just the name :) So, after the week I've learned those. At least the concept itself and how to implement it in a simple web site. But I must confess, I watched the videos twice and examine the codes again and again to fully understand what we are doing and how we are doing. Because a week is not enough for this and things go faster. But hey, lectures are recorded and you can watch them again right :) And you have all the codes!Beauty of this course is all the weeks and assignments are related and integrated. So you learn something, finish the assignment. Next week, you learn new things, get new assignments but continue the last week's job. Yeah, you remember the real web site part? And of course last but not least Mr. Yaakov Chaikin is a great instructor and person! He has an excellent way of teaching. So, if you are a total newbie or someone who is beginning of his journey like me do not hesitate to enroll this course.

The delivery is clear and engaging, so if you're interested in the matter, you won't get bored. The material covers all the right topics for an up and coming web designer, providing the right amount of information for a confident start and plenty of pointers where and how to expand on the knowledge provided. Another point in favor is the frequent and valuable engagement of the professor and his teaching assistants in the discussion forums, unlike some other courses that feel abandoned by the staff once they start.

Enseña todos los detalles necesarios para que tu como estudiante no quedes con ""el puente con tablas menos"" como es común en cursos de youtube hecho por aficionados. Se nota la calidad que imparte tanto el profesor como el respaldo por la universidad en que lo que más importa, es que tú aprendas.Saludos!",0,0,Ariel Moreno,13676952
