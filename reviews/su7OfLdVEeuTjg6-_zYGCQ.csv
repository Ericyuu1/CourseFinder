15600929~COURSE!~su7OfLdVEeuTjg6-_zYGCQ,1662967367946,1,0,"I​ am too angry with this curriculum to write anything constructive at this time. The lack of quality/accuracy/usefulness of this material is scary since so many people use Intuit products to support their livelihoods. Instructors, your job is not to evade questions or answer with corporate responses like ""We are looking into it"", we know it is not happening. It does not take six months to fix a typo - I know, I wrote training material for a living, but it doesn't take six months. As an instructor, your job is to educate, to guide the learner through the subject. That means actively engaging in discussion and providing more definitive answers to questions. If there is an issue with a question in a quiz or lab, don't just browbeat the learner with some obscure platitude. Instead, since questions are tied to specific sections of the course, suggest to the student they go back to the supporting section for review.Actually create a workbook that has the student apply the concepts taught in all the courses to doing the books for the same company. You kind of did it in the course presentations. This way, the student would have a consistent enviroment to work with eg common set of accounts to be used.R​eview your instructions. They are not clear. They read like somebody rushed through typing something in without thinking about it. if your intending to have something broken in a worksheet, it is best to clearly indicate it, because it is clear that what is presented does not reflect real world. And for learners just starting, that isn't needed. I was shocked at the number of people tagged as unenrolled!D​rop the talking heads. It got so tiresome listening to people who I had no idea of who they were and their signficance the program. This is a subject that requires a lot of hands on practice to master. A workbook with lots of problems would have been a lot better. Also a talking animated character teaching/guiding through all these modules really dropped the credability of this material. Honestly what was presented by these people was no different than what I was reading in ""Bookkeeping for Dummies"".",0,1,Jeffrey Rhodes,15600929

107855171~COURSE!~su7OfLdVEeuTjg6-_zYGCQ,1656966709237,2,0,"TIPS FOR CASE STUDY BELOW!Here are some tips for the case study;The main problem with the case study was the trial balance but I figured out that you had to use the numbers and values in the unadjusted trial balance as your starting values and then subtract and add the amounts from the journal entries to get the correct numbers for your trial balance. Your trial balance number should end up being nice and clean whole numbers. Trial balance should be 1,161,000 or 1,163,000 . My debits and credits were off by 2k but these values were alright as the financial statements turned out fine and I ended up getting all the right answers with these numbers.Also retained earnings is net profit. And the amazon refund you debit cash and cred general and administrative expense.Overall don't take the assesment too seriously and try to overanalyze your mistakes and go to a granular level. Just take it easy and do what you can. It is not meant to be perfect as it was not created even close to perfect in the first place. Use this course to learn as much as you can and leave it adn that and move on. It is only $55 so not a bad deal overall. The information in the whole course is indeed wortt $55 or more which is great. We will learn more and keep growing as we actually apply the concepts that were touched on in the course in our real practice. Academia is bs, the real world is where it is at.For the intuit team: You guys need to step it big time. First off, take out the cringe and annoying animated character lady. I guarantee she is the biggest problem in the entire program. Next, make sure that your interactive activities are polished and coded properly becasue a lot of them tweak and have many problems. Next, really work on the creating good case studies and prepare your students to nail them by giving mini case studies or a lot more deep and challenging practice throughout the entire course. Also incorporate test prep so that the students can actually pass the pearson exam.Hope the students and intuit gains value from this feedback and if we all continue to improve we can make massive progress in life brah.

Some ideas aren't really talked about in depth until later, but you really need that earlier on. And, lastly, there's no practice test or anything at the end. The activities are helpful and I appreciated them, but in no way do I feel confident in spending $150 on the certification exam because I have no idea what to expect for it. There are a lot of formulas to learn and a lot of information that apparently even certified bookkeepers keep notes about (according to commentary in the videos), rather than memorizing.
