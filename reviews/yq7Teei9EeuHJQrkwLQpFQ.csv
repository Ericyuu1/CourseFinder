Also wasted a lot of time trying to copy the boilerplate into Jupyter Notebook itself. I wasn't (from what I could tell) informed to just ""run"" the code within the page. The concepts were conveyed well in small steps for the most part. Would recommend once you know what's going on but it was really frustrating starting out. ",0,0,Marta,120200864
