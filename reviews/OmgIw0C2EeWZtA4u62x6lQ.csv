I have enjoyed listening to his video lectures a lot.A prospective course participant should know that Goerben Moerman is a very different lecturer. (Despite being all over the screen as he mastered jumping and leaning forwards :-)) As a 'Lecturer of the Year 2011' at the Uni. of Amsterdam, one can assume he is a good story-teller and a passionate actor.   However, there are some minor drawbacks in his approach. His teaching approach is a bit less systematic, compared to Annemarie Zand Scholten's one from the Course 1 in the specialization. There were too many video cuts (I believe due to his digressions), so I felt that sometimes patchworks lack coherence. For instance, he used a term 'denaturalist', obviously explained in the cut scenes, so the unexplained term suddenly appeared making a content not fully comprehensible. Moreover, his explanation in the video 2.6 was not well done - I had to carefully examine what he had wanted to say in one occasion.He goes slowly through the material, which many would appreciate.I liked a lot his (longer) video on Abduction (Week 3). This is a must to see, even if you are not interested in Qualitative Research Methods.All audio recordings have been made in a room with a rather bad acoustics. For instance, Annemarie's audio recordings were perfect from the technical perspective. The lecturer does not patronize or ex cathedra, which is the best. He has been using frequently the adverbs 'perhaps' or 'maybe' letting ourselves to make a judgement.The worst part of the Qualitative Research Methods is the Week 5 assignment, which was too boring, time consuming, and not quite understandable.Despite few drawbacks that I have mentioned, I have learnt a lot from this course and I strongly recommend it to everyone.

I am relatively new to the field of qualitative research, having previously done mostly quantitative research, and this course has given me a great introduction. I did not have time to do the full course though, had only several days to watch all videos (which did not take too long, and the readings were not 10 min as stated probably by default on the Coursera platform, but one sentence and then the reference lists linked to citations on the slides); unfortunately I did not have time to do the exams/assignments, which sounded quite useful though.I loved the fact that Moerman managed to get at least some order into the endless variety and contradictions within the so complex field of qualitative research, each time showing his great knowledge by citing a wide range of historical and current experts. I am not an expert myself, and am not in a position to rate the quality of the content, but given that he gave so many different views, it seems to me that he is extremely competent and at the same time tried to be fair to different approaches and different research paradigms.Moerman has a great talent in presenting complex issues clearly using different categories and graphs that were depicted nicely on the slides. I also liked the cartoons and other drawings. Many of the categories and themes were explained using great examples from the literature that prevented me from getting bored. First and foremost though, it has been the great enthusiasm and his true desire to teach and make you understand, which has made the course so interesting and memorable. Often he would jump up and down and run towards the camera to emphasise a point - probably to the great despair of the person behind the camera, who had to often cut the film; he would also often stand in front of the slides, covering some of the images/content, which is why the quality of the videos is not perfect in a technical sense - I did not get  motion sickness from it though (which I always do if something is filmed by hand camera) - so my compliments to the person at the camera and thank you to all involved for allowing Moerman to remain natural without 'forcing him into form'/ a stiff person - because then his lectures would have lost all of his charm. Overall, it is not only his charm and the great slides, but the depth and honesty and presentation of different views in a clear and visual way that made me love this course and long for more - e.g. additional courses about all the other types of qualitative research methodologies and methods that he could not go into for time reasons and giving further examples in more detail.A big thank you to everyone involved in the development of this course!!",0,0,Sima Berendes,16660423
