4384925~COURSE!~hhFDsQ72EeWPhwrBf2tcNQ,1577815492151,5,0,"Tip: If you want to truly gain from this course, work on the optional ""Honours"" assignments. Those are non-trivial and make you go back and forth and revise the material before you can find a solution. I felt ashamed when I had to refresh some basic math skills to solve some of them. Prof. Kandori's teaching is truly enjoyable to follow. He explains all the concepts very clearly and doesn't overload you with a lot of information at once, and if you follow the course taking notes along the way, you can build some solid foundation in Game theory. In the last module, the Prof. also kindly provides references to further learning materials along with his brief assessment of what target audience should take which material. I felt really good about having earned a Honours certificate in this course. I recently enrolled in Coursera Plus, and I am planning to build on this and have a rock star 2020!",0,10,RAGAVAN NATARAJAN,4384925

If you begin the course, do not stop - the first two weeks lay out the basics, without requiring much math background (leaving that for the Stanford/UBC course which is quite good).  But the final two weeks are eye-opening as they show uses and discoveries based on game theory, especially with regard to social and economic concerns.  Prof. Kandori has done research in these areas and has passion for them - don't miss those sessions.  The only drawback to this course might be that it is a bit slow, with much repetition, a useful technique in the classroom but not quite as effective in this online mode.  But speeding up the videos one notch might help :)Were Prof. Kandori to speak here (the San Francisco Bay Area) I would eagerly attend - and his ties to Stanford might make that possible - my antenna are raised for such an occurrence.",0,1,Larry L English,5851279
