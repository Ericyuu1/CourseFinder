Well known issues with random numbers, but no updates. Incorrect book references which will let you implement formulas other than intended.

The methods you learn about though are more exciting, since they go beyond the introductory academic stuff that is not really used in production.  I can easily see how Q-Learning, SARSA, and DynaQ architectures are usable in the real world.  Programming assignments are also very similar, but just a **little** bit more challenging.
