2955887~COURSE!~c20ET-PsEeavJhLJu8-cXg,1578781026915,1,0,"Updated review. Initially I have provided a 4-stars score for the course and the initial review is below.At the same time I want to make sure this review can be viewed by the people who aim to get the certificate for THE WHOLE SPECIALIZATION, therefore I give a bad score to attract attention of those learners.If you plan to finish the whole specialization, please be informed that the 4th course from the specialization is missing FOR M.ORE THAN 2 YEARS ALREADY! so most probably you will not be able to complete it in order to have the certificate.Please take into consideration this information if it might influence your decision whether you want to subscribe to the whole specialization or not.Kind regards.Initial review:I have some critiques for this course. First - overall quite good course, but lacks some structure and logical connection in the beginning between the Lean principles and Lean startup principles. You kind of learn about Lean startup principles and then in the quiz you have questions about general Lean principles. Other thing I didn't like - was the additional materials added to the course. I had the feeling that Lean Software Development process wasn't a strong part of lecturer's expertise and he was ""outsourcing"" it too often - was bringing videos and examples developed by other consultants more than usually.Third thing is that annoys me the most. Because of this I was even going to give the smallest score possible to the course. I am speaking about the fact, that the quizzes have questions which don't have answers in the learning materials. This is not the first time the lecturer makes the same mistake - other courses from this specialization also included quizzes with questions that were not reflected in the learning material, but in the previous cases you was able to maneuver by using logic. This time it was not possible. For example, how do you know which diagram to use  for the 5 Whys technique if nothing was told about about it in the lesson?! - I double checked. Extremely annoying!",0,1,Olga GAGAUZ,2955887
