12737855~COURSE!~KkFzW9N7EeesLg4eQ_-o2A,1658857444998,1,0,"It's a very high level course, but that could be forgiven.What is annoying is that the information presented and information tested during intermediate quizes is out of sequence. Furthermore, some test questions are formulated very unclearly.Finally, the final test based on open questions leaves too much room for incomplete answers while still getting all the points. Worse, when grading, sometimes you have options to only give 2,5/5 or 5/5 points, yet not 0/5 for completely wrong questinos...All in all this results in even lower value of the accreditation.",0,2,Dominic Parewijck,12737855
