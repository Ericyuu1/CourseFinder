The idea, as I understood it, was to choose something small and relate it to something of cosmic consequence.  I think the explanation of the ""Liitle Big"" idea was fascinating, but it needed to be more carefully explained for it to be understood by those whose first language is not English.

53086299~COURSE!~m4P_9jaeEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,1611489097610,3,0,"Well, this course is about everything and nothing and the same time. I want to thank the profs who took the lectures on Week 1 and the prof who told about the religion, because it was the most interesting lectures as for me. The rest was not very interesting and even boring. As for me, it is better to consider the topics in detail than to try to snatch pieces from the history and briefly tell about everything. I would like more examples and conretics.The worst part of this course for me is Little Big History assignment. Lecturer has told that you can write whatever you want but linked it with the theme of the lecture. You can write a very creative essay, but other testing students do not think so and will give you low grades. This is not an objective grades. Besides, it's hard to write an essay every week when English isn't your native language.I think that there are more interesting lectures on YouTube dedicated to the development of the world from the Big Bang until today.",0,1,Inna Belozerova,53086299

However, the way the quizzes are marked is not well thought out,  as only one point is allocated to each question, regardless of how many correct answers you give in the multiple choice.  So the final mark is not an accurate assessment of how much knowledge you have acquired that week.  On other Coursera courses I have taken, you are given one point for each correct answer, which is a fairer way to test your learning.It is also quite frustrating how the final assessment is marked.  On other courses, the peer assessment is anonymous but on this course you can see who has marked your assignment.  So, if you have been critical of their work they have the opportunity to mark your assessment down! You also have to wait quite a long time for someone to mark your assignment simply because not that many students make it through to the final week, given the harsh marking of previous quizzes. If you look at Week 4 Forum it is full of students asking for someone to mark their assignment!!! This is not a great situation.",0,2,Gilly Mills,54252013

to E.Ouaedackers 
Dear Dr. Quaedackers,
                I have just finished the Coursera course, Big History:  From the Big Bang until Today, and found it a very worthwhile experience.  If you can bear with me, I have a few (hopefully) helpful comments; if not please metaphorically shred this email and place in the bottom of your canary cage.  The canary is optional.
The course was well organized both per presentation and per weekly topic, and the tempo of the course was appropriate.  Having a transcribed text to accompany each presentation was quite helpful, although at times, due to the text being voice-prompted, the accents of the various speakers produced unique spellings, initially difficult to recognize as English.  [Please note that were the arrangement reversed and, say, my American English accent were to be voice-morphed into Dutch spelling, who knows what would be produced!  So, this last is not a criticism but rather an observation.]  In particular, I found the combination of both a narrative approach to Big History and a conceptual one, the concepts being embedded within the overall narrative, a very effective mode of presentation, especially with the ultimate expectation of students producing a Little Big History on some personally valued topic. 
With regard to the presenters themselves, all come off as experts who are genuinely motivated by the nature of their fields of study and by their responsibility to present in your course.  While I did not complete a head-count of the total number of presenters, it was certainly in double digits and possibly in the twenties; what a nightmare to schedule and organize!  My hat is off to you and your staff on this last point.  While time per presentation is of the essence and the focus of the course was well established, it would have been interesting to have each presenter, either as a portion of their presentation or as a text addendum to the presentation, comment on the perspective that Big History gives to their specific research.  Moving on…….
My formal training is in biology and at the graduate level, zoology with emphasis in ecology and evolution.  This last is mentioned so you can take what follows with a grain of salt, i.e. my comments are biased by my background and are unnecessarily ladened with expectation.  It would have been nice if the portion of the course dealing with the history of life spent a bit more time on mechanisms, specifically with respect to recovery from mass extinctions, and it would have been equally nice if comparisons of evolved complexity of succeeding ecologies were made between mass extinctions.  Penultimately, after the Permo-Triassic extinction Lystrosaurus is the only large terrestrial vertebrate to appear in the fossil record.  This poses some interesting ecological problems with respect to food source, predators, pathogens, and biomass, perhaps worth some consideration in a future version of the course.  [Note here that Wignall (2015) suggests a slough of extinctions occurring over 80 million years beginning just prior to the P-T boundary and extending to the end of the Triassic and into the early Jurassic.  Also note that Wignall suggests that biomass recovers quite quickly while biodiversity requires significantly more time to recover.  If correct, this is an interesting phenomenon associated with recovery from collapse of complex systems in general!]  Finally, convergent evolution should be considered more thoroughly both in temporal sequence, e.g. Phytosaurs to Crocodilians and with respect to the convergence of adaptive radiations themselves, e.g. Marsupials v. Placentals.
In closing, your course is excellent, and I would recommend it without qualification to anyone wishing a broader perspective of who we are, where we’ve been, and where we’re going.  In conjuction with your course, I purchased Prof. Spier’s Big History and the Future of Humanity and found it a very worthwhile companion. The assigned writings were excellent and the capstone project very effective.  Well done here!  I do however have some concerns regarding the use of multiple choice questions, particularly when the payoff for being “correct” is so heavily skewed toward making errors; reward for learning should not be so constrained.  Also, the position of Big History within formal academics, something that is currently only now being established, might be a valuable discussion topic to consider in the future.  Further, asking students to submit their own unanswered Big History questions at the end of the course might be enlightening to both the student population and the presenters.  Beyond these few admittedly narrow concerns and as mentioned previously, this course is excellent.
Many, many thanks for a first rate educational experience,

Tony Harper
