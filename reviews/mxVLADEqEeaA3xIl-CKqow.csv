I wish the course put more attention to explaining sentence structure, and how and when to use modal particles. The volume of the lecture videos and the text dialogues is also very inconsistent. For example, the intro to the lectures are very loud compared to the voice of the teacher. Also in the audio that accompanies the written texts, there are background noises in some of them.
