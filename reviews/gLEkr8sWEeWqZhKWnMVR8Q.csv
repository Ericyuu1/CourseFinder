68255621~COURSE!~gLEkr8sWEeWqZhKWnMVR8Q,1601394850746,3,0,"Content is very well organized, and comprises a lot of vocabulary from different HSK levels (about 3 to 5, mostly). I would say the pace is kind of slow, but the new vocabulary review is very clear and complete (if you took the course ""Chinese for HSK6"", you can see how this course is much more effective in giving you less vocabulary with more examples). I would definitely recommend this course if you have an HSK3 or 4, might be too simple for higher levels but still it is a good recap and I learned something new.The main issue with the course is the fact that very few people are on it. I completed the coursework in 1 week, but had to wait 2 more weeks to obtain all the needed review, and it is frustrating.",0,0,Alberto Pepe,68255621
38075880~COURSE!~gLEkr8sWEeWqZhKWnMVR8Q,1586691920188,4,0,"Thanks for the course! It was both useful and interesting.Let's now focus on some points (sorry for my English):1) This course is good for students between HSK-2 and HSK-3. If your level is higher, you can find these lessons boring (but I'm not sure if you're able to understand what the teacher says). I'm about HSK-4 level right now, so it took me about a week to finish the course. Except for some interesting phrases, I've already known most of the words.2) There are some minor mistakes in the quizzes (for example, week 5, task 5.4). That was really unexpected, I hope the teacher will check all the problems. I read some ""week discussions"" and found that problems with wrongs answers were common.3) There are very few students joining this course, so be ready TO WAIT WEEKS before you have works from other peers to check, as well as someone can check your tasks and you can finish the course.Still, I liked this course. Thanks, teacher! Good luck everyone!",0,0,Oborina Ekaterina,38075880

Но зачем мне на проверку даётся тьма работ (проверив более десятка, остановился), да ещё и работ, написанных год и более назад? Какой в этом смысл? Три необходимых работы я проверил, а система настаивает на проверке. Странная история. Плюс, русскоязычная поддержка в реальном времени всё же нужна. На мой вопрос про ошибку так ответа и не дождался. Странно, в общем... Вопросы организационные. По материалу вопросов нет - всё хорошо.",0,0,BUTENKO ALEXEY,24276931

This is recommended for those with at least HSK 3-4 fluency. The only downside is that few people join the course, so you'll have to wait longer for the peer reviews.
