I thought there were a wide and interesting range of topics.  I wish the quizzes would have had a little more info before taking them, such as some questions may have 2 or 3 correct answers.  That was unclear to me, so I had to retake them several times before figuring that out.  I also would have liked more help on the final exam project.  I asked a question but there wasn't anyone in the discussion to answer before the submission deadline, so I am still unsure if I completed it correctly.  Other than that, the course was a lot of fun and I enjoyed it.",0,1,Chantel Washington,52351963
