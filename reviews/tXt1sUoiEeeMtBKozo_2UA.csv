35561064~COURSE!~tXt1sUoiEeeMtBKozo_2UA,1651510741167,1,0,I think the course content itself is fine. But there is really no instructor or administor to monitor this course. Your peer review assignment will never be reviewed because there are no one else taking this course. You will wait forever for it to be reviewed and you have nowhere to ask help for. ,0,0,Zhi Li,35561064
43689851~COURSE!~tXt1sUoiEeeMtBKozo_2UA,1579908304925,4,0,"I really liked all the content of the 5 courses. The last exercise we did in the Capstone was great and helped me to go back and revisit several learning topics and solidify what I`ve learned. However, why just 1 exercise? and why not a full complete tax calculation?I suggest (and would love to take) an extra module for advanced practice, with at least 5 (ideally 10) hypothetical cases like Bobby, to use the different rules and perhaps all the content. Just my 2 cents, overall highly recommend the course but wish that the course objective was expanded to provide more practical exercises in a separate ""training"" moduleRegards ",0,0,Guilherme Carrascoza,43689851
