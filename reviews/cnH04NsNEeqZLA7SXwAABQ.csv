4384925~COURSE!~cnH04NsNEeqZLA7SXwAABQ,1605577584842,2,0,"There are few clear mistakes in the material that needs to be corrected. As a computer scientist, I cringed at seeing  ""Hashing is a process used to encrypt data"" in one of the slides. That's fundamentally a wrong definition of hashing, one that even CS undergrads won't make. It's clear the authors don't understand CS or cryptography.That said, as audience, if you have no idea whatsoever about blockchain before taking this course, you would learn a thing or two, or at least get some familiarity with the basic terminologies. But if you have been following blockchain on the news and other media for quite some time, this course won't offer you any benefit. There's bare superficial mentioning of several concepts, leaving you wanting to do your own research - And then there's blatant mistakes like ""Hashing is a process used to encrypt data"", which makes you feel good that they didn't expand further on certain topics they may not have understood.  If you are looking for a decent course, I strongly recommend the ""Blockchain Business Models"" from Duke University. ",0,3,RAGAVAN NATARAJAN,4384925
