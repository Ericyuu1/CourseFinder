Thus with reservation I enrolled in this course. And what a delight it has been!! Mr. Biss is passionate, articulate and an stellar pianist, especially with slow movements(his Opus 109. put me in a trance the first time I heard it). I've learned to appreciate Beethoven's music as well as himself as an idealist dreamer, once having let go of my preconceived idea of what beautiful music should be(my musicical twin-flame was and still is Mozart). I've discovered some of the most breathtakingly pretty melodies in the world thanks to Mr. Biss. Beethoven's music in comparison to other composers is that it's too human: passion, discontentment, fury, love, loneliness, yearning and struggle. I feel like I've been invited to a private club of people that is my own kind.Thank you, Mr. Biss. You truly made a great difference in my life. ☆ﾟ.+:｡ﾟラブ(oゝω･o)ラブﾟ.+:｡ﾟ☆            ",0,0,Michel Q.

Both go above and beyond my wildest dreams, leaving my expectations so far as to be unable to recall them. I learned not only about Beethoven the composer; but developed a greater appreciation for him and his music, for his predecessors and those who followed his footsteps, the sonata form and many other forms, and perhaps more important to ponder about the nature of music itself and it's relevance in our life. His presentation of  the musical question, quotation, program music, and the notion of ""jokes"" exposed and explained a musical paradigm far broader than affective or cerebral qualities. It stems from these observations that there is a very rich and capable language with its own strengths and weaknesses. In this case, the history of Beethoven's sonatas is then a very close look at a critical point in the life of this language that binds multiple stages into a consistent whole. This subjects quasi universal nature, spans multiple cultures and allows us to look into snapshots of the experience of life. And this presentation has provided me with the necessary training to be aware of this and also to slowly delve further into this subject. And I find this in itself to be a very significant reason why to study music in the first place.My deepest thanks to all who made this great work possibleWither music?Most certainly :)",0,1,Eduardo Alejandro del Corral Lira,2601082
