29067817~COURSE!~sIzu4R5yEeaCoQrM2bnbCQ,1608806436235,1,0,"With all due respect, this is the worst course I followed on Coursera.
- First of all week 1 is extremely basic. I would think that most people learning Julia are coming from Python and/or data-science background with programming knowledge. Yet the week 1 feels like for people with no programming experience.
- But then week 2 goes directly into plotting! Plotting is the last phase of any data analysis. Before that, you need to manipulate your data and there is a lot to learn about as Julia's Array seems very different than Python or Numpy's arrays but is absolutely not covered.
- Worse, week 3 has nothing to do with Julia. I appreciate having a real world example but most of the lectures are explaining epidemiology SIR models and teach nothing more about Julia. In terms of learning Julia, that entire week can be skipped.
- Week 4, which should have been before week 2 is more interesting going into DataFrames and data manipulation. But again, I think there's a lot to teach first about basic Julia data types like Arrays, Vectors, Sets... 
An example. In week 4 there is a code doing the following on DataFrames dataA = data[data[:Treatment] .== ""A"", :] But never in the course is it explained that the period, when prefixing a function or operator is used to indicate broadcasting (performing the operation element wise).
In short, the course fails on teaching any of the important specificities about Julia.
And on top of that, as other mentions, it is outdated.
