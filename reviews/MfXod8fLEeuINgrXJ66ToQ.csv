However, if you are seeking a little bit of deep information, it won't satisfy you. But, for me, as someone who doesn't have an idea of psychological abnormalities, it was a helpful, basic course. Also, the length of the course was ideal, it was not too short, and it was not too long. The lecturer's statements were clear and understandable, especially when it's considered I'm intermediate in English.",0,0,Merve Tutkun,68426602

I do question, however, if the price for the certificate of this single course is worth it.
Sadly, most information (except for the most interesting parts ""Foundations of Empathy"") are accessible on the university's website for free. 
I, personally, enrolled in the Abnormal Psychology Specialisation, so I did not have to pay $40 for the certificate but will most likely pay $40 for the whole specialisation (finishing it in a month by doing some stuff everyday). I guess, I would feel less happy about the content, if I payed for each course individually.",0,1,Tom S.,100350149

38116800~COURSE!~MfXod8fLEeuINgrXJ66ToQ,1671030413505,5,0,"Hello everyone.I will say it briefly and clearly. You surprised me in a very positive way. Difficult course material, a lot of information on the names of diseases and disorders, a lot of percentages and similar concepts of disorders, a lot of information regarding the establishment of treatment, but all in all the course material was presented clearly, concisely, unobtrusively and at no time did it go into the unnecessary backwaters of the lecturer's personal thinking rather, it held onto its strongholds in what abnormal psychology is and what disorders and mental illnesses it contains. As indicated in the first module of this course, it is very difficult to precisely determine what is normal and what is abnormal. Your guiding thought was to clarify, to give insight, not to confuse, not to burden, but still to have basic guidelines about what abnormal psychology is....Therefore, only praise for this course and of course I will continue to another course of Specialization in Abnormal Psychology.If I had to rate this introductory course and give a rating of 1-5 stars, I give Introducing to Abnormal Psychology 7 stars just like the best equipped hotel because it was this introductory approach to Abnormal Psychology that gave me the motivation to go and study further in History of mental illnesses (the second part of the specialization) and to get to what is the most interesting Creating Behavioral Change (the third course of the specialization).So my rating for this course is: 7 *******",0,1,Sanjah,38116800
