27417886~COURSE!~YLyZ3BhOEeqmcg5cP6lwPw,1595394384268,1,0,You're at the mercy of your peers for grading of your final assignment. I am still waiting on a grade for my submitted project that is now locked and I am being told to re-enroll. Four weeks of my time totally wasted. ,0,1,Xen K,27417886
70638478~COURSE!~YLyZ3BhOEeqmcg5cP6lwPw,1606677219996,2,0,"I thought the assignments here need some improvement.  The final assignment for week 1 is much too difficult - specifically the tempo selected for the arpeggios (and suggested alternate picking).  This is much too challenging for most of the students who are submitting recordings.  In weeks 2 and 3, the content and assignments are much too easy.  Week 4 content is much too basic -- the content is basically just a checklist of things to think about before your rehearse/perform, all could be summarized is a simple document to download (not a whole 'week' of study) -- and to top it off, the final exam of week 4 asks the player to improvise a 12-bar blues solo over chords when no part of this course has once talked about soloing, improvisation techniques, soloing over the blues, nothing.  And the example offered by the instructor is clearly much more advanced than any student and therefore not helpful.  A strange disconnect between the high difficulty of the recording assignments and the extremely basic week to week course content.  If anyone can actually play those assignments well, they definitely don't need the content and vice-versa.",0,1,MMM,70638478

59782807~COURSE!~YLyZ3BhOEeqmcg5cP6lwPw,1600702113081,4,0,"This course is outstanding. I gave it only four stars because I couldn't
 figure out how to download the backing tracks. I don't know if it's a 
copyright issue or what, but I could record a much better quality 
product on my final assignments if you would let me download the backing
 tracks. If this is already an option, then you need to explicitly 
explain how to do so.",0,1,Bryan Blanchard,59782807
