It approaches the ideas for creating a truly new human/earth relationship that is the basis for an ecological civilizatin and a shared future for humanity. I have taken many Coursera courses and this course is by far not only the most engagin, but also the most challenging. This approach, linking various media elements including poetry and films, history and religious elements, is truly extraordinary and unique. I am the Dean of United Nations Non-governmental representatives over 40 years and this approach is only matched by the approach of the American Teilhard Association in its Yale Coursera offerings, which are fine ancillaries to this course. Professor Dr. Riemenschnitter is a great instructor. I would only suggest more modules on the art historical narrative, it is most engaging, as is the Swiss garden worth a second unit.",0,0,Richard Jordan,50949063

It has covered major environmental challenges faced by the Popular Asian countries of China, Japan and India. It touches upon the core environmental issue like (in case of India), how the environmental pollution could affect most adversely, the lowest rung of a given strata of population due to the practice of ""purity and pollution"" propagated by caste system.  Similarly, the course has touched upon the subtle issue like how environment is perceived and has been portrayed by novelists, poets, landscape artists in the present time in relation to the  earlier period. The course has done justice by giving equal emphasis to discuss both the complicated and subtle issues related to the  theme ""Asian Environmental Humanities: Landscapes in Transition"".
