899571~COURSE!~a9GgNyN0EeqHgQquzNaRiQ,1605738133425,1,0,"This course was quite disappointing. Although I expected more, given the track record of deeplearning.ai, this course felt rushed, and more of a practice in good coding rather than giving any knowledge or advanced intuition into the applications of AI in medical treatment. The first assignment in particular felt like it was mostly testing the student's ability to use fancy python package syntax than anything else. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this course at the point of competition (November 2020). I think students are far better learning the AI methods described in this course on their own, and only then learn their applications in medicine if this is required for their work. At the end of the day, data is data no matter what we're looking at. This is not to say that this course cannot improve in the future. To be fair, I would actually hope it does, to keep the great standard that deeplearning.ai has gotten us used to over the years. ",0,2,Andrei-Claudiu Roibu,899571

There are evident problems with the grader, reported by several users, and no one has been giving an answer since the course startup. If this is the quality of service provided by Coursera, there is non hope that I'll engage a new course in the future.",0,3,Vincenzo Maletta,30603632

21638356~COURSE!~a9GgNyN0EeqHgQquzNaRiQ,1610119625806,3,0,"I thought the course was well-taught and interesting, but I felt that it was more of an Introduction  -- Here are some things you can do with AI and ML techniques in the context of Medicient -- rather than a detailed explanation of how the techniques work and how to use them in practice, so probably more valuable for Medical professionals than AI/ML specialists.   It would be great to have some follow-on courses that get deeper into the technical details; the Coursera Deep Learning Specialization is a great example.In general, the programming exercises were valuable and engaging, but  I have a particular gripe with the grading:   In some cases, I had to spent quite a bit of time making micro-adjustments to my program text to satisfy the rather picky criteria of the grader, including one case were I had to remove spaces between tokens in an expression in order to pass.
