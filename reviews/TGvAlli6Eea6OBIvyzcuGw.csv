Nothing wrong with the content itself, but I felt the delivery was really dry, boring, and not terribly engaging.",0,0,Alex Gapud Baldwin,45826834

51944653~COURSE!~TGvAlli6Eea6OBIvyzcuGw,1587519634098,3,0,"The content was interesting and I found it useful for my career. What prevents me from rating it five stars, is that the audio was terrible. The presenters were not wearing a microphone and therefore the audio levels were not to the caliber of the other courses of the University of Pennsylvania. ",0,1,Liliana Danel,51944653
2888524~COURSE!~TGvAlli6Eea6OBIvyzcuGw,1550690942421,3,0,"I enjoyed the concepts included in this course. The format did not resonate with me as much as the other courses in this specialization. I prefer the lecture and interview format as I listen to much of the content like a podcast in my car. With this class, I found that I would often need to watch the video after listening to it after discovering that what was visible in the video did not always align to the audio. The discussion style of the content delivery seemed to make the videos feel longer and, frankly, just weren't as engaging as the lecture format in the other courses. This course does include video vignettes, which I enjoyed, and I thought were helpful for illustrating some points. Also, the course included a substantial number of readings or books that I wasn't able to access because they aren't available at my public library.",0,1,Katie Hoff,2888524
