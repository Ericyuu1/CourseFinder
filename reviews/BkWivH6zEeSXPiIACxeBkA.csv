2568474~COURSE!~BkWivH6zEeSXPiIACxeBkA,1453986040454,2,0,"The videos were ok, reading materials added some value, although about three years have passed since the launch of the original course and the materials are all the same. I expected that something new would be introduced to give it a bit more value. But what is very questionable is the architecture of the quizzes. On one hand it goes way beyond the simplicity of the lenght of the course, assume a mindset that extends well beyond this course, and on the other hand after doing the quizzes some times and observing the considered right and wrong answers, some of them - to say the least, are highly ambiguous and express a personal point of view of the instructor in what is right or wrong (what by itself is not very reasonable), and lack ultimately in objectivity regarding the materials covered. I am not by any means saying that the quizzes are hard or simple, I am saying that they lack objectivity and go beyond the scope of the materials and try to put the student on a state of trying to guess what the instructor's opinion is regarding the question at hand. In some cases the 'best' answer chosen is absurd. Highly questionable this approach. Again, I believe that evaluations should be challeging, but these quizzes are a bit esoteric, they lack objectivity.Nonetheless, it is important to say thank you for being present in this platform and having the will to put it together.

It is a course that, as the name suggests, tries to show the results of a ""critical"" approach to problems and to provide a guide to develop this approach. It is also able to propose with extraordinary ""novelty"" many interesting management topics. The use of business cases or simply sotric facts (from ancient Greece to the present day) as starting points from which to derive important business lessons makes the hours of these lectures extremely stimulating. Rolf Strom Olsen is a true magician in using Socratic maieutics to create in the interlocutor doubts and questions necessary for critical analysis and perhaps a less slavish view of the reality that surrounds us.

Despite the class being a few years old now (is this originally a class from 2013?), the topics discussed are still relevant today. The quizzes are challenging in that some change the questions when you take it a second time, some do not provide answers, and some you can only take once a day, forcing you to really know the topics students are being quizzed on. I really liked the in-class format of the video lectures as I could see the students and professor interact. I think if the lectures included more in-video quizzes and polls that would increase the students' understanding of the topics while allowing them to see what other people think as the lecture progresses.

The instructor's use of humor in a traditional classroom setting was also quite refreshing, as the interaction with the students is something that isn't present in most of the MOOCs that I've taken. I would like to see a second course offered on this topic by the same professor.",0,0,Dorothy L. McGee,6052395

Very useful indeed for my job as a mining manager, especially on FDRS which I've found never works well as people become yes-men to the boss.  And having a bit of a passion for late antiquity history, I was fascinated by the Roman grain trade and its lesson for us today. But wasn't something a bit similar set up between Constantinople and Egypt which ran successfully until the Persian invasions in the 7th century? ",0,0,L Morris,17503730
