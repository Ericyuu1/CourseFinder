After I figured out how to have both Contessa and the course up on the computer at the same time, and make entries in Contessa at the same time the teacher did, I thought I was really getting it.  What was difficult for me was S3 combined with S4.  The course kept saying if you don't know S4, use S3. It took me 3 times to pass this test, failing #2 and #3 two times, because I didn't understand until the test gave me a hint, that the surveillance slider would be the way to answer 2 & 3.

I finally closed my ConTESSA program and then reopened it so I had absolutely no connection to previous work.

COURSE NAME: Measuring and Maximizing Impact of COVID-19 Contact Tracing by John Hopkins University.  ISSUE: I am unable to successfully complete the following: Quiz: ConTESSA: Interactive Tool to Estimate Impact of Contact Tracing.

But, the Coursera QUIZ required answers do not correspond to the answers derived from the Contessa application worksheet.   TEST: I inputted data presented in the instructor's Interactive Tool to Estimate Contact Tracing Video via Coursera into the Contessa application worksheet and received different outcomes. It seem there are bugs or update issues preventing Coursera learning environment outcomes from duplicating in the provided Contessa application workseet. Resultantly, my answers derived in the Contessa application workseet will never match those expected in this Coursera QUIZ. GOAL: This issue needs to be corrected for future learners.
