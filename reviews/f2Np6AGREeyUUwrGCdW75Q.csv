Not only does it have writing errors practically everywhere, but it also has incorrect answers on a large number of the quizzes. I do not understand why the teacher or EC-Council would allow such a poorly constructed course to be released to the public. Someone should have proofread all the writing to fix the numerous spelling mistakes and broken English, as well as fact-checked all the quizzes to verify that the correct answers were credited and the incorrect answers weren't. The course seems outdated, too, by using older versions of the software. I only gave it two stars, since I'm sure someone possibly could get use out of the course because it does seem to go into pretty good depth (as far as I can tell) into making webpages using the MEAN stack, but the numerous flaws bring it down, so I can't recommend it at all, since there are better courses out there than this one.",0,1,Dan Tinsley,9447702
