6684228~COURSE!~eWdF_oGHEemfwRIsGCa-_A,1635811769097,1,0,"This specialization is false advertising. It does NOT prepare you for the Tensorflow certification exam. It’s especially disappointing after taking the fantastic specialization by Andrew Ng, and makes this specialization feel like a cheap cash grab by Coursera and DeepLearning.ai. This series of courses fails to prepare you for three reasons:1 – The certification exam is done on whatever is the current version of Tensorflow (v2.6 as of writing). You can’t expect a specialization like this to update every minor release, but much of the coding is still on the v1.X version!2 – The certification exam requires you to work in the PyCharm IDE. The IDE doesn’t even get a mention in this specialization and it is all done through Google Colab.3 – The material is covered at a very superficial level. I was hoping to walk out of it feeling confident in using Tensorflow on novel problems, but I’ve barely learned anything about Tensorflow that I didn’t already get from Andrew Ng’s specialization. There’re a few minutes of lectures (some weeks less than 10 minutes). The programming assignments are either pathetically easy, or lack any guidance on what to do (seriously sometimes there’s no instructions at all, you have to guess what to do by the variable names), or both.

That in itself is fine, I feel there are other places to learn the maths/intuition behind DL (e.g. the Deep Learning Specialisation) but I feel especially in this 3rd course the content really doesn't justify paying for it. For starters the explanations are very fast, hand wavy and don't go into any real depth other than just quickly explaining each line of the short notebooks (this can be useful). There is no discussion on how to improve the models or actually use this other than just pressing play in the notebook, the length of videos 17min per week is really not worth it, especially when better content can be found for free in Kaggle notebooks or on YouTube. There are also no graded exercises and after the first week they have given up on even providing suggested answers for the ungraded ones. The exercises don't test your TF understanding, just your basic Python loading of data and if you can copy from the example workbooks, they also have inconsistencies new untaught content and prone to errors that you haven't even been told could be an issue which means you just waste time being frustrated at not understanding what code you're even supposed to add rather than trying to understand the content.I really like Coursera in general so this experience won't change that, but given that the instructor has free content on the TF website and youtube channel it seems like a waste to pay for this course IMO.Hoping the 4th course will. be better",0,0,Jack Pegler,3903000

The content is high quality and really useful to help you build an NLP model from scratch.The lecturer guides you through the process adding a little piece each lesson, showing you the results and giving you the chance to try them yourself on a lot of different notebooks.While there are no graded assignments, you are still given the chance to build a model by yourself every week and put into practice everything you learned.This is a really hands-on series of courses and as such you have to seek theory explanation somewhere else. Despite that, to help the students who didn't take the Deep Learning Specialization there are numerous resources linked in case you wanted to develop a better understanding of the subject.I think that the best thing is that it's not a Tensorflow tutorial (you can find that online), but it helps the student develop a way of tackling NLP problems, explaining the building blocks necessary to create a model.
