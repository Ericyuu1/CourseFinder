I feel learning and education should be about sharing knowledge and experience. This course felt more like a game of hide and seek.  Quizzes and assignments required you to dig through the videos for one second mentions of functions or parameters.  Rather than finding the experience rewarding - more often I found it frustrating, as if Mathworks was trying to hide material and see if I could find it.  The videos are WAY to fast.  even when I reduced the playback speed to 0.75 I still had to start-stop often to keep up.  In the end I'm glad I took the course and I learned some valuable skills.
