16249799~COURSE!~N6IrVYBKEeiaBArj7jrDMA,1598272480534,1,0,"this was the worst mooc ive followed so far. The english was really poor and french should have been preferred. Exams were either too easy or too difficult. Little context is given about everything regarding actual applications. Too many things are taught without any context, and I recommend you to have a prior experience with IT before doing the course, otherwise you will get lost.",0,2,Cédric,16249799

24606665~COURSE!~N6IrVYBKEeiaBArj7jrDMA,1654765825331,3,0,"W​hile I enjoyed the course and learned some new things from it, there were several things that stopped me from giving it a higher rating.

1) Several of the quizzes relied on web applications that were broken. They returned server errors whenever I tried to use them. I was able to work around this problem by finding an alternative site with a similar application, or in one case calculating the required query by hand. I did report the issues using the ""Report Issue"" link on the page, but have seen no response at all. 

2) I felt that the depth of exploration of the subjects was very shallow and superficial. Semantic triples are a fascinating topic with a lot of potential, and had hoped to get a little more from the course than I did.


3) There was no real hands on experimentation to speak of. In the other Coursera MOOC I had previously done, each week had a series of assignments we had to write code for and submit both the code and the results for peer grading. I felt this allowed the course materal a much greater chance of sinking in. In this MOOC, the quizzes didn't really allow us to play and experiment to see if we could figure out how to solve problems ourselves.

I was particularly keen on learning more about semantic triples as I use them in my day job, but just felt this course could have been a lot more effective in teaching about them.",0,1,Geoff Skellams,24606665

26376998~COURSE!~N6IrVYBKEeiaBArj7jrDMA,1587140883322,3,0,"The course covers a lot of material in a short span and assumes more knowledge of programming and terminology than I expected so my views reflect my level of expertise coming into the course.  They could have offered deeper explanations of the content, especially explaining what each part of the code does.  I especially found the quizzes didn't give me enough feedback to help me get to the correct answer. Typically the quizzes suggested that I re-watch a video but the video wasn't related to the question.  A few other reviewers mentioned the difficulty in understanding the instructors as they have French accents.  I didn't find that to be too much of a problem but the transcriptions are sometimes off, for example, Turtle (a syntax and important concept) is often transcribed as total.",0,0,Anita Feidler,26376998
