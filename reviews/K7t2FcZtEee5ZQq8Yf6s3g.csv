75889496~COURSE!~K7t2FcZtEee5ZQq8Yf6s3g,1610121722197,4,0,"Course was very well thought out and provided a lot of great information.  One aspect that I believe needs adjusting is the format of some of the modules.  A few times, the peer graded assignment came before the tutorial on the subject and created some confusion.  For example, the explanation of Maslow's hierarchy came after the assignment and the explanation on how to rate the 3 sales people came after the assignment.  I think to make the course more effective these should be looked at and changed. Another item are the readings.  many of the websites where the articles are found have a limited free usage and then you need to obtain a subscription to read the articles.  not very 'friendly' if one does not want to purchase a full year subscription.
