I have thorough legal training in Copyright Law, yet I learned a great deal that was new regarding the real-life impact of those laws e.g. how to check the host country of both the website and the payment collector.  The section on copywriting games and software, despite the need to read it with the recent Supreme Court decision in Google v Oracle, is excellent.  Loved this course.",0,0,Maureen Spencer,10732954

It turns out to be an extremely informative course with an obviously passionate, knowledgeable, thorough, methodical, instructor. He is a born teacher who is not afraid of repeating concepts, facts, policies and conventions throughout the course and provide us with numerous detailed examples for each topic. There is maybe too much of a strong accent on the USA copyright system but at times an international outlook is thankfully given.  So in all I strongly recommend this course .
