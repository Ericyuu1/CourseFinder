597071~COURSE!~6gSQPpS9EeyUHQ6lIWLd9Q,1664869736176,3,0,"The course is an elementary introduction to customer-centric innovation and focuses primarily on why and what questions. The content doesn't go deep into exactly how you can do customer-centric innovation. Quizzes were very easy and if you have some basic familiarity with the topic, you can probably pass them without going through the course content. There were a few examples used here and there, but the course still lacked practical examples that would demonstrate the ideas in real life settings. ",0,0,Jukka-Pekka Ovaska,597071
