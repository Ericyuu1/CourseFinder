2861793~COURSE!~rKs1yZbpEeu46w60Xgbpdw,1626075775123,4,0,"The course was well-structured, informative and easy to follow. One suggestion for improvement I have is that a cheat-sheet or catalogue of sorts be provided within the course, which collates all the coding and syntax from the course onto one single space.
This is especially helpful while taking up the course as part of the specialization series. It isn't easy to remember precise code syntax after just one or two uses of a function. As I progressed through the courses in the specialization, I found myself having to return to previous courses and comb through the hands-on labs to retrieve specific codes, functions and syntaxes. This was time-consuming and wasteful, and can easily be remedied by a list of codes (with syntax) used in an entire course.
Apart from that, great effort by the team, and a big thank you to the creators, developers, moderators and testers!",0,2,Milcah Mary Joseph,2861793

I have gained a strong foundation in learning about data visualization in base R and ggplot2 library.  More amazing is that I can create shiny dashboards and build on my foundation to create web apps with them. Thank you IBM and Coursera.,0,1,Yusuf Zakaria,75704451
