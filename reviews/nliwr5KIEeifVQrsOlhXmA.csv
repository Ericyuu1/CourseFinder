31444917~COURSE!~nliwr5KIEeifVQrsOlhXmA,1667792393470,1,0,"The course content is interesting and there are a lot of interesting speakers to listen to. The problem is with the delivery if you don't speak French.The quizzes are not translated well and some of the questions don't make sense. Some of the choices are not even translated...That aside, when you do a quiz, there is no real feedback other than a percentage. This makes it difficult to actually learn from the mistakes and do better on the next quiz. I dropped out of this course in the third week. And it's a shame because the content was pretty eye-opening.",0,0,Aryan Seyedi,31444917

One major flaw: the quality of the content is somehow too irregular : it ranges from quite poor & too narrow to very interesting & well-explained. However a real 360° overview on a subject which is quite seldom.",0,0,Lionel ARNAUD,92948527

I would have appreciated more theory at the beginning of the course; in the current form the course is very France-focused - I believe it could be expanded more generally (and practicalities adapted to various local habits or by simple sign-posting toward relevant institutions).
