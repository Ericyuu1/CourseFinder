No example, no explanation, just *reading* the definition right off the text book using mathematical term. Math is complex, but it can be explained so everyone can understand. Third, I simply have a hard time understanding why the professor has to talk so fast and edit his video and/or make slides so text pops up in order to speed up the lecture instead of writing along as he speaks and explains (but there was no explanation in the lecture anyway so pausing the video to slow down wouldn't help).

Also, the concepts are elaborated on a seemingly random basis. Mean is left at ""center of mass"" like we just came out of physics 101 but the area under a curve is dragged out with random wood cutting analogies.

Incidentally, the dude who does the lectures for Khan Academy does a fantastic job and the lectures are a joy to watch, though some people might prefer something that moves less slowly and carefully and perhaps they would prefer something that glosses over the fundamental concepts more.

The chapters are short, but the first 16 or so should give you a good enough foundation to deal with about any intro stats class.

But Statistical Inference is a mixed bag for me.First, if you are thinking about this course, take some time reading the other reviews.  I find many of them resonate with my experience leading to 1/5 stars.One reviewer who gave 5/5 stars said they loved the course.  They suggested that other reviewers who gave low ratings are ones that dropped out. I don't find this to be the case.  Many of the low rating reviewers actually did pass the course and said very similar things as those who did not pass the course.  Another reviewer enjoyed Brian's dry humour. I must have missed the jokes after watching each video 5 times...For the record, I almost aced this course.  The reason for not getting 100% was because I was so annoyed with one of the quizes that I didn't bother taking it again to correct it.  I decided living with 8/10 correct questions was better than having a stroke while in the pursuit of two extra points. Yes, that is how much I hated this course.The first 2 weeks of the course were the worst.  I dropped out for about a month (because of life priorities).  Then I couldn't get motivated.  1 month turned into 2 months, then into 3 months. I basically took the entire summer off.  Finally I bit the bullet and completed the final 2 weeks.  The 3rd week of the course wasn't actually all that bad (though the quiz was terrible).  The 4th week felt like the first 2 weeks...terrible.(By the way, it's a mistake to take such a long break. I had to re-watch the first videos to recall things for the remaining quizzes).If you don't have some sort of statistical knowledge (or inherent aptitude), be prepared to work four times longer on the course.  For all your quiz and assignment time-to-completion estimates, multiply them by 4 or more.  Seriously, I spent probably 10 hours on the final assignment which said it should only take 2 hours.  Each quiz took me an entire Sunday afternoon  (My partner was not pleased). Now here is where things get awkward.  I hated the course .... BUT....I learned things that actually stuck. So in THAT regard, I give this course extra stars.  It accomplished something that some University courses could not.  I even found myself USING the new knowledge in real world problems.  So ironically, is that not a sign that it's ...dare I say...a GOOD course?Would I take the course again?  I actually might, but ONLY because of its place in the overall certification.  If you are a prospective student wondering if you should take the course as a standalone course, I don't think I could recommend it, because there are far better ways to learn.  In fact, just doing the Swirl lessons could be good enough.If you are a prospective student and you want the certification, then you'll HAVE to take the course. Why are you even bothering to read reviews?  So I'm giving the course 3/5 stars.  If I gave it 1 or 2 stars, my review would be clustered with the majority.  If I gave it 4 or 5 stars, I'd be lying.

I know this is a very shallow dive into the field, yet I have the feeling I could have learned more. The absence of judgment whether my calculations in the project were correct
 or not was confusing too me since in statistics it's more important to 
correctly interprete the result then to get the result. Calculation and 
interpretation of results should become routine and more different, practical, coding exercises would be very cool to have. Having that said, I still much appreciate the Data Science Specialization as a whole.

had put in a little bit of thought and effort into this module and tailored it
