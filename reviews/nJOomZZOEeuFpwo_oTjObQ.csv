51787771~COURSE!~nJOomZZOEeuFpwo_oTjObQ,1630974438455,1,0,"I went through the whole project and learned a lot about R that I didn't know before. It was amazing! I learned things that simplified the data exploration process that I've been puzzling about ever since I completed my capstone project! It simplified the whole thing and just gave me a lot of ideas to make the data analysis process more efficient and reliable. This gives me confidence about the insights and the data quality even before I present them! However, one problem was that the file used in this project cannot be accessed using the cloud workspace, so I can't follow with the instructor and just ended up watching the whole thing. Still, great value! I'm gonna leave a 1 star here and hope the instructor notices this, but all in all it was 5/5! :) ",0,0,Rutherford Rigodon,51787771
