26583221~COURSE!~OXqJcQo-EeWKzSIAC7Uk8A,1501597062019,4,0,"The course was
comprehensive and interesting overall. I do have some criticisms: genetic engineering
is viewed in a very negative light as well as conventional farming. The arguments
that were presented resemble rhetoric from certain consumer groups, instead of sound
science. I think it's important to get rid of this false dichotomy between scientific
innovation and sustainability as these can come together to provide actual
solutions to the problems facing the food system today. ",0,0,Javier Martinez,26583221
