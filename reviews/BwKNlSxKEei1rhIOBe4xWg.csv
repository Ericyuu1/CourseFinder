45919704~COURSE!~BwKNlSxKEei1rhIOBe4xWg,1640765141286,5,0,"PROS:1. This course is EXTREMELY aesthetically pleasing. The visuals, audio quality, and information organization are incredible. This course is light on lecturing, preferring to convey information instead with interactive graphs, which is helpful for complete newbies to Blockchain technology to conceptualize how each component within the blockchain works (also, each video is so pretty, you never want to turn away). Videos are short and to-the-point, readings are manageable, and the pacing is beginner-friendly (as in, you do not need prior knowledge of CS or of Blockchain).2. I have taken all the courses on Blockchain on Coursera. This is the only course that teaches you blockchain on a detailed level. Example: it teaches exactly how computation within Blockchain technology works, and thus why Crypto Mining takes such extensive resources. Other courses tend to give a more financial, birds-eye view of the entire process that explains the meat, but not the bones.3. It explains a lot of the 'Smart Apps' developmental process: such as, what apps developers use to test their smart apps before broadcasting it onto the blockchain, which websites developers gather, etc. This is VERY helpful if you are an aspiring Smart App Developer but do not know where to turn.CONS:1. The course is biased. Consensys is a Blockchain Software Development company that builds on Ethereum. Consensys high stakes both in Blockchain Development, and in Ethereum. Therefore, the entire course is highly pro-Blockchain and pro-Ethereum: it only touches twice, and both times very vaguely, on the drawbacks of the Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies in general. In terms of Blockchain technology, for example, they don't mention 51% attacks, or how the nature of decentralization can sometimes paradoxically lead back to centralization. (For a course that explains this, consider University of Michigan's Introduction to Bitcoin, also on Coursera.) In terms of Ethereum, they focus deeply on Ethereum as a technology, rather than as the digital speculative gold it is more often known for; so, if you wanted to learn about Crypto finance, this course is perhaps not for you.All in all, I highly enjoyed this course, and would definitely recommend anyone interesting in Blockchain technology to take it. However, note also keep in mind the potential biases.",0,1,Kristen Lee,45919704
