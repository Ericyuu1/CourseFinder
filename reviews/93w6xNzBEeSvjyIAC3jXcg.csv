It's an introductory course so not deep, but fun.A couple of things significantly detracted from the course for me. One was a feeling of unqualified evangelism. I think the microbiome is indeed a hugely important field, but the level of hype here, and lack of any critical perspective, was off-putting. This is particularly disturbing for products like probiotics, which have become a huge industry with little solid evidence to support them, or to choose between them. Also, they devote a lot of time to selling the American Gut Project. Which is a good cause, but I would rather they had spent that time teaching me something useful. I resent being duped into watching ads when I've signed up to be educated.The other thing that bothered me was the course required us to divulge a lot of personal information to other students in pointless, time-consuming projects.
