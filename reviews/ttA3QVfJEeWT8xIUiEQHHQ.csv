75034615~COURSE!~ttA3QVfJEeWT8xIUiEQHHQ,1609739486652,4,0,Over all a great intro or refresher. Could do with a more coverage of Infrastructure planning.

Much of which can be implemented at low cost in multiple provider types.  Doffing and Donning of high containment PPE videos were very informative.
