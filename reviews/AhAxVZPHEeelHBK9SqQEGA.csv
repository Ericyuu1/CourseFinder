8456518~COURSE!~AhAxVZPHEeelHBK9SqQEGA,1672162007427,2,0,"Pros: - It was useful to learn some keywords in data science. - helpful to play with basics of python.- helpful to see how python helps manage data.Cons: - it was distracting to see the lecturers in the video. It would have been helpful if they were just voice overs. It would have helped photographic memory if they replaced having themselves in the video with images of pathways, or even simple slides with words instead. - interviews with faculty members were interesting but were time-dependent. Meaning some of those projects are not longer operational due to lack of funding or other reasons. - The topics seemed disconnected and confusing. - the course objective was not unified and it seemed  disconnected themes wee merged into one course. One theme taught by each lecturer. ",0,1,Ghazaleh E,8456518

Coming from a DS background, I was expecting a deeper context on medical data. For instance, I would have preferred to have examples with actual medical data, rather than out-of-context examples (e.g. how to make a moussaka dish). I understand that this is so that everyone can follow but since the course is rated as ""intermediate"" rather than ""beginner"" I was expecting it to be totally referring to medical data. I also had an issue with the quizzes - in any browser I tried (IE, mozilla, Microsoft Edge) the radio-buttons were not aligned with the actual choices, there were a lot of empty lines in between. Thanks for the course. ",0,7,Anna Stavrianou,36556218
