29750655~COURSE!~CpOs5DyhEea_QBJ9iBnl3w,1566784782505,1,0,"This course is taught at a really low level. Exercises are in spreadsheets which are more or less useless for practicing scale data applications. Spreadsheets contain information that makes importation into numerical processing software such as Pandas in Python or dplyr in R needlessly difficult and assumes the user can't even apply the distance formula.Videos contain useful information but require wading through a lot of garbage at a slow pace, not useful for practitioners.Assignments are poorly worded and some terminology is used questionably or flexibly (see the word ""normalization""). Some assignments are so poorly done that there is an ongoing debate on the forums as to whether the autograder is messed up or the assignment instructions are messed up. The ""honors"" track programming assignments use some piece of software with questionable generalizability. If I ever see lens kit in my own data work environment I will come back an edit my review but I find it unlikely. Furthermore, Java is not commonly used for data science or machine learning purposes making these assignments inaccessible to many users. Personally, I write in Java but I didn't find it fulfilling to waste my time playing ""fill in the blanks"" or ""guess the library function"" which is overall uninstructive. Quiz assignments show true indications of the poor level of instruction. Recitation of pieces of information buried in 30 minutes videos that can be condensed into 5 are some of the finest examples of bad teaching. Regurgitating information found in required readings shows no level of comprehension of course material and is a severe disservice to students.I will hope for better general coverage of recommender systems in the future in another course. Ideally using something applicable like Python, Scala (Spark), or even R.",0,2,Alex Bruening,29750655

My feedback is that you could do more to tie the *implementation* to the theory and real-life applications you discuss. You have many great lectures talking about how these systems were implemented, qualitative differences, subtle differences, and interviewing people to give us perspectives. But then the videos on implementation (including working through the equations) are pretty sparse and short. I felt like I'm ""on my own"" to figure out how to go implement these in real life. The problem sets cover one test case, and that's it.  I think you could update the lectures to focus more on different algorithms / equations in different scenarios, rather than just talking qualitatively about them.  Regardless thank you!
