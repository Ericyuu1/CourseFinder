Some of the peer review prompts are placed as questions for the student, which causes confusion.The lecturers are very little personal. i.e I dont connect with them so I dont get too inspired and loose motivation with this particular course (not the subject). I feel a bit like in a sausage machine, yet there are not enough students on the course to review my assignments, or for me to review assignments. I keep on having to go back to,  a for me completed course, to see if there is anyone I can review to get my certificate. This goes for all of the courses in the series, regretfully.

Who is your audience?  How can you adapt the information to make it user-friendly and more digestible to your intended audience? What's the medium to be used to publish the report? What tools will you need beforehand to capture your story in the intended medium (print text, internet, video, audio)? Some things are obvious as we are all media consumers and can apply our own experiences but the assignments (though simplistic) when taken seriously, really help you to think and apply the concepts on your own.
