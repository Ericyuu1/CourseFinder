The instructor focuses heavily on explaining stuff rather than how to do stuff. Furthermore, course title says ""The arduino platform and C programming"" but actually the course gives no sufficient attention to C nor arduino itself. Instead, it focused heavily on concepts that are not at all important to a programmer learning arduino and embedded systems in general such as UART, how data is sent serially and the steps towards creation of a hex file.

I'm not sure that non-technical people would get much out of the lectures. On the other hand, the lectures were mostly at a superficial level, so I'm not sure that technical people would get much out of them either. The only topic that got a (somewhat) deep dive was serial communication, and it wasn't clear why; users of the Arduino don't need to understand it any more or less than any other aspect of how an Arduino works.There were other issues. The programs we wrote had to be pasted into a submission form that removed all the carriage returns when you hit Save; I had to manually fix my program each time. Perhaps most frustratingly, you could follow the assignment instructions to the letter, but after you submitted you might find out that the grading criteria included other requirements. In one case people asked about it, and it turned out that the grading criteria were wrong, but they were never updated. My sense was that not much effort went into the creation of this course.

10745356~COURSE!~gh5rVEd3EeW2ZBIIl17oPw,1474171464310,5,0,GOOD place to  start THe arduino intro is good  but little  short on c but its only 4 weeks not enough for me to grasp right off the bat anyway so i back off to next session  then catch up more C then finish its only a couple short c videos then your asked to  write programs with little or no knowledge basicly 3- 7 min lectures on the language EASY TO BE KINDA LOST AT FIRST IM 60 yrs old not twenty   !!! From what im reading online LIBRARIES ARE TOTALLY LIMITED ON ARDUINOS IDE nd ITS  NOT  REALLY  C its ARDUINO C   because a lot of the workings of the arduino ide are easier for new people alot of the inner workings are hidden tough to learn the inner workings unlike a full featured IDE GOOD Platform to start on  AFTER BASICS HERE  with tidbits  Id rather go later to C++  and spend the time there then get on  better platform ARM  PIC boards with real ides and REAL C + something you can use  in the real world for bigger programs and I can see staying here at arduino too long and not going on to other platforms could cause bad programing habits to start with writing limited code just seems more productive after you get your electronics down coding and some hardwhare experience to go right to the real deal Pic arm or any of the other boards with a MUCH steeper learning curve GREAT to Figure out and learn electronics get some hardwhare experience here of course on ARDUINO and from what im seeing from some pros Even if there on more advanced platforms that run bigger faster programs dont have  the bootloader many pros use arduino for a first layout to test circuits  here first GOOD COURSE gets you DIGGING  AND THINKING   This is where to start you certainly cant start on advanced platforms right off its really almost impossible without a lot more skill   to obtain first   ,0,5,craig calabrese,10745356
