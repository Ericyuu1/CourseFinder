However, some of the concepts were very complex and were taught without any background which make it difficult for students from other backgrounds, such as mechanical engineering, difficult to understand. Also, another issue was the linking of previous lecture to the next. The lecture videos did not tell much at the start specifically which previous concept was being explained or extended.
