6294332~COURSE!~MVZ09jVhEemVlQ65Erh-fA,1655923609577,4,0,"I suppose I take issue with the quizzes and the use of Cloud 9.  Although passable by doing research outside the class materials, many of the quiz questions ask the students to apply knowledge never explicitly mentioned in the lectures.  For example, the code for accomplishing the heapify down algorithm was shown, but the heapify down algorithm was never explicity defined.  Instead, a brief story suggesting how it generally works is provided.  If the vision for this course is to provide some perspective on a data structures course that was previously taken, or a unique take on data structures to supplement the student's prior knowledge, so be it.  I can recommend the ""Ordered Data Structures"" course as an orientation to much of the important information in the field, but that's the best I can do.  It would be best to clearly orient the student at the beginning of the class, mentioning that it will require outside knowledge not provided here.Although Cloud 9 is described as optional, it's really mandatory to complete the coding challenges, and it would be fair play to simply say so.  The make file provided to prepare the assignment for submission is tailored specifically to Cloud 9, and NOT to use Cloud 9 for the assignments would require the student to understand the complex requirements (never described in any detail) for preparing the code for the testing algorithm, and write a really complex make file.  Just say, ""Use Cloud 9"", and save the student the uncertainty and time wasted trying to cobble together a solution on VisualStudio or whatever. I have many positive comments.  I feel that the professor knows his stuff, and great care was taken to prepare the lectures and assignments to get students to engage meaningfully with data structures covered here.  I had to work harder than someone who'd just finished a ""Data Structures and Algorithms"" course -- and that's fine, because I needed to do the work!

The second half of the course, particularly the lectures on B-trees and heaps,  were somewhat lacking. Previous lectures included  many formal definitions in the slides, with clear examples and implementations in code. The lectures in the second two weeks contained less slides, and less precise definitions/explanations. Time-complexity explanations in particular were breezed over, and I felt like more time could be dedicated to formally determining the algorithmic run times in the examples. Ultimately, I was left wanting more depth, something which I had not felt in the lectures leading up to these last two weeks.
