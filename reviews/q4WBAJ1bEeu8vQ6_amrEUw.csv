Professors Raj and Deepak did a very good job oe explaining key concepts, then backing them up with real-world examples.  Made the concepts in the course very clear.  This course shed a lot of light on hoe disruptive models come about, how a disruptive business model can usurp existing models and how to deal with it if you are an ""existing model"".
