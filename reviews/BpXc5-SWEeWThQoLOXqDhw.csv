Also about the material, I expected some updating beyond 2015, this is a fast moving area. Even some references about the coolest new methods would have been nice, for people who need some extra.Also this course is for people who already have a solid background in networking and network modelling including mathematical backround in probability assessment.To summarize a good academic course with interesting material on a fast moving area.",0,0,Zipi Shaqed,3411926
