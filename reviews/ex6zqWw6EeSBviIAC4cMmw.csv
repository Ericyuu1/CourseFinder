However not many people enrolled at the time makes difficult for getting assignments graded on time and you are at the mercy of other students hopefully reviewing multiple students to hopefully review your classwork. May require multiple attempts at different class sessions to be able to get all assignment graded and earn certificate. As I struggled to get my assignments graded by others, I reviewed other students assignments I noticed many students on the same predicament. ",0,0,Angelica M Smith,24288539

Despite the fact that the course was developed in a nursing school, it is extremely useful for doctors. The course covers issues of quality of care, systems thinking, process approach and project development. In order to successfully complete the course, you need to achieve 32 deadlines in 6 weeks! The course is an excellent addition to the  ""Patient Safety"" specialization from the Johns Hopkins University. Thanks to the developers!",0,1,Simonov Oleg,23570468
