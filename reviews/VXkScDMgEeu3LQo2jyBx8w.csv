266153~COURSE!~VXkScDMgEeu3LQo2jyBx8w,1667709435334,1,0,"Lectures are terrible: no real explanation of what is going on, just definition of terms. Some links to reference material are broken. Presenter's voice is not very clear: speaks in low vocal fry (i.e. mostly whispered). Example code in labs have minimal explanation. The examples are not explained in lectures. This is stuff we'd expect just from a brief Google search. ",0,0,David Chin,266153

Instead of working on the concepts, I had to work on how to run files in the assignment. The theory and explanations provided is also not adequate. ",0,0,Shovan Raj Shrestha,23105791

Would give 5 stars, but I​ think it's missing a bit of a polish, some exercises are not as clearly stated as they could be, and there are links to additional resources that are still broken. I think it is still worth doing the course despite all this, but I would like to see the course administration improve these things. ",0,0,Shashvat Shukla,10274185

It's ok, but if you are familiar with these concepts you could skip this courseLabs sometimes have some little bugs, but could be resolved easily based on hints from corresponding discussion section",0,0,Alexander Efitorov,123672756
