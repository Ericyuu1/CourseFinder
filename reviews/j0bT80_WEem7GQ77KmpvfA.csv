10851410~COURSE!~j0bT80_WEem7GQ77KmpvfA,1594942379722,3,0,"The most interesting part of this course was the history of the Tango. It does a decent job in describing the musical aspect of it, although the dance and lyrics (poetry) could have been a little deeper. Someone should do a revision of the text and translation of the videos since it has many mistakes.  The professor tries to do her best to pronounce the words in Spanish but the text (captions) doesn't help clarify when in doubt. Great resources too!",0,0,Armando Mazariegos,10851410

3547783~COURSE!~j0bT80_WEem7GQ77KmpvfA,1638494370413,4,0,"Very good overview with enough information who want to learn more about tango. What I did not like was separate pages for music and text. So for example, when you come across the multitude of unknown names you have to try and remember whether you heard them on Spotify. That's too complicated. In addition for me it meant having to install Spotify which I will probably never use again, but it will have my name and email and continue to plague me forever.  The names would be easier to remember if one could immediately see the person on a video or hear them in an audio link.",0,0,Zlatica S Hoke,3547783

I found the quizzes sometimes 'wrong' where the text of the course says one thing and but the correct answer to the question expected something different.  This happened only a few times and wasn't a showstopper.
