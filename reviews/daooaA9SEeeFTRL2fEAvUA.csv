Some of the links to the readings do not work and need to be updated. The peer review process can be frustrating: some peer reviewers need training in marking papers based on the rubric. Discussion forum should be monitored; inane posts that do not add value to students' learning should be deleted. Overall, I would recommend the course. ",0,1,Jun Maranan,52218769

42738612~COURSE!~daooaA9SEeeFTRL2fEAvUA,1563670370983,5,0,This online course gave me adequate insight into the importance of data collection and usage of it by different health care professionals to transform into better patient care. Very nice illustration on terminologies used for data retrieval and data analytics a must-attend course for all those professionals who are keen to make an impact on patient-centred care.  I am glad that I did this course at the right time when our hospitals are changing into electronic medical records. It also emphasizes the importance of understanding data errors and how it affects patient management. The clear message from this course is every individual working in hospital settings has a role to play in the data integrity. Highly recommended course. Thoroughly enjoyed it. ,0,0,Meena Rani Sumathy Kutty Amma,42738612
