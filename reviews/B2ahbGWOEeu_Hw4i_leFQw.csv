85917339~COURSE!~B2ahbGWOEeu_Hw4i_leFQw,1622770034763,1,0,"T​his was unacceptable as a course on BLM. For this to have been of any value at all, we needed guided discussion. The course amounts to 45 minutes of google searches and reading. The quizzes were a joke- one answer was ""Right"" and also ""False"" in a true/false setting. I'm embarrased that this course has the name of my institution on it. I'm glad to have done the additional reading, but wow, this needs to be reworked completely. Maybe it lacked funding? If so, this vitally important content should be well-funded by JHU. But as it stands, I can't believe what I just experienced.",0,8,Max Zinkus,85917339
89386697~COURSE!~B2ahbGWOEeu_Hw4i_leFQw,1635383648476,2,0,"T​his course was okay, but was lacking substantive content. The cited sources were usually of poor quality, i.e., the popular media. This is disappointing, because there are free, high-quality sources on this subject, e.g., reports by Amnesty International and the UN.",0,5,Thomas Bewick,89386697
15513862~COURSE!~B2ahbGWOEeu_Hw4i_leFQw,1632072925146,2,0,"Not bad subject material or introduction, but superficial and not much content other than a collection of readings.  Also some broken links, a few issues w/ perspective/bias as opposed to objective&analytical examination, and the discussion sections are not conducive to actual discussion (adding a peer review feature could help) or deeper examination.  As is, I wouldn't be able to justify paying for it.  ",0,7,Andy Towarnicky,15513862
89618219~COURSE!~B2ahbGWOEeu_Hw4i_leFQw,1626891613589,2,0,"The course is shallow, becoming borderline insulting in its shallowness from time to time. The structure of the quiz gave the sense that questions had been thrown together. I would point learners to other resources such as the excellent Crash Course on the history of race in the US, which is available for free on YouTube. I would not recommend this course.",0,7,Ramon Arjona,89618219
