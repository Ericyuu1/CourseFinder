I think the course is quite interesting and informative and I plan to take more of your courses; but you should be very concerned about the Coursera Platform that it is presented on. I have spent hours and hours trying to navigate within it. I watch the videos and this is apparently not recorded. Then I watch them again to see if the fact that I watched them shows up. The layout of the page is scattered; its use being indecipherable. The platform is a disaster. An institution of higher learning should take exception to the total lack of logical layout or (let's say intuitiveness) of what Coursera presents here.

I did not learn a great deal that was new, and certainly nothing in any great depth. If you have been keeping up with popular accounts of science in newspapers, magazines, or on the web, you probably are familiar with all the scientific concepts that the course presents. And the framing of those concepts in the course simply bothered me. The instructors can't help mixing notions of purpose and intent into science, as if that is necessary to experience what they value so highly: wonder. In fact, you can understand, wonder at, and value life without bringing in teleology. Sometimes looking for purpose distracts you from beauty. I would advise potential students that their time would be better spent taking a more traditional natural science course. Have patience. Study deeply. You will find beauty there.

The topic, most of the readings, and about half the videos, are captivating and exciting and world-view changing. But the material (internal readings followed by video lectures followed by video interviews followed by video excerpts from a documentary followed by external readings, etc.) do not, in my opinion, compliment or add to each other so much as simply keep repeating the same thing in multiple medias. So, in this way, the course somehow achieved to be both thrilling and dull at the same time. However, the course is well worth it if you are interested in big ideas like deep history, human capacity for story-making, meaning-making, and mythology, and the human spirit. Despite the title, these are the big themes, while actual cosmology or astronomy are secondary (though important).
