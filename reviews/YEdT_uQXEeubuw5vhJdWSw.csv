The instructor does an amazing job to explain concepts in the simplest possible way without sacrificing necessary details. This is a theory based course and there are no programming assignments, but the quizes test that you understand the principles. No slides available at this time so you will have to take your own notes.",0,0,Marco Morais,3147521
