31879233~COURSE!~2iwzNFxUEeuaew6diVe1Ww,1655714171885,4,0,"Very good course. But some of the excercises are confusing, such as the one with textfile in reverse. It should have specified that only the lines were supposed to be reversed. I assumed the whole text should be reversed. Also, sometimes the auto correction is a bit ridiculous, such as evaluating the whole programming excercise as wrong for missing a dot at the end of a sentence on print. That said, this course is quite superb otherwise, do not let the codio hickups scare You, don't give up.",0,0,Lars Tuff,31879233
