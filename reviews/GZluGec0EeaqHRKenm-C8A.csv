Quiz's are set for the student to fail.  When I compare course 1 and course 2 to course 3, I am not learning anything.

24641762~COURSE!~GZluGec0EeaqHRKenm-C8A,1539055713076,1,0,"It wasn't a great eperience to do this course. First of all, I didn't get graded of my assignments on time---course was closed but grades of more than half of my assignments were still open. It wasn't only me, but all my classmates. Without the grading and comments, we don't know if we did the assignments right, and where we can improve. Second, I had two assignments which were were graded below 60%. The comment to the first one was I didn't reply to at least two of my classmates. But that was an individual project assignment and we were graded by the course team, and we can't see others' submissions. It's not fair that I was graded 50% for that submission. For the second one, the comments were the review criteria as if I didn't follow the criteria. But I did follow. There was no valuable comment towards the content of my assignment itself which is very irresponsible! Third, the live session. It happened on Friday and due to the time zone issue, I couldn't attend. But the recording was uploaded too late. Sunday is normally the deadline for assignment submission and we don't need last minute tuition. If it was for tutoring us through the course, then it should have been arranged before Wednesday and the recording should be uploaded the same day as the live session took place so we had enough time to use it as guidance under the circumstance that we didn't have enough tuition. We paid heaps of money to do this course and we deserve better tuition and service! ",0,1,Ninon Zhou,24641762

28382601~COURSE!~GZluGec0EeaqHRKenm-C8A,1571668146114,3,0,Content and exercises are very good indeed! I learned a lot! The presenter in the video lecture has nice examples and analogies but talks quite fast. The discussion forum was not very helpful but the instructor responded promptly to email queries. Although I earned an 'A' I found the material more challenging than the previous courses. The level of jargon and abbreviations keeps increasing. Perhaps good to get used to? ;),0,0,Jan Rhebergen,28382601

Lots of jumping around on topics with disconnects to what was being taught, and what was being asked. Still have no idea why there was a Milestones activity mid-class. Grading was way behind for this round. As of the end of class, i still had ungraded assignments from week one and not a single week was closed out. I believe there were 10 out of 22 assignments graded, of which 6 were quizzes which are graded once submitted. It's a little silly that only four or so assignments were graded by the end of class. I assume i passed the class! Despite this, i didn't want to penalize the score i gave as this may have been a one-off and as mentioned, the material is useful.  ",0,0,Timothy Carter,33169064

Peter sincerely cares about our learning. He combines the real world PM wisdom with PMI recommendations to guide us through a wide variety of important topics. I particularly enjoyed the weekly live sessions where we can discuss any project management related issues with Peter. In addition to project management, Peter taught us how to communicate well with a touch of humor, and how to lead effectively.
