The style class, the plot class and the setting class all had detailed, concrete teachings, whereas these lectures were too airy. Most of them consisted of authors chatting with each other. The assignments required real craft however, and it would have been helpful to LEARN those skills in the modules. For example, one assignment asked us to describe a character in a setting, while they were not actually there - say a divorced nurse in a hospital. Not once in the lectures were we ever taught HOW to do this. We watched a series of author fireside chats, and then people bumbled through the assignment. I really wanted Amy Bloom to just walk over to the board and draw a character and say ""this is a woman, she's divorced, she's middle class, she tends to get very angry when things don't go her way"" or whatever,and then draw out a list of how her internal states might manifest in the world around her - she throws things, she's disorganized, she writes mean notes in the patient charts. I wanted her to teach. She seems to think we already know how to do things like imply a characters state of mind through action. I mean, for a beginning writer, its helpful to just make a list of details about a character - where they're from, what they like or don't like, what sort of flaws they might have and so on.

I enjoyed the lectures and the interviews with authors and
found both helpful. Top marks for the quality of those elements. I discovered some
authors whose books are now on my reading list.
I would have appreciated more structure on the fundamentals,
perhaps with assigned readings and self-assessment exercises. 
The feedback that I received was less valuable than in other
writing courses I have taken. I, in turn, found that it was challenging to provide
helpful feedback. The skill level was quite uneven, and many were so poor in
the fundamentals that it was hard to know where to begin. Given that the
enrollment is large, could you do a real-time writing exercise at the beginning
to place learners in levels and tailor the teaching to their needs? Or,
could you suggest to students that they take advantage of software like
Grammarly? Is there a programme that is better suited to creative writing?
A technical point, I could not find a way to copy-paste the
submissions in a way that did not leave me with tedious re-formatting- and even
when it seemed correct, line breaks and indents would disappear, or get larger. I did wish I
could have uploaded rather than copy-paste the assignments. Perhaps I could
have and missed the instruction. The spacin gin this feedback is a good example of the problem- I have leftit uncorrected

the highlight. I hope my feedback will be helpful.

The explanations seemed vague at the very best. Secondly, about peer review. I reviewed over 30 assignments, and it is safe to conclude that many peers didn't understand the instructions or the grading rubric. For the former, one could say that the instructions were confusing and difficult to follow through for someone just starting off with creative writing. Moreover, many peers were just not interested in giving fruitful feedback and left words like ""good,"" ""."" and the like. So that didn't help much.

I felt like the other professors had great logical classes that broke down the technical side of things well, but Amy Bloom gave a wonderful insight into the ""out-of-the-box"" and emotional awakening of literature's people. If you don't understand the great works of L. M. Montgomery, C. S. Lewis, or other authors that could see things in an emotional, spiritual way, you may not understand Prof. Bloom.
