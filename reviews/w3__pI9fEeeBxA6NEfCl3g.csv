37653407~COURSE!~w3__pI9fEeeBxA6NEfCl3g,1647223838664,1,0,"This specialization should be called... `HOW DO I SEARCH FOR COMPONENTS FOR A DRONE ON THE INTERNET ´. You lose a lot of time searching for components for the drone, which could have been used for designing with Fusion 360. A waste of time in my opinion. If the assessment of the last assignment of each course takes at least one week, then this also means a significant financial loss for the student. Apparently the tutors from Autodesk don't take the evaluation of the course assignments very seriously, since about 80% of the submitted assignments by the fellow students are some crap. I could have saved myself a lot of time AND MONEY by also handing in csome rap to pass the course. Very frustrating...
Autodesk should revise the specialization and take assignment evaluation more seriously.",0,2,Jens Erdmann,37653407
90519468~COURSE!~w3__pI9fEeeBxA6NEfCl3g,1636546421310,1,0,"The course in and of itself is great. However, the review system is poorly structured. Forces you to wait to get your certificate even though you submit your work early. This isn't the main issue. My biggest concern is the amount of plagiarism in the assessment that have been handed in. Which is probably caused from the fact that there are NO CLEAR EXAMPLES TO MAKE THE CALCULATIONS REQUIRED FROM THE FINAL ASSESSMENTS. This is a course that is solely dedicated to drones. Whereas the title implies a generality that just isn't there. Appalled by these obvious flaws which nobody seem concerned about.",0,2,Michele Pescatori De Luca,90519468

The drone did serve as a good practice project, but the emphasis was on educated parts shopping, especially in the first week and the final assignment's design criteria.While valuable skills were taught - such as writing and understanding design criteria, making good design choices as informed by available pre-made components, ensuring both their function and compatibility, and accommodating their physical dimensions while proceeding with drafting a model - they would be better fit into a course named for drone design or electronics design, specifically.Learners following the 5 course F360 specialization, hoping to improve their savvy in the software, may find 2 out of 4 weeks of this syllabus to be a slog.",0,3,Jon White,17739985

Originally, I felt like the final project was a bit out in the weeds, with its emphasis on components and design criteria considering a drone.  After giving my stance some thought, I believe the real point of the final project is to showcase the flexibility of Fusion 360 to make the design and engineering process parallel processes vs. linear processes.A word to future students:  Please be ready to spend some meaningful time on the final project.  I reviewed many submissions whose authors obviously didn't read the criteria, or didn't care to put in the work.  To perform even minimally well, this isn't necessarily an easy course.  You need to do your research when it comes to components, and you need to be ready to run the numbers (especially when it comes to battery selection).  Lastly, don't sell yourself short, and don't give into peer pressure to give full marks to someone who didn't even do the work.  But in the same breath, be sure to pay enough attention when you review peers to properly evaluate their work (I had someone comment that they wanted more info regarding thrust to current draw for a motor, when I linked to a graph that literally was thrust vs. current draw!  Clearly they out as much effort into reviewing my project as they put into theirs!)  Help maintain the integrity of the courses.  I really believe this is a good way to skill up and explore now knowledge, and even find a new career path.  Good luck, and be well!",0,0,David Melsheimer,52170723
