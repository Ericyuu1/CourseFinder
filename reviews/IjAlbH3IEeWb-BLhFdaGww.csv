It would be nice to see some examples with real number in the powerpoints. The quizzes are too strict to get the correct answer. +/- .1% tolerance is such a small margin. Also, the way the equations are typed in can easily be entered wrong. I got answers correct in some of the quizzes that I failed then got it wrong in the next attempt. I​ don't like that I can't even tell if i'm close to the correct answer. This course was very frustrating. I don't know if this is a University of Colorado issue or a Coursera issue. This was my first Coursera course. I will try the next Power Electronics course but may drop it if it is the same experience.Also, there is absolutely no feedback except for the students, who seem to have the same struggles as me.

100337802~COURSE!~IjAlbH3IEeWb-BLhFdaGww,1657416301447,1,0,"Bob, the professor, suffers from what I call the Merle Potter Syndrome. If you don't know who Potter is, he was a published mechanical engineer professor whose books are poorly written. One can easily tell that Potter knew the material, but could not communicate the subject matter. Bob is identical in both aspects - knows the material, can't communicate.  Prior to taking this course, I spent two months reading his text book in anticipation for class. Sadly, the recorded lectures provide little to no help or guidance for answering the homework. The recorded content is barely even addressed in the homework. In fact the homework is the teacher. Which, when the homework becomes the teacher, what is the point in having a talking head at that point? Additionally, much like his lectures, Bob's textbook is written in the same fashion.  Currently, I've had to seek out a professor from another university graduate program, unrelated to University of Colorado, to learn this material. And I received help from Texas Instruments. I will complete this class, but in terms of completing this specialization, I will more than likely not complete it. Instead opting to start another specialization with the university. If it is found that other professors ""teach"" in the same fashion as Bob, then I will find a new university altogether.  In the end, if you are a professional who designs power electronics for a living and is looking to earn a master's degree in EE, then skip the recorded lectures, answer the homework, and take the final exam. If Power Electronics is new to you, I would strongly implore you to find another program. Or do what I'm doing seek out external help and just go through the motions of this class.

With no book for this course, this leaves the students with a lot of guess work to do and external learning in order to understand the homework problems. Therefore, defeating the purpose of this course. In addition, I struggled immensely with week 2 homework because although my answers were 100% correct, if I did not enter my derived formula in the exact form of the answer, it would mark it as wrong. I discovered this by rearranging the variables in my answers until the program acknowledged them as correct. For example, one of the answers in the homework was D*Vg.

17997926~COURSE!~IjAlbH3IEeWb-BLhFdaGww,1603304751263,5,0,"Very clear and concise explanations about basic analysis methods for power electronic circuits. What's great is the emphasis on general methodologies - you are not expeted to memorize the operation of all different power electronics circuits but are rather taught generally applicable tools to analyse any power electronic circuits you are given. I have taken this course as a refresher as I previously have a Master's in power electronics but have been working in other industries for the past 5 years. Thus, I think I can confidently say that the coverage in this course is good and the lectures and exercises have clearly been carefully constructed. My only minor negative point is that the exercises, while generally very good for making the student apply the skills taught in the course, are a little bit unforgiving in the sense that if you have somewhere along the way made a mistake when deriving analytical expressions, it might be quite difficult and time-consuming to find the error as it is difficult to get hints or to get pointed in the right direction. Of course, that might be expected from an online course and I guess there is also a (more expensive) version of this course available where you also have access to course staff which would certainly help when running into such issues. It's quite a time-consuming course so be prepared, I spent much more than the quoted 3h per exercise (without counting the first exercise which was pretty straightforward).",0,1,Tommi Jokela,17997926

The lecturer was easy to follow, except during certain topics. That, however, is more due to the difficult nature of the subject than a fault of the professor. I found myself pausing and rewatching some portions so I could gain a better understanding but I don't have any problems with that. There is a good balance between more generalized overviews of key circuit concepts and more detailed analyses of specific circuit topologies. You may have to do some outside research to fully understand all details and I know some people may be turned off by that. I believe it is fine, and it is a good way to learn how to find information on your own. I did not have to do this more than a few times (that would actually be annoying). Lastly, the assignments were just challenging enough to force me to actually grasp the material, without making it seem like it was impossible to complete.",0,4,Beili Liu,75912
