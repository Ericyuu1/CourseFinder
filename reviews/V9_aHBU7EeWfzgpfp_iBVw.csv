This was a huge work and professor Randal must have a challenging task in putting all this work together.

The few segments where he broke away and described  net-neutrality as an economic device was perfect in that structure, but if that could be applied (with some of the hypo examples he used) in those other terminology areas, I would not be saying law outweighed economics.  I must admit I only come from reading economic books by physical Economists (never took principles) so I may not see things the way he does, but I just want to make clear that someone like me welcomes Economic charts, graphs, empirical testing with defining that field's jargon.

nostalgic, one of its kind, and thus very valuable. The curriculum is very well
designed. I like how he frames each week’s topic. It's a shame that the course was produced in 2015 and since then many things happened in the tech world - it would be just awesome to hear Randy’s comments on and

As an economist and practitioner of competition policy I found most of the examples very useful to understand the reasoning of judges (if that would be possible). The discussion on copyrights and competition are of most use to understand the limits of both, since very often arguments on copyright come to place in competition cases in this kind of industries. However, maybe the best of the course is how Professor Picker is able to mix and mach history with current events. The notion that technological development is not something new and that many of the discussions we have today had been taken before is very important in order not to lose ground in the analysis.
