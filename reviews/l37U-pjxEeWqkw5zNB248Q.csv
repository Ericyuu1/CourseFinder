Holocaust is the most horrific event in the History of Humankind. The Holocaust
was a crime against humanity. The biggest ever. Everybody should denounce it. I
wish everybody would do this course. I have read a lot about the Holocaust and
I still wonder: how is possible that the Holocaust happened? My view about both
the humankind and ""God"" (between brackets because I do not believe in
God -God died in Auschwitz) is absolutely pessimistic. Why? Because of the
Holocaust. Thank you so much for this amazign and interesting course. Let's
