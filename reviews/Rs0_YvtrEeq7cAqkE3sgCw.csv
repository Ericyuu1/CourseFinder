Clear, precise & to the point.2. The hands-on workshops are good & provide you with good hands-on experience.Now for the Cons :1. I find it quite difficult to listen to instructor Jonathan Dion because of his very exaggerated mimics, voice tone, hands movement & accent. It feels more like an acting class rather than a Python\AWS course.2.I'm currently in Week 3 of the course but I have to say that there's hardly any python here. It mainly focuses on the serverless AWS services ( which is good ) but the 'python' part is scarce.3. The QUIZ in each week\section has questions that were NOT taught anywhere in the course.Now regarding Coursera itself :1. Unlike most  other Online Course providers Coursera charges you Per month. Not per course.  So it's like a subscription. You would have assumed that it's a monthly fee for any course you wish to take but it's only for the course you're taking ! you want to take another course ? Pay additional fee....each month.... I personally think that's outrageous.2. To top that the good folks from Coursera do not provide an invoice when they charge. Only a receipt. Why ? that's their policy.....I hope Coursera will indeed PUBLISH my review. I think they need this kind of feedback.....Uri PessachIT Manager 1beat.com",0,1,Uri Pessach,91468972
