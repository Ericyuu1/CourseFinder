102420850~COURSE!~xNL0TVkTEei-TBLgOSj5Og,1659886916863,1,0,"This was a terribly underwhelming experience. This course is supposed to be for beginners, but if you're new to 3D modeling, you'll be having a really hard time (like I did). Not to mention the quality of the lessons themselves! The videos are extremely difficult to follow, they assume you already know what they are talking about and they move quickly through the software features without explaining what they're doing. The quality of the videos is also terrible, even at its highest setting the audio is muffled and the image is always a little blurred, which is something that won't help when you're already struggling to understand the lesson on a software you don't know, and you can also clearly see from the montage that these videos are excerpts from longer and more detailed lessons, that's why they're so confusing. That's why I felt the need to integrate with (very well done) YouTube tutorials, while paying my hard earned money for this course. Another lack of this course is the fact that is focused on a specific software (MayaLT/Maya), which is very expensive to buy, if you want to keep on using it. This is not the main issue I had with the software tho, you must know beforehand (but it's something that is not mentioned anywhere) that this specific software conflicts with AMD processors. Nice uh? I discovered it after almost a month of struggle, searching for an answer in forums around the web. So if you happen to have and AMD processor (which is actually not so uncommon), I whish to advise you to not take this course in the first place, because some important features of the software (like unwrapping, if you're familiar with 3D modeling) won't work at all, and you won't be able to complete your assignments!I've tried for a while to use Blender instead, to try to  complete the assignments and finish the course. Blender is a very good software, widley used professionally and most of all totally free! And there are lots of free detailed courses on YouTube, but of course is not exactly the same as Maya, so I struggled a lot every week learning a new software to do assignments for lessons explained this poorly. And you know what? I decided it's not worth it. This course is not worth my money or my time. ",0,0,Greta Ricciolini,102420850
11368301~COURSE!~xNL0TVkTEei-TBLgOSj5Og,1608523788685,2,0,"The course is mediocre at best.It gives you the overall idea of the procedure - 3D editor, UV-map, textures, import to Unity - but it's so high-level and lacking details, it's absolutely impractical. Introduction to software used in the course is not nearly enough. I was using Blender (instead of Maya used in the course) and if I didn't have past experience with 3D modelling, I would have a very hard time with it.The other issue is that there's plenty of information available elsewhere which is both more in-depth and better presented, which makes this material redundant.This course is for no one - basically if you are a complete beginner, it would be too hard and too demanding with little to no guidance and if you are already familiar with 3D modelling, then this course will not add anything to your skillset.  Personally, I feel that I've learned nothing from this course, if not for some extra practice.I would like to specifically comment on the peer reviews section - it's absolutely ludicrous that course is being graded solely by other pupils! 90% of works in the course are either a copycat of mentor's work or just outright plagiarized. It was very sad reviewing such material. I repeat, YOUR REVIEW IS DONE BY STUDENTS ONLY.And to add to insult, I've waited 2.5 weeks for my final assignment to be checked by someone since there's no one around!",0,11,Dmitrii,11368301

So i had to google instructions how to import animation to Unity. and  found out that a very important part (baking) had been missed in videos.
