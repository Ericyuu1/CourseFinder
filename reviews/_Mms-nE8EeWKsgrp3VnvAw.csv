Those lecturers are experts in the HR field, their lectures are clear and helpful. It is such a pleasure to learn from their lectures.The reason why I give a one-star rate is I believe Coursera's ""peer review"" assignment procedure is really problematic. ""Discussion section"" is supposed to be a place that all student share their ideas and experiences, however, it is filled with ""Please review my assignment and I will review back with the highest marks"" now. I totally understand why this happened now, due to the ""peer review"" procedure.For me, I have an assignment requires a minimum of 80% to pass the whole specialization. My first attempt got 77% and I thought ""Sure, there is definitely some improvement I can make"". My second attempt got 79% and guess what? I canceled the subscription and find a real book and some videos from youtube. I believe I can learn from CPHR's NKE materials as well.

The questions are literally trying to test the recency of you watching the video. There is a question which asks you to choose the right percentage of something from four options! It is not even a fact that is worth to remember! Many other questions are simply true/false questions, which does not require you to apply what you learned from the lecture but rather remember what you have watched. Even for the lecture itself, the lecturer gave absolute statements without qualifying it or combining it with sufficient contexts, which is off-putting. For instance, one of her opinions is, ""whenever you can, hire internally"". She gave reasons such as boosting morale, less hiring costs etc. These are true reasons but ""whenever you can"" gives the absoluteness and it is ambiguous (how do you define can/cannot?)I feel pretty upset after going thru the first two weeks of content and just don't want to waste my time any more.

The quality of the videos was poor, with the introductions being almost impossible to hear and then the following fragment very loud. The videos were interrupted at weird places, in the middle of a sentence for example, for in-video quizzes and there were other unfinished sentences and lost of long breaks. The instructor spoke in a monotonous voice and didn't use many tools to make it more interesting. I found it difficult not to get distracted - the total opposite of the Preparing to Manage Human Resources course.

The quizzes included many questions that weren't discussed in the videos, or sometimes even marked answers as wrong while the video clearly said it was the right answer. Also, in case of a wrong answer, it didn't say afterwards which should've been the right answer, just that it was wrong. How are you supposed to learn from you mistakes this way?

The course gave some suggested reading, however it only gave a link to the homepage of a website. It would've been helpful to get suggestions on interesting articles or pages on the website, or at least mention why this website is relevant.
One of the videos included a link to a YouTube video, which was an interesting video but the course said it would only take 10 minutes while the video lasts over an hour.

Finally, I'd suggest to get a quality check on peer review assignments. I spent quite some time on my assignment and on reviewing others, including constructive feedback even in cases where I thought the quality of the work was poor. In most cases I just received a grade back from other peers, or in the best case a rushed comment saying 'great work'.

The first thing I want to note is that it does not concern Specialization in general, because the first course with Professor Budd was fascinating and easy for me.

But even if I completely copy the original text from the subtitles and paste it as an answer, it is still marked as incorrect! Further, this is a grading system for the final exam, which is held every week. So, I found questions in it that I didn’t remember, because a nice woman lecturer speaks very interestingly about general concepts that are already clear, and the listener does not go into details when trying to understand the essence, but the question may include an answer which is not even one of the key ideas of the course. Instead, the answer to the question can be just a word hidden in the middle of a sentence, the mention of which does not carry any information at all, but for some reason is inserted into the question! Well, and finally, if the test is done incorrectly, it is impossible to see exactly where you made a mistake, if the question includes the choice of several options: maybe I made a mistake only 1 time or all 2 times, how should I understand what my mistake is?
