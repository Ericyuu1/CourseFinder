I came into this course after taking an introductory SAS programming course, and, at times, I felt underprepared on that front. I wish I had more experience with SAS coding and the SAS software before I began this course. However, my knowledge of statistics and ability to pick up statistical concepts got me through the tougher parts of this course.
