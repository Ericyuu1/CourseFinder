30934220~COURSE!~n9z0CNCvEeWoww7Hc7148Q,1518228462927,3,0,The material was insightful and useful.  Unfortunately it mainly covers the route for the Barcelona World Race and I was ultimately more interested in the weather patterns for the North Pacific.  I think the overview of the weather (first sections) with the latter sections chockfull of examples were great and I better understand the weather systems in sailing terms on a broad base.

80177845~COURSE!~n9z0CNCvEeWoww7Hc7148Q,1612621165399,4,0,"The overall structure and compilation of the course is good and fun to learn. Quizzes are good and at a fairly well-defined level. Everything is logically building up from the basics.  A good portion of the course is in Spanish (lectures), with different teachers involved. But transcription texts are good with just some minor translation flaws, example: ""tiempo"" can be translated to ""time"", but also ""wheather"", sometimes, this is wrong. In my case, none of these flaws have had an effect on passing the exam quizzes. There are some inconsistencies in the vocabulary due to the various teachers involved using both, English and Spanish, and also due to personal preferences in the graphic illustration of wheather fronts, etc. For some beginning the course with zero prior knowledge, this might be confusing - however, it might also be a plus for those who can handle it and get to know two systems without getting lost in translation.The projection in videos sometimes lack contrast, so some of the details (maps) are not clearly visible.",0,0,Johannes Alisch,80177845
