1340704~COURSE!~9hnW2R72Ee2yZg5tMRE6IQ,1667939817277,4,0,"Professor Wright gave perhaps the bests course I have taken ""An Introduction to Classical Music.""  In this course He again demonstrates that he is an expert teacher.  He present logically and well.And he keeps our interest by interspersing slides, anecdotes and interviews. And he has done a lot of research on the subject.so it was fun and I learned stuff.But I did have trouble with it. First I did not agree with the definition of genius -- I think it does not have to be a mental.  Perhaps he has a very broad idea of ""mental"", but I have seen many innovative adjustments in various sports, for example, that seem similar to me to some of the examples he uses. From that start he is pretty consistent. so if you accept that, you can enjoy the course (which I did).I have a scientific background, so I do not know how he selected his geniuses -- who and how many he may have left out -- who may have altered some of his conclusions (He did present this with regard to mental disorders.)I thought the course drifted from the nature of genius to the habits (not hidden -- they were well known -- maybe they were ""fun facts"") of some of them to brief biographies in Week 3. He wrapped this up well in the last section of Week 4, with a typical American focus on money. (that was also an American diversion -- geniuses and wealth -- which really had nothing to do with the ""nature of genius, but were fun facts about some of them.I hope this is seen as ""constructive -- I did enjoy the course and I did learn somethings about myself from it as well.",0,0,Stephen Corber,1340704
