77959658~COURSE!~YReFaj2LEeiTjQ4kFvy-Pg,1642480737937,3,0,I am not able to understand why the certificate mentions it as a non-credit course.

119802194~COURSE!~YReFaj2LEeiTjQ4kFvy-Pg,1672019087810,4,0,"Well. It is an introductory course to DFT theory without any actual practice on real DFT codes. The course is really short and they only give a very brief overview of things. There are so many moments that they touched some deeper concepts but quickly changed topic. So, for someone who really wants to learn DFT (theory or practical) this is probably not very useful.I am still giving it 4 stars for the course does have some good content despite the flaws.",0,0,HexagonReversal,119802194

The lecturers have made quite an effort to compress coherently and well a great deal of information into a three-week course. They teach with manifest interest to get the students engaged. I've taught one course once and know how hard it is to do it well. My only quibble is that the lecture notes could be more and better. Also, many of the reference papers are unavailable to those of us far from an academic environment. Here in the US it costs typically $35 to rent w/o copy a paper. To buy the paper is more money. If there ever was going to be a revised version of this course I would like to see lectures on QMC and extensions of DFT (time-dependence, magnetic properties of materials).
