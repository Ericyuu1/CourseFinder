31391706~COURSE!~5kZybGSlEeukqwqbfuJnYQ,1663284907229,2,0,"I​f you just want a very quick overview of what linux is and does, then this course may suffice. But something deeper and with a bit of effort, I would suggest you check out other courses. If you can take this course for free or you have a subscription, than sure, this course doesnt hurt to just get a quick summization. But that's about it. I just can't justify paying for this course. Most of the information is directed to wikipedia. The labs are just freestyle practice, like here is a shell, do what you want. The quizzes...that's whatever. The thing I liked most about this course, is probably the website that it links to, which shows the command lines you use in linux, but even that is limited because it is mainly just a copy of what you will find in the help or man pages, but formated better and with a extra explanation at the bottom. I really wanted to like this course because I can tell the creator does seem to know a lot about linux, but this falls short of anything valuable to me. There are even some misspellings throughout the course, which just tells you the kind of effort put into the course. The videos are just him reading the powerpoint like those teachers you find in school. Sometimes, he will give some input but not much. Again, if you have no idea what linux is or you used to know linux and forgot it, this course is a very quick overview that can maybe give you a bit of a jog in memory or foundation to learning linux. But if you know even the slighest bit about linux or you have even installed ubuntu on your system by yourself, I would suggest skippin this. ",0,1,Minh Wang,31391706

18102238~COURSE!~5kZybGSlEeukqwqbfuJnYQ,1662207802580,3,0,"A​s with course 1 and course 2 in this four-course series, the lectures and slides are useful in terms of introducing you to all the different components in a linux system. The lecturer just reads out the slides, and the extended reading is often just Wikipedia pages, not dedicated course materials. All of this is fine as long as you use the different headers and topics to continue and do your own research elsewhere.A​ weakness in the course are the labs. Each time, the assignment is just 'play with these commands' . I do like the demonstrations of the use of the commands, but it would be much more effective if those videos were the introduction to the lab, and that the lab presented learners with a real problem to solve using the newly learned commands in a virtual linux environment.",0,2,Timo Carlier,18102238
