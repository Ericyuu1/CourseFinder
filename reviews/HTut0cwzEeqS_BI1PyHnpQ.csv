There were powerful links to unfolding ecological moments in the news that happened during the course. I also appreciated the strong connection that climate justice is social justice. The end of the course in particular was attentive to the way race, gender, and class were folded into the dynamics of ecological impact on the climate. Rather than bifurcating the interests of peoples and place, they presented an integrated view of interdependence and belonging that resisted many of the double binds and false choices of our age. Thank you for the sweeping historical foundation to continue on with the other courses. I can't wait! ",0,0,Brittany Deininger,101065950
