55633301~COURSE!~0eRK5qElEeaUxQ4a06yGng,1599325188206,3,0,"The course was informative and helpful for both physicians and providers based on content. However, I do think that based on other courses that are available for physicians this course happened to be one of the more redundant and drawn out courses that could have easily been made more succinct. Within the provider sections alone there seemed to be no collaboration between the lecturers as some repeated the same information over and over which made the course irritating at times. This course could be so much better if better planned between the speakers. But in terms of what I learned, I would say it was good just a little to repetitive as someone in the field.

41195652~COURSE!~0eRK5qElEeaUxQ4a06yGng,1632917633472,5,0,"The key takeaway from this exhaustive and well-done offering is that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is not just a drug to prevent getting infected specifically by HIV but a process towards ensuring optimal sexual health. Indeed, the material vividly reflected this reality. This is the first course I have taken whose is explicit goal is to connect comprehensively with not just either a wide net of audience (usually making the material to be “too light” for those with experiences and competencies in the topic) or a small group of specialists – rather, there are components meant for practitioners and clients/patients. The course creators delivered a holistic view of the process itself and the relevant circumstances that either enable or hamper its implementation. I highly recommend this course to everyone – health professionals, the casually-interested, and past/present/prospective clients alike – so that more people can contribute in the whole-of-society approach against HIV/AIDS and other sexually-transmitted infections.
