As a 4th year medical student, I see that the information is superficial. I finished the course in around 3 weeks, so medical students wouldn't get so much benefit out of the course. I wanted to learn more details, specially in depth about each type of the 5 cancers from the basics to clinical. Secondly, there was no interaction between the students and the doctor supervising the course in the discussion blogs. Thirdly, I believe that the assessment was too easy. I suggest a 60% passing grade with a more challenging assessment. Finally, this is my personal opinion. I enjoyed the course and I would like to see more improvement in the future.

is to be expected; think about why a university might offer an online

""Experts"" who couldn't pronounce words (""genome"", ""radionuclide"") used 
in their own area of expertise.  Factually incorrect information, like 
""both copies of a gene must have a mutation for cancer to occur"", which 
is not true for many genes.  Also, a strong tendency to use words, 
abbreviations, and acronyms that have never been defined, which is not 
appropriate for an ""introduction"" to something.

Given that slide graphics is repetetive (there are probably 10 images overall that are reused over and over), a lot is left to the imagination. Overall amount of content is quite low for 6 week course. E.g. one of the weeks only has 15minutes of video and a 10-question quiz. Quizzes and in-video questions seem like they were prepared by different people altogether. There are spelling mistakes, there are terms used during quizzes which have not been used during the videos, some of the questions are just poorly worded or bad from grammar point of view. Generally they are useful nevertheless.

Concerning the course, although the content was really good, I need to make some comments in order to improve the course. Except from the first doctor, all the other speakers spoke very very fast and it was difficult to follow as a non native speaker even though my English is very good. It would have been better to talk a little bit slower. Also, I would make the course a little bit longer, a few more steps in between the lessons, slower meaning more explaining. Also, I would have appreciated if the lecturers were speaking facing the screen a bit more, not just showing slides. I would have also given some case studies. The course lacked case studies. For example I would have given at the end a whole week of cases studies, ie 6 case studies of people who had cancer, what type of treatment they had, others that did not have treatment as well. I would also have a quiz on these. Furthermore, I would have given some examples of alternative therapies too as working as complementary for example to treatment of cancer.

the cell-cycle. Cell-cycle
checkpoints can be found in S, G2 and M-phases. Upon checkpoint-dependent cell-cycle arrest,
cells do not exit the cell-cycle and, thus, they do not re-enter the cell-cycle
once checkpoints have been satisfied. That is, they stay within the cell-cycle.
Exit would entail senescence, which is theoretically irreversible (although it
can be overcome). Hence, after arrest, cells could not exit the cell-cycle (Cyclins and Cdks are
kept in check, for example, by p21 upon activation of the DNA-damage response
to double strand breaks [ATM/Chk2/p53/p21). Speaking of senescence, fates stemming from p53 activation can be apoptosis but also
senescence. Thus, avoiding cell-death is critical, but so is avoiding senescence
(p53/p21-dependent).  Finally, G0 is quiescence, not senescence.
Quiescence is a reversible withdrawal from the cell-cycle whilst senescence is
not. PD-L1/2 upregulation exhausts cytotoxic T-cells within the tumor
microenvironment by activating PD-1. Howbeit, the activation of CTLA4 also
inhibit T-cell function outside of the tumor microenvironment in a previous
stage. CTLA4 inhibitory antibodies are under intense research and such research
preceded that of PD-1
inhibitory antibodies. I feel CTLA4
should be mentioned. ",0,0,Chaska Walton,30500268

I LOVED everything I learned. I was so eager and excited every time I opened up my course and started learning. I felt stupid at the beginning but I reminded myself that I was gonna feel SO SMART when I finally understood this. If you're doubting yourself, JUST KEEP GOING. If you feel dumb, it's okay bc let's be real, we're all dumb about cancer biology until we learn. You probably don't know any of this stuff, BUT YOU WILL.

That being said: there were a few spots where the transcripts were wrong and it really threw me off.    I learn by reading, not at all by hearing . I NEED those transcripts. For example ""ligand"" was written as ""lag end"" or something and it messed me up for a bit. There were a few times when I had to stop and go back and figure out what he meant but overall, I ended up GETTING it. 

Cancer touches all of our lives in one way or another and this course gives the average Joe the tools and information to understand what's going on. Hopefully we can build on that and eradicate it some day.
