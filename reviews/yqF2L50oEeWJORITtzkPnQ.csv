It's a very good course for early Greek literature, and its title should reflect that.  One more thing, the lectures were very conversational, almost too much...it was difficult to follow and hard to determine what info should be noted and what could be just conversation.  Perhaps a bit more preparation on the part of the instructor would help.  I enjoyed the overview/interpretation of Homer's Odyssey, but the syllabus said the suggested reading was not mandatory...I think it was considering some of the lectures didn't cover areas that were in the reading, and reading the text would have greatly helped when taking the tests.",0,0,Dawn Riordan,80873003

However, by the middle to end, the quality of the lectures started degrading-- I felt like the professor was talking in circles and at times I was unable to figure out what he was trying to say. Summarizing and taking notes became a lot harder. I'm not sure how much of this was due to the terrible quality of the transcript. There are literally parts that are annotated as [UNKNOWN] or [SOUND] mid-sentence. There is also a lot of grammatical error. Although much of the readings were not compulsory, there are test questions about the myth that you would only know from the reading and not from what's learned in the lecture. In this case, it would probably be better to just mark them as necessary so that everyone is on the same page. ",0,14,Evelyn Trinh,47191014

What is the instructor wanting to show us, beyond ""horrible and nasty""?

It covers a vast amount of Gods, Goddesses, creatures and legendary moral beings. I had hope it would give a deeper dive into the study of Ovid and Aeneid. However, it would probably lengthen the course into a Part 2 type of structure. I do hope more classes are offered to have a detailed review on the classics. I did study Homer back in College and we spent a semester each on Iliad and Odyssey. I felt there was not enough time to be spent on most of the books, however given the nature of the course and the depth for an introductory, it is understandable.A great companion piece on Amazon can be found - GREAT GREEK MYTHS.

childhood, and I took this course to experience how a prestigious institution
treats such material. Suffice to say, I was pleasantly surprised on how it went
from Week 1 to Week 10. I actually felt that I was in a serious introductory
class on classics, as this course goes beyond what the average person expects
of mythology being considered trivial and dealt with in terms of what can be
memorized. This offering excellently provides a scholarly overview of selected
Greek and Roman mythology literature and their underlying history and “humanity”
– as products of the prevalent societal psyche of their era. The eye-opening analytic
attempts from various fields such as psychology and sociology, through Dr.
Struck’s “universal laws” and “toolbox,” have improved my view on the importance
of humanities and literature in documenting and perpetuating the zeitgeist. As
someone with no advanced degree on this field, perhaps my only criticism of
this course is the imbalance of coverage of Greek and Roman mythology in terms
of the number of weeks – I hope that Dr. Struck can expand this course in such
a way that half of the course will be about the former and another half will be
about the latter.I strongly recommend taking this course while committing to
read first the recommended weekly material. If one is not able to acquire the
specific translation, I think that any decent reading that can give enough
context to what is being discussed will be okay at minimum.   ",0,0,Aedrian Abrilla,41195652

Before this course I found Greek Mythology so perplexing and only knew the basics from Grade 5 History Class and Disney's Hercules (+ the Dwayne Johnson Hercules Movie + other classic Hercules and Greek Myth Adaptations) + Geronimo Stilton's Adaptation of the Odyssey for Kids + Rick Riordan's adaptation for teens in the Percy Jackson Series that I watched aged 10 in 2010 too. Nevertheless, I was always very interested in Greek and Roman Mythology and wanted to learn about it deeper and get a digestible oversight and overview about what it was about. And Peter Struck was the BEST Professor anyone could've ever asked for. Not only was he engaging, super interested and knowledgable in the subject itself and witty, he found so many interlinks and compared the Mythology of today with its meanings and was able to analyse it with different tools and lenses, such as deeper meaning Functionalism, Binary comparison Structuralism, Freudian Psychoanalysis, Fontanelle Studies, Defining Mythology in different ways (though preferring the definition by academic Buckert) and through Allegories and . You will love and want to plunge into the worlds of Homer, Virgil, Ovid and more - and THANK YOU Mr. Peter Struck for explaining everything so detailedly and vivaciously and always doing it in such a way that was engaging and never boring. Thus, through this course, you'll realise it's more inter-disciplinary and pulling reigns from the domains of Psychology, Sociology and more and you may end up not only with an increased Athena-style wisdom and foundation, but also with better tools to compare literary parallels and be able to read and understand the motivations of the characters in the plays of the Iliad, Odyssey, Homer's Hymns, Aeniad and more (there are many lovely plays to discover here, whether for the first time or for a review trip down memory lane).

Existem várias teorias (muitas vezes conflitantes entre si) para explicar os mitos e seus fundamentos. Por ser complexo, cada teoria e cada parte da história são subdivididas em vários vídeos. Os temas são complexos e ao mesmo tempo fascinantes. A leitura antecipada dos livros indicados faz com que os vídeos sejam ainda melhores, pois muitas vezes jogam interpretações e análises que não conseguimos perceber ao lermos sozinhos. O contrário também é muito útil, principalmente com Virgílio: Assistir aos vídeos antes pode facilitar bastante a leitura desta obra complexa.

16837252~COURSE!~yqF2L50oEeWJORITtzkPnQ,1474727964558,5,0,"This course is exceptional. in large part because Professor Struck  is thoroughly skilled, knowledgeable and enthusiastic in his lectures. From the first lecture, and consistently throughout the course, he imbues the material with both contemporary relevance and historical connections. He makes the student a part of the conversation, and always ties together concepts that in less skilled hands might seem disparate.  He lends his own intellectual brand of assocations to certain of the more complex ideas, thus rendering them accessible to learners who are new to the literature, history, ""litcrit"" and psychology of myth. Perhaps most important, Professor Struck's love of his subject(s) is infectious; though he does not appear to teach another Coursera course, I am sufficiently interested now, to take the other offering Greek history on Coursera. However, I wish that he were teaching a continuation of the class. As he said in the final lecture, we but skimmed the surface. It would be awesome if he could lead a more in-depth journey into the creations of these poets and their peers. I also appreciate the fact that Professor Struck recommended excellent editions of the texts. There are so many from which to choose; it was a gift to have his recommendation. I highly recommend this class. You will learn about myth - and you will learn about learning.",0,9,eileen rick,16837252
