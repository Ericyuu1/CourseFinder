1569643~COURSE!~QHSFA24mEeeWCg71xNIlJg,1670589522834,3,0,"I found the material very interesting and very thankful for the instructor, university and coursera for this opportunity to learn. However it would have a much better experience if the following were improved:- The course, unfortunately, appears orphaned. There is little involvement from actual instructor or TAs. Forums have automated posts from the instructor, but little actual content. Posts from other students are mostly spam (with a few exceptions that are far between). - Peer graded assignments did not get any actionable feedback from graders (other peers). This makes it hard to see mistakes. Unfortunately in some cases the best way to pass is to just resubmit exact same work and have a different set of eyes look at it. Moreover there is a ridiculous amount of junk submissions from other peers (random screenshots, random PDFs, excel sheets etc).- I found instructor's material delivery hard to follow at times - mostly there would be some assumptions that they state with no explanation.- Assignments have some obvious errors and typos. Given that this course has been around since 2017, I would have expected those to be ironed out by now (2022). This supports the point about this course being orphaned.- Lecture material does not cover enough for solving some of the assignments. In a way this is OK and encourages additional research, however it would help to make this more explicit that this material is not covered and we are expected to read up.",0,0,oleg ryjkov,1569643
