He basically just talked about crptography for 3 hours. For example, the whole third week is about Hash Functions, but he only talked about it as an idea. Go through just ONE crypthographic hash function so that people understand what it is. I've taken Data Structure and Algorithms, which is why I already know what they are, but it was still extremely hard to follow because he was talking about cryptographic hash functions and not hash functions for hash tables. The difference between preimage and second preimage was probably the only time he used any sort of example, but even that wasn't fully mapped back to cryptography. I'm going to try the second course in the specialization, but if it was anything like this, I won't continue.",0,0,Kunle Ogundeji,38527870

First, it is listed as a beginner course, but some of the probability concepts aren't explained directly in the course. Another observation is that almost all of the aditional readings provided are from Wikipedia - I get that many courses need to have a self-taught part for the student to better comprehend the concepts or get a deeper understanding, but had I wanted to read only Wikipedia articles I could've done that without enrolling to this course. Lastly, I think it lacks exercises to put the knowledge into practice.

Content of this course is way too old. Encryption/decryption of English characters are dinosaur technologies for telegraph, which itself has disappeared in modern communications. Too many historical tales, too few modern technologies, and almost no technical details or math.
