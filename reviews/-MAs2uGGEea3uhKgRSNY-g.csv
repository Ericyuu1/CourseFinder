This is not the case with the course. The intro videos are short and of nondescript nature. The materials are not prepared for an audience at all. Scanning pages of a 70 year old book, no matter how relevant the context still is, is just bad. It is not engaging at all, just plain boring. One video of a TED talk from week 2 had no relation whatsoever to social emotional learning at all.

12842205~COURSE!~-MAs2uGGEea3uhKgRSNY-g,1634284297494,4,0,"A very interesting course that focuses on the social and emotional aspects of teaching. Although at the beginning it was a bit strange to read some texts that are over 100 years old. But, the study of old and new writings is very enlightening.
This course contains a lot of reading material. This is unusual for a MOOC, but makes it easier to read almost anywhere.
Ultimately, the message of the course is that teaching is very personal, satisfying but also hard work. In phases with the right inner readiness (love for the subject, the learners and oneself; joy, commitment, passion, ...) teaching is a dream. But this is not always the case and dry spells have to be overcome. That is hard work.

It helped me a lot to know that it is going to depend on myself how to overcome the negative ones.  As a constructive comment, I would say that the readings are too long and complex for non-native speakers, like me.  I would rather videos explaining them like the ones you included in the last week.  Thanks for everything, I´m sure I receive great tools to analyze myself and to find the ways to improve.
