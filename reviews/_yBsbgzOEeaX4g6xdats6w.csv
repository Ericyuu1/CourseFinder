The final project could be a great learning experience, too. There are two major flaws, though. First, the case study for the final reads like a first draft and also needs proofreading. The case itself is really interesting, but information is presented haphazardly. It also needs careful proofreading (one of the executives is alternatively referred to as ""she"" and ""he."" It's hard to tell who or what is being talked about sometimes. Second, the plagiarism in the final project submissions is out of control.
