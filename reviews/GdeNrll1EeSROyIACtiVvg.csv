The final section, especially, is simply about passing exams. It never questions whether exams are actually effective or relevant to learning. Finally, there is the testing in the course. It goes against most of the ideas they taught. All of the questions are multiple-answer, often repeating the videos word for word, relying on superficial cues to finding the correct answer rather than actually knowing the material. The questions are also in the same order that they appear in the videos, which is exactly what they've advised not to do in the videos. Many of the possible answers are also obviously wrong, making it extremely easy to distinguish between the correct answers based on irrelevant information.It's not a completely worthless course, but it should be taken as a very small start, in my opinion.

The pomodoro technique is nice to know about, though I have rarely used it so far. I think I was already at the point where I don't need an actual pomodoro timer to get into that mindset. The best two things I probably got from the course was changing my way of thinking from focusing on product to focusing on process (though not always possible of course), and using recall to test myself on what I know rather than reading things over and over and just hoping it's gone in.What I didn't like about the course was the presentation style, the pace, the content density (very low in my opinion), the irrelevant information, the hand-wavey explanations, and so on. The absolute worst of it was the full recommendation for using analogies but with no attempt on explaining how to make *good* anaologies. This is key. Most analogies I come across are misleading for all aspects of a thing but their very narrow scope, and sometimes the thing itself too (after all, you usually make them when you're first learning about a thing, unless you're teaching) and so without knowing how to make good anaologies while they are good for memory they are on average bad for understanding, and I don't think that can be stressed enough.",0,3,Jake Evan Palmer,1916314

I like how the study tasks were only a few minutes long and broken into several lessons. This helped the time go by faster and I felt as if I were learning then moving on quickly. The only reason I did not give this course 5 Stars is do to the poor sound quality. Barbera's low quiet voice was difficult to focus on and I had to turn up the volume too high. Then when the other professor began speaking he spoke normally and it was too loud with the volume up so high.

I loved Barbara's eloquent narrations and her voice and style kept me occupied. Great insights from Dr. Sejnowski on human brains, I think I learnt a few terms for a non biology person.On of the reasons I proceeded with the course was to understand the reasons for procrastination and overcome the same. Though the course had taught  few techniques to overcome I feel they scratched the surface of procrastination itself. I didn't do optional videos to know if they have covered bit more over there.Overal the course resonated what I have thought, believed or practiced on how to go about learning something new. Thus, it actually helped me validate my methods plus learnt additional insights on how our brain works and few more techniques to become a better learner. Regarding quizzes, I felt they were too simple and repetitive. Maybe they purposely made it inline with what the course was trying to teach us. At least, they could update the time duration to 10 minutes or so for quizzes/reviews that had 4 to 6 questions. Most quizzes I could complete in  5 to 10 minutes.

Good course with some very interesting techniques/facts about how we know the brain to learn new information.

Barbara Oakley does a good job of presenting. Terry Sejnowski has some 
valuable information too, but his on-camera awkwardness was a bit 
distracting from what he was communicating.

Course is very focused on college students, but the information is very 
much still valid for all others looking to optimize their learning of 
new subjects.

Was it worth my time as someone working in the tech industry? Definitely.

Recommended.

Something that I do on my lists is I add short fun tasks that are easy to complete and I tell myself that I can do the fun tasks if I do the more undesirable tasks first. I also find that highlighting things on my to do list is like a little pat on the back for completing tasks and less messy then crossing things off which would then distract me and I would have to rewrite my list so it's neat. I will most definitely apply the tips and tricks I've learned such as writing lists before bed to my day to day and not just for tough subjects. Thank you!,0,0,Crystal Ionson,43163901

A feature which I liked very much is the message that, by applying these techniques, also those who are not specially gifted in a field (the ""less brilliant"") can nevertheless obtain good results. If I can suggest an improvement, is to add more  detailed information about the brain, how it works, how neural cells interact each other and with the other parts of the body, how the brain evolves in the life of an individual, from birth to old age. These information may shed some more light on the brain functioning and may provide a firmer foundation for the understanding and the application of the study techniques outlined in this course.

The lecturers are able to group seemingly scattered ideas in a systematic way and gradually tell us the core of learning and introduce relevant techniques. If you are a good learner, you probably can echo with a lot of these techniques which you are already subconsciously applying in your learning process. It of course doesn't hurt to refresh and reinforce those key ideas. If you are struggling at learning, it is good to learn to change your behaviour in learning, although on this aspect the course is still quite abstract and it does require a lot of extra determination and self-regulation to be able to make those changes. For me learning is a combination of techniques and perseverance. Absence of either is detrimental. This course teaches general techniques and you are required to decide your own techniques that work with you the best for a specific subject. Perseverance is sustained by motivation - this is what this course lacks (it does introduce the idea of practice though but how to keep practising?). Why do we learn? What are we seeking in learning a specific subject? Ask these questions and get convincing answers to yourself is key to be able to hold on and not give up halfway.",0,0,Jia Pan,35232586

- lack of in-depth view; Dr. Sejnowski did some effort on subject, but still. Mentioning neuroscience makes me expect much deeper immersion

Maybe I've read too much on the subject already, but there was nothing fundamentally new to me in terms of strategies or brain mechanics.  I hoped to find something new, because I haven't found ""my"" strategy yet. However, there were tons of more in-depth information I appreciated and I will have lots of material in forms of citations, references and links I will further explore in the future still. Maybe sone of this will provide a twist or change to something I've already tried and make it more effective. You can definitively see that the creators put a lot of enthusiasm and effort into it.The only thing I really wish they hadn't done was falling into the advertisement trap of proclaiming that some of their techniques are seemingly ""easy"" or need ""minimal effort"". I nearly dismissed the course after the ""harvest your zombies"" video, because it felt so much like cheap advertising and also a bit dismissive of the struggles and efforts connected to this.They always got more realistic relatively fast, especially if you also listened to the bonus interviews with all the experts still having the same struggles that we all face while learning, but it still left a somewhat bad aftertaste.Also the end focussed a bit too much on just explicitely test-taking, which is not what I am facing anymore, but I recognize that lots of people probably came to the course to find strategies for exactly these stituations.In general: they present a lot of nice strategies to try, just don't let them fool you that it will be easy.",0,0,Judith Fronczek,29601121

This course teaches you a bit about the science of learning based on psychological and neuroscientific research, as well as the experiences of educators. It also provides a number of helpful tips that can assist you in understanding and memorizing new concepts in any field. However, I think this course has more ""filler"" than necessary. Some videos will spend 6 minutes making one or two good points that could be made in a minute and half. Personal anecdotes, redundancy, theories behind why certain techniques in learning work the way they do, etc. contribute to this ""filler."" It's not that I don't find some of this stuff interesting, but when I start a video, I want to focus on the fresh subject of that particular video and how it will help me learn. The personal anecdotes and theorizing would fit better in the ""optional material"" section. The redundancy is entirely unnecessary and is actually a bit like ""rereading"" in a way, which is a point the course teaches you is ineffective. Make your point clearly, then test us to see if we understand it. It does not need to be rehashed throughout the course. Further examples and explanation can be provided in the ""optional material"" section if people want to read more about it.Secondly, quizzes should be more difficult. They contribute to an ""illusion of confidence,"" which is another concept that the course itself discusses and urges you to avoid. I honestly feel that many of the questions have such common sense answers that I could've skipped several videos altogether and still passed some units. They could be designed better to see if people genuinely understand the perspectives and techniques that this course offers.Despite my critiques that this course would benefit from some sharpening of the lectures, and more difficult questions, I enjoyed it, and am glad I took it.

27328868~COURSE!~GdeNrll1EeSROyIACtiVvg,1500365866360,4,0,"  If you're like me, you probably thought that the steps to proper learning were obvious. And in a sense, they are obvious, so you'd be right. Those people who told you to stop procrastinating, start early, and try harder/smarter if you weren't putting in enough effort/reasoning were right. But most of those people who tell you those things only focus on trying to persuade you into doing better. They never tell you HOW to do it better.If you're stuck in understanding the how of learning, this course is great in helping you figure that out (I mean, that's kind of what it's supposed to do considering the title, but take this as a confirmation from an ""alumni"" of this course. I put the quotes because I'm not sure if that term is appropriate, but humor me for a bit).Adding on to what I said earlier in this review, this course does indeed talk about the obvious in terms of being a good student, but it also goes a step above that by providing details that I never even considered. Now I understand the process of learning better, and because I understand a little better, I've become more motivated in trying new things out. I guess what I'm trying to say is that even if you learn noting from this course, this course can help you re-open your mind if it ever felt closed at any point in your life.The only reason why I'm not giving this course a perfect score is because while this course teaches you how to learn, it's hard to confirm if it actually works. Yes, it tests you now and then to see if you actually understand what it's trying to teach, and personally I think it does a pretty good job at it, but I have yet to find out if this applies to other topics that I want to learn. It seems that the course tries to get your feet wet with the learning that you have ahead of you too, but until I actually get to those topics and try to understand them in greater depth, I can't really confirm if these learning methods that were presented will be effective for said topics.But I hope you won't let my uncertainty scare you. While I don't know about how the rest of my learning will go or what it has in store for me, finishing this course has gotten me to look forward to studying them. It's made me more active than I've been in a while, and I can't be more excited than I currently am to tackle new subjects and broaden my horizons.So to close up this review, the last thing I want to say is that I would not waste my time writing this extensive review if I didn't think it was enjoyable or worth the time. For me, it clearly was. In fact, I've never written a review this long. This is a first. Consider me a believer of this course, because I am convinced it did something for me. I don't regret going through any of these lessons one bit. Thanks for reading.tl;dr - If you think you know how to get good at learning, then you probably do, but this course can help you get even better at it because it has details to learning that may not seem as obvious. It was worth my time, and I feel like a better person after finishing it.  ",0,0,YM,27328868

It is backed by solid research and is presented in an user-friendly way. It will drastically improve your ability to absorb and retain new material.  The techniques, tips, quizzes, discussion forums, additional reading material, interviews are all very helpful. I enjoyed doing the course and looked forward to each week's session.My only reason for deducting a star is that occasionally they get carried away by the analogies and metaphors in order to explain a concept (a case in point is the module on chunking). And then you are left wondering how do you actually apply it to a real subject - the metaphor is very well done but the real-life example is something that was not clearly explained. That said it is an occasional issue and almost all of the course holds up well. You will find many counter-intuitive ideas (such as highlighting is not as effective as making notes in the margin; exercise and sleep actually help your brain) and useful techniques (such as deliberate practice, interleaving, pomodoro technique to beat procrastination, recalling, spaced repetition etc.) to help your learning.I think school children from 13-14 years upwards of age can grasp much of the course on their own.

It won't blow your mind with advanced techniques you haven't heard before, but it is a nice succinct overview of what works better and what doesn't work so well. I picked up a few tips and had to sheepishly admit that I was guilty in the past of studying in a less than ideal way (I have a Bachelors degree). I would say this is a particularly useful course for young adults to take as it's not too heavy and is useful in explaining to them how to be more effective and why the techniques in the course work. That is not to say of course, that it is not useful for all ages. I found Barbara to be reasonably effective as a presenter. She speaks a little slowly for my taste, but I sped up the playback speed to 1.25 and that made it comfortable. Her lectures are well thought out and smoothly delivered.I found Terry Sejnowski contributed little to the course however. His explanations were fumbling, muddled and confusing. I found myself reading Wikipedia more often then not to get a better explanation on the concepts he was supposed to be teaching. He just didn't explain them well. He also didn't really explain why he was explaining them at all. The lecture on neurotransmitters was particularly bad. In what way did any of that help me learn how to learn? I think most of his lectures are just not that necessary to the course. I also think Barbara could have done a better job herself. But I understand her wanted to include him as he is an apparent authority in the area and it lends some credibility to her course. I think it's well worth taking and again I think this would be ideal for school kids (secondary) to help instill good practices early and steer them around a couple of easy to make mistakes.",0,0,Callum Baillie,16554114

I really liked the discussion of focused and diffused modes as well as how you're supposed to chunk things you're trying to learn int small bits to better understand it.The course covers also a bit of neuroscience and how learning really works in the brain. It was interesting to know that the working memory is very limited while the long term memory is basically unlimited so trying to remember too many things at once just doesn't work. The great thing is that the course provides a lot of supplementary material that you can delve deeper into if you want to know about something. One of the papers cited talked about 10 different learning techniques and it was a revelation to me that highlighting text is actually not efficient in learning. Overall the course was nice, I found the quizzes a bit too close to what was said in the lecture. It might have been better to get a reading assignment that delves deeper into something and then some questions on it. ",0,0,Diaa A,4536301

6970781~COURSE!~GdeNrll1EeSROyIACtiVvg,1450819888856,4,0,"I've been struggling with the learning process since high school. Over the years I've initially approached the chance to learn with enthusiasm and determination (""this time it will be different""), only to be derailed by unwavering perfectionism and the steadfast conviction that I can't possible live up to expectations (""if I'm not perfect, then it doesn't mean anything""). I've fled more often than not, taking a fail or missing an opportunity rather than face the possibility of being merely average, or worse. So taking Learning How to Learn was not just about understanding the process of learning from a tactical point of view, but showing that I could follow my goal all the way through to the end. Fortunately Learning How to Learn provides a very supportive environment in which to learn and, importantly, make mistakes, without the whole world come tumbling down. The purpose of the course is not to identify the good learners from the bad learners, but to provide everyone with the chance to learn in a non-competitive way. As someone who has feared learning for a long time, it was incredibly, monumentally important that Learning How to Learn be a place to enjoy the process of learning, rather than the outcome of it. And that's what the course provided. I'm going to be testing the ideas and strategies from Learning How to Learn over the next few months, leading up to the start of my second year at university. My goal is to focus on the process of learning, not the product (an important point from the course). It's my first small step in overcoming my fear. ",0,0,Louise Angrilli,6970781

There has not been a single test I've taken where I took a nap and did not score within the top 5%. Everything I learned here will further augment what I know by experience but did not have scientific research to back up. Everything I learned will help me explain to others what it is I do to learn efficiently and how they can go about doing the same thing (maybe not falling asleep on a test ;P).

I believe I would have ended up giving up, had I not learned the wealth of information and study practices I did here.It is much more like a equip you with a  class than an informative little class-let for something you might be curious about. It begins at the beginning ( so there is no need to come into it with any kind of previous study of the science of learning) and moves through a TON of in-depth, science-based material. The topics covered naturally come together as you are progressing through it to build a toolkit of skills that will make learning any new and difficult information much, much easier. Material is easier to absorb, and retention, if you use the skills you have learned, is solid. I enjoyed the class a great deal, which is enough on its own. But the skills I brought from this class to learning something as far outside my natural abilities as coding made it almost seem...easy. i can not recommend tyhis class enough to anyone, everyone. It is so empowering to understand the way neural pathways are formed and the way the brain anchors information using relationships between the new material and what you already know. Realizing the importance of and the structure of good study/sleep balance to really lock in the new info makes all the difference. To cover the probable questions you may have: The teachers are great, it's easy and clear to understand, the pace is lovely, and they don't overwhelm you with high level terminology but they definitely do not dumb it down.

Recent circumstances saw me looking for a career change but my inability to properly learn new content proved to be my downfall.  I considered myself to be teachable so I did not understand why I suddenly was not successful at learning. After all, I was a successful learner in high school many years ago.  Nevertheless, completing this 'Learning How to Learn' course came to me as a requirement to get accepted into a job training program I applied to. I can truly say that the value this course brought to me has been remarkable. Not long after starting this course, I realized the obstacle all along was that I did not properly know how to learn. Now that I have completed this course of study, with high school long gone behind me, I was not then so well equipped. Today, however,  I find myself equipped and empowered to successfully pursue a career change, even if it means going to college as an adult. I have learned how to learn! Thank goodness! I feel like the sky is the limit and I can go out into the world and attain my dreams. I do not doubt that this course will benefit anyone interested in successfully learning how to learn and who does not know how to go about it. So let me invite you, be encouraged, and come on while I salute you!

This course is very beginner friendly and serves wonderfully as a resource to put you into a productive and upbeat mindset when dealing with having to study. It does appear to be quite old given the presentation style and graphics, however, this should not deter the learner as the production quality is still fairly well done. The course itself will not teach you any amazing secret techniques to ace all of your exams, but will rather build a solid understanding of how we learn, and some techniques anyone could employ to improve their learning skills.

Her tone of voice is very pleasant and she presented the content very clearly. I really enjoyed watching the bonus interviews on different fields of study.

It is one of the most complex phenomena considering the fact that everything else that is learned consciously or unconsciously is hinged on it. When I stumbled on the concept of “learning how to learn” on Cousera, I was more than excited to delve into it and see what it was all about. Indeed, the content  in the course has so far surpassed my expectations. Learning isn’t always fun, sometimes while learning you get stuck on ideas that you cannot seem to figure out. However, through persistence and observing simple learning rules it becomes worthwhile.A very big thank you to Barbara Oakley and Terry Sejnowski for this amazing, explicit, detailed yet concise course. I have learned so much from you. I have gained clarity in some concepts that were hitherto confusingHaving listened to Benny Lewis on the subject of leaning languages in his interview with Barbara Oakley during the course of this lesson, my passion was re-ignited. He opined that the best way to learn a language is to speak without the fear of making mistakes, this is because paying so much attention to mistakes will inhibit the learning process and might dampen the learner’s interest.

With this course, professors Oakley and Sejnowski offer support and encouragement, and they tied all of these concepts together with unified model of the brain, describing how these techniques and developments in science really could transform my life and encouraging me to believe in and trust the process and do it in a way that wasn't overwhelming and prevents automatic processes and inertia from taking over.

I finished law (practicing for almost 10 years now) and can assure you studying would be a much easier and happier period of my life if I had this knowledge. Many of the positive practices and mistakes one is familiar with, but they really sound different when said out loud with examples and scientific background.

I would even argue this course is an absolute must when it comes to social (humanistic) studies and studies where you can't gain much practical knowledge, i.e. legal studies. You learn from the book, but you get seldom practice during your studies. Only when you start working, you learn all over again. So, for the type of studies where you are on your own with enormous amount of pages to learn, I would say this course is an absolute must for your sanity. For everybody else as well, of course, cause it provides valuable knowledge, but students of the 'me and my books' type of studies can really benefit.

Instructors are excellent, interviews are interesting, thank you for this course!

Best,

Empfehlenswert!

85502616~COURSE!~GdeNrll1EeSROyIACtiVvg,1626276028224,5,0,"I started this course because I'm interested in becoming a Software Developer and started following a curriculum created by Developers called ""The Odin Project."" In the curriculum of The Odin Project, it's recommended that the ""Learning How to Learn"" course be enrolled in to learn the most efficient ways to learn so that your ability to understand the vast concepts necessary to be a successful Software Developer are less daunting and actually achievable. At least, that's how I understood what I was enrolling myself into.

I was pleasantly surprised to learn many new things about myself, my own processes of learning, (and how I've been holding myself back from doing so efficiently) and to learn that I most certainly am not alone in the world of academics. We all have things we procrastinate on doing, but sometimes it's easy to forget that when you're swimming in your own sea of craziness.

After completing this course, I feel that I understand how the brain processes learning new information, and how best I can retain that information for the future, in addition to being able to interleave my learning so it's useful to me across many different things in life, not just the thing(s) I'm trying to learn now. I also now have a better understanding of procrastination and the things I can do to help conquer it.

There's a lot more in this course, and I highly recommend it to everyone. Any person that wants to truly learn and educate themselves, not waste time doing things inefficiently, and accomplish their goals should take this course. This course can not only help you achieve your learning goals, but it can help you with your everyday life and how you process information.

There are lots of opinions on how to learn, which from this course it has provided me with research-based outputs that somehow or the other gave me a new understanding of learning approaches and techniques. Some parts are actually within my knowledge and practice, such as metaphors and analogies + visualization.The teamwork seems to provide great reflection material. As I found that sometimes I am uneasy to perform all the time teamwork as sometimes my opinions are rejected because of my less influential behaviour. And, having a community that looks high on opinions, the influential skills are considered as a leadership norm in teamwork. However, spotting errors and noticing them from other team members are really useful. For example, when we are developing software that requires counter checking our codes. That is why we are now practising Pair Programming, even many similar communities do.Great course.

I came here to acquire 20% of the most valuable tools to learn more efficient (which would give me 80% of the result). I've found exactly that and more! Each tool basically is explained via a similar framework, though not always in that order: a problem (e.g. hard to undestand math), a scientific explanation of a reason (e.g. math is abstract => less connections in the brain => harder to recognize patterns), a tested tool as a solution (e.g. find or create easier to grasp physical metaphors which will create required patterns  via a ""side door"").I've found more, because I have understood that without the consistency and focus no result can be achieved - both for work or learning, for the latter especially. Now I am actively integrating the knowledge from course to my life and can already see the improvements!My advice - if you want to seriously grow, please take time and patience to REALLY understand the concepts and REALLY integrate them in your life.

Just the discovery of the insanely simple but deeply effective Pomodoro technique alone was worth the time investment. I'm going to use memory palaces, hard-jump-to-easy strategies, positive thinking, consistent but reasonable study hours, and the importance placed on sleep and exercise to turn my life around and pursue the goals that have been lingering on my to-do list for the last few years. I know I'll do it know.Drs. Oakley and Sejnowski are to me what Mr. Rogers are to other people--they are kind and warm academics that make the coursework fun. I like that they use humor and funny visuals to help cement concepts into your mind.

It gives the scientific fundamentals as well as strategies to improve learning ability,

keep the faith when your team questions whatever you do. I could survive
fleeing my country and the camp daily routine and many other issues but not the
chaotic uncertain environment which created the inadequacy feeling that
suffocated me till Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski opened my eyes to see all the
doors. Just learning about Imposter Syndrome opened those doors. In my journal,
the first entry is “Learning is not enough to put the information into
practice. I have been teaching those ideas and bringing those tools to my
students for years but, personally speaking, a tomato is not enough to reduce the
tension or to create a shelter during the lockdown. I will stop this course!”“a tomato
to stay focused and an apple to keep the doctor away and deep sleeping to live
healthy, I need no more”, I doted these words in Arabic. ",0,0,Samah Al Jundi-Pfaff,2202227

Dr. Oakley and Dr. Sejnowski discussed a lot of interesting things about
 the underlying concept of learning. They don't just tell you how to do 
the techniques, they make you understand why you should do the 
techniques, and in turn you'd find that they are very effective and 
helpful. The tests were like practical applications of the discussed 
concept. This course is very useful, i hope i have come across this sooner. Thank you Dr. Oakley and Dr.

Taking ""Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects"" and know that there is scientific research to back up the research, has been a eye opener, that anyone can learn new material no matter what the subject.  I believe anyone who has ever doubted their ability to learn any new material, or has a ""I cannot do this"" attitude should take this class: that would be me.  I always thought I had a learning challenge, turns out me and millions of others do too.  A lot of this is the ability to believe in yourself, keep an I can do attitude and to know that it is okay to make mistakes, to use that as a learning too.  Don't let anyone tell you, you can't do something...give it a try, with all your might, heart and brain power.

I found this course very interesting and useful. I think anybody 
interested in learning any kind of subject or skill, either 
intellectual, physical or both, will gain a lot by taking this course.
I wish I had known these things when I was getting my degree in 
University. And I'm convinced even kids as young as 10 should be taught 
some of these techniques, even if some details could be skipped in that 
case.
Another great thing about this course is the amazing delivery of 
Professor Barbara Oakley. She has a great way of talking that keeps one 
paying attention to every word. I've seen some MOOC where the person 
looks bored and like he/she is just reading a text without any emphasis.
 Professor Barbara Oakley, on the other  hand, shows just the right 
level of excitement when teaching the material. Not looking bored and 
not over the top. Just perfect. Her interviews are also very 
interesting. Five stars, for sure.

We are trained in first year to learn properly. Quickly read the lecture beforehand, ask questions, do the practice tutorials the day before, read over the notes you made during the say, get enough sleep and so on. Many of the things taught in the course I already knew, but the major difference is why we should be doing such things.  You just should. However, now being shown why such things work and how everything relates to others has fundamentally changed my approach in learning my degree. Actively knowing that putting in effort in certain techniques taught here will improve the learning of the degree; and seeing the difference already in my grades and mood wasn't something I was expecting. The best part was of talking procrastination, where I knew of the pormodoro technique but it never worked due to not being able to spot the cues of procrastination. By simply saying that's cue, back to work. I can pull 8 hour days and complete all my assignments without feeling like I've killed myself . If anything I can contribute my degree to is this. No longer am I just passing, I'm actually doing well.Thank you ",0,0,James Leigh,61769464

This insightful course has taught me why and will help me see learning in a different perspective by debunking. Concepts of Chunking, Illusion of Competence, Recall & reward, diffused and focussed modes, zombies, metaphors & analogy etc., not only helps you learn but practicing them often with yourself and teaching them to others will be rewarding. The best outcome however I want to take from this course is stopping my procastination while multitasking is required.For learners - watch out for the additional interviews after every week's main content.

65500398~COURSE!~GdeNrll1EeSROyIACtiVvg,1600685153458,5,0,"I thought this was an absolutely great course and I am so glad I took it. For me, multiple choice tests, problem sets and expository rather than analytic term papers were the norm. These examination procedures are relatively objective ways to evaluate learning. In addition, as US students, we were sometimes also expected to make oral presentations. By the way, the oral presentations of Oakley and Sejnowski were superb. When I asked my English students to come to class with an oral presentation, they addressed whatever objections or fears that they may have had, by not coming class on the day given -  they knew their grade was based solely on one essay written at home and one essay written under exam conditions. Anyway, from having studied and taught in England, my experience has been that multiple choice tests are derided, and hardly used at all for more advanced students. Being able to write an essay about something is valued or evaluated. I have taught courses where there was an essay for the exam and an essay for the term project, and that was it.  To me, essays are certainly useful, and I wish that I was better at writing them myself. The drawbacks are at least two. 1) Valuing essays alone tends to favor those who can make something sound good rather than those who might have a superior understanding of a subject. This has a less than salutary effect on political discourse, among other things, not that we are doing better in the US at the moment. It favours those who sound clever rather than those who actually are clever. 2) It means that students can sometimes strategize - they may know they only have to answer 2 essay questions about two subjects out of  five subjects for example, so they may not bother to learn 3/5 of the material, and there is no way to tell whether they have as much knowledge about the other subjects as about the one they wrote about in their essay.""The Learning How to Learn"" Coursera course would help any student to understand the material that they would have to write about either quickly or in a more considered way, but it leaves out the whole question (nearly) of how to get better at writing about what you have learned. This is not exactly a criticism of the course. You are likely to have heard of this tendency to value essay writing above all else in the British system. That ""Learning"" means different things in different places is hardly an earth-shaking conclusion but I thought I would mention it.Thank you very much for the course. It was completely fantastic and I am so glad that a friend recommended it to me.",0,0,L Kelly,65500398

It is super significant to incorporate the right techniques into learning things and understanding things or you might not learn that much at all. ANd retaining information and actually being able to recall it yourself and test yourself on it and do these other things to really know and be confident in what you're learning is also a good thing to do. This course has so many beneficial tips and the advice that they provide definitely confirms a lot of the things that I thought might be right before on instinct but didn't really know for sure and now that I have the knowledge to use all these approaches to learning properly, I feel like I can truly ace all of my classes, maximize my productivity, and hopefully use the extent of my capabilities.

Sometimes it means to leave a lecture video half way paused or even unfinished line of code but that's okay. What matters in fighting the procrastination is the focus on the process not the results. I use the breaks for stretching away from the computer.Other thing I do is to set up a day limit on a specific hour, just like Dr Barbara Oakley explains in her course. In my case it's 8pm, after that hour I stop studying even if I didn't do as many Pomodoro sessions as I planned.After a while I've noticed that I look forward those studying sessions. :) I recommend it to anyone who struggles with procrastination.

Quite a bit of what is talked here I've seen before in other places. Things such as Anki, sleeping well before a test, good eating habits and exercising (doesn't mean i applied them to my life). But it was nice to have everything put into one place. It's a way to ratify that's what i should be doing.

And there indeed were a lot of valuables knowledge to be learned here. The Pomodoro technique is something I've never heard about before, and I loved and am currently applying it.

Seeing my classmates outsmarting me in every subject had always left me wondering if I wasn't intelligent enough to grasp the concepts like others. Such things can affect you in a lot of ways for a very long period. Two of the things that affected me the most are my self-confidence and my losing interest in subjects that I really loved once upon a time. Apart from the priceless lesson that this course provides, it also helped me with those two most affected parts of my life. About this course, at first, a massive thank you to the loving instructors of this course Miss Barb Oakley and Mr.Terry Sejnowski. Like I mentioned that this is the first MOOC course that I have ever completed, I believe that it was only possible because of the passion, dedication, and care that you show about the students in every lesson of this course. I can't remember the last time when I enjoyed learning something this much as a student. Throughout the course, I could feel a sense of security and learn purely without having to compare myself with others. Even though it is an online course you both made me feel as you have got my back.

I simply loved this course! It not only made me realize a lot of the 
things I was already incorporating in my studying, but helped me pick 
and sort the effective techniques whilst introducing others. The course 
also features optional interviews which can help get insight into 
learning certain subject areas from renowned experts. I also loved how 
interactive each video is, with a small quiz or short que at the end of 
many of them. Dr. Barbara really knows how to draw the audience’s 
attention and I found myself wanting to learn more at every point. 
Thanks to Barbara Oakley and Terrence Sejnowski for this wonderful course

60742976~COURSE!~GdeNrll1EeSROyIACtiVvg,1590898253623,5,0,"  Great course, effective and efficient. They got good sources from various optional interviews which can help learners get an insight into others perspectives and experiences. The course videos themselves would not exceed a 10 minute duration making them easier to watch as nobody is really worried about the lack of time they have. The quizzes are effective and straightforward and don't really get you frustrated as some quizzes usually do. The course itself was a fun experience and can be done in a short time period, even though it says 4 week duration on the course one can even possibly finish it in 4-5 days. I myself finished the course before the four week deadline. The fact that it is a self-paced course not only benefits you as you don't have to stress about any course deadlines, timings, etc. it also helps you to manage yourself and your time in a more effective manner and it's a good way to keep yourself busy whenever you have nothing else going on. It's also a good way to learn something if you have a general thirst for knowledge.  ",0,1,M H,60742976

I recommend this course to everyone who want a better learning approach. This course is a good start to know about learning.

a Quick summery for the course:

1- It's important to know you need to study and rest. It's like exercising, You need to work, but you need to rest to let your body build the muscles.

2- You need to get the big idea of what you are learning before diving into deep details. It makes getting the idea easier.

3- Procrastination is a tough problem for learners, but you will be shocked of how easy it's to tackle it.

4- It's important to know how the brain works

5- some people are talented. others need to work harder, but that doesn't mean they are worse. If they worked harder, they will show you their true potential. Example: People with ADHD, They have to work harder to grasp the information, but once they understand it, they will be creative with it.

I wish my review was helpful.

The experience and knowledge of the instructor's Dr. Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowski coupled with the outline, presentation and video helps (if I may use the language of the course) in interleaving seemingly related and different ideas (using metaphors and analogies) through out this course.  How many things we take for granted? - movements, seeing, hearing, even blinking etc. The enigmatic power of the brain to process so many details within minutes, the power of your thoughts to change your person. Concept mapping, chunking, Procrastination and the Pomodoro technique (this I think we all do without realising there is actually techniques it, cues to procrastination etc.  There is just so much to learn in this short course than can be explained.

project you try to tackle. Mostly, they emphasize the benefits of learning,
having fun acquiring new knowledge and shows you how you can motivate yourself
to learn. However, they also reassure you to not be too hard on yourself, to
keep practising with the beneficial methods and of course being real with yourself
about your progress. It was a refreshing perspective into an academic world
that is sadly and to our detriment still more focused on achievement than on
acquiring deep and meaningful knowledge. Therefore I really have to say: Great

I've enjoyed the course and completed the 4 weeks in 1 week.  Also enjoyed reading and watching the optional videos and articles.  The stories and concepts are inspiring.  It goes to show anyone can learn if given the right techniques to learn and if the person is motivated and commited.  We are home during this covid-19 pandemic so it's been tough juggling computer time to do things but I managed to do so and if I can do it, so can you.  I did at night and early morning to give everyone a chance and when the family was taking a break for lunch, I grabbed the laptop to do optional readings and videos.  The quizzes were fine and the final test was good.  I enjoyed doing the week 3 project.  I haven't received a grade on the project but I did grade and provided feedback to my peers who completed the projects.  I took the oneline course at coursera for free so I did not pay for it nor have a certification for it.  I did get 100's and 89's on the quizzes and tests and on the final got a 92%.  My point is if you plan to further yourself, it's a good idea to take this course with the expectation that you are paying for it and the professors expect only your best performance.  It's your future and your life, learning how to learn will change some things in you.  Best wishes and thank you to my two professors - it was a pleasure!  -Miguel  ",0,0,Miguel,59165436

Reasons that I like the course:
: 1- It is quite practical and useful, very applicable in all sorts of areas. 2- Ir presents new information (and I'm not a stranger to the field) and evidence/sources. 3- It gives examples and demonstrations (esp. visual) to help clarify the concepts 4- Mixes between the personal aspect of having an instructor and the value/engagement  of  displaying images and such from the web.

Reasons that I chose the course to begin with:
The topic itself is very important, especially because it can optimize all your work (make it exponential, ya3ni if you learn faster by 2X for example, you'd have a very positive impact in your professional development and such). I was searching for the topic ""learning how to learn"" and this was one of the few courses with this title. Plus, the credibility of the instructors (e.g. Mcamaster university) and the fact that it has discussion forums   

Weakness: 
 I have to say that their visual/audio effects are quite lame and it's a  bit  crude مشرتح but I don't care much for the aesthetic sides of things so it suits me well. The content is great.  ",0,0,Hashem ElAssad,46749713

After finishing that course I can say that it is quite useful. If you 
are not a biologist you can learn some new things about the structure of
 our brain and how it works. If you are a biologist, you can refresh 
that material :)

Although I had known a lot of things that were mentioned in that course,
 I could look at them from the other side due to teacher's explanations 
and my own insides. 

Also that course helped me to structure all that mental tools and gave 
new knowledge. Moreover, I noticed that I began to really USE a big 
amount of the methods for better learning. 

The atmosphere is great there. I got a lot of possitive emotions. 
Teachers show you how to use different tools with examples. What's more,
 they use that tips to make their own videos. If you notice that, you 
have even more examples and you can feel how it actually works.

So, I recommend you that course, especially, if you want to become a little bit better version of yourself.

learning, but enjoying it.

This course does a very good job mixing theoretical explanations with 
practical tips and advices to improve your learning.  However, don't 
expect magic here, there are no shortcuts. You have to be willing to put
 the effort into the material you want to learn.

The beginning of the course might seem a little bit simple, but the last
 weeks are really worthwhile. Specially if you are taking a degree of a 
very complex subject like Physics, Engineering or Math, where the focus 
mode of the brain is encouraged and the diffused mode is forgotten, 
albeit it is  much needed too.

Al thing considered, either if you are an unquiet person, who likes to 
learn constantly, or you simply want to learn how to improve your

          This is really a best course if you are wishing how to learn! I
 was blocked in many new themes that I was trying to learn and I was 
giving up on many of them because I really didn't  know that I was 
trying by the wrong method!

I'm surprised how most of themes that I'm trying again are flowing well 
after applying some of techniques learned here. The course is very well 
structured and the empathy of the authors makes you learn like you were 
in a class with the best teachers. The bottom of each chapter presents 
links to videos and texts that worth to explore! 

I bought the book ""A Mind for Numbers"" and I have started to read it ...
 it's great and I'm loving! It's wonderful like the course and also a 
great review with the pleasure of touching real paper pages.

It directly addresses the common fears everyone faces and gives you tools on how to address those fears.Some very high-level takeaways are as follows: Exercise helps you learn better, Switch between focussed and diffused (relaxed, leisurely mood) to maximize your learning potential, getting a good night's sleep is very important, deal with procrastination right-away, don't get disheartened if you don't learn something in the first go...get away, try to recall and get back to it., don't keep hammering at something which is frustrating...get back to it later, repetition is key to acquiring new skills and getting better at it, but do repetition regularly over several days and months, testing frequently your new skills is key to acquire those skills, skipping back and forth might be a good idea to solve a bigger problem consisting of many smaller problems, and many more tips and ideas.

The material is easy to digest, presented in an engaging format and there is a lot of room to grow. While most first year teaching courses focus on teaching students theoretical applications of learning, this course is focused on teaching each participant how to identify their own learning strengths and how to work on their learning difficulties.Both of the presenters are engaging, although Barbara did a much better job of connecting with the audience than Terry. The featured guest talks should really be mandatory as the information presented by the guest helped to bolster the topics covered in the course.All in all I will definitely recommend this course to anyone who is learning anything ever!

Though I didn't do it deliberately, I think it is better to complete it this way, slowly letting the lessons sink in, instead of finishing in one go. The content delivered is pretty simple but it is something which every person needs to know since improving ourselves is essential for improving our society and these basic lessons can help you learn ANYTHING faster and more thoroughly. The reason this course is so awesome is that deals with a bottleneck in the current generation's personal development process - ie. they know very little about how to learn effectively, and this course deals with it pretty well.Everyone should start this course, and there is a pretty decent chance that with a little drive you'll be able to complete it.Happy learning!

This is an amazing MOOC! 

Although there weren't any ""discoveries of the century"" for me, and most
 of the techniques that are covered in this course I suspected to exist 
or intuitive (kinda) ""knew of"", this course makes it real easy to see 
these techniques, use them to your advantage, and as a result - improve 
your learning and life in general.

By using some of the techniques from this course right from the moment I
 learned them, I moved more easily throughout the course itself, so its 
pretty much self-solving thing!) You just need to start, and then with 
every turn of the wheel it gets easier and more interesting.

Huge thanks to Barbara Oakley and Dr. Terrence Sejnowsky for creating 
this MOOC and helping people from around the world to learn how to 
learn!)

overcome difficulties in learning, such as procrastination, taking exams and
revision, etc. I found that the short videos provided by Dr Oakley are very
convincing! You can read more as a reference list is provided at the end of the
video as well. The coverage of the material is also broad, I think everybody
can try to practice these techniques mentioned when they are studying as well. I also
appreciate the optional content embedded in the course as well. They include
interviews (one from professor Keith Devlin, the instructor of “Introduction to
Mathematical Thinking” as well!), and 2 further writing peer-reviewed
assignment. I think these contents are what made the course so good, it
provides you with a chance to produce a project (a poster, a presentation, or
even a song!) to showcase and summarize what you had learnt during the 4-week
course. During the production of the project, I feel like the values taught in
the class is more thoroughly embedded in my mind. Overall,

There are also tons of tips and suggestions in preparing for tests, acquiring new knowledge and retaining information.

It opens many doors in our life when we know how our brain works, at least we can understand why we have certain kind of feeling. As sometimes we can't understand why we have feeling of discomfort, but it is the brain's signal coming from the subconcious that you have messed up something and now you have to look up where you've goofed up and make it correct. What I have learned is that pain is incredibly powerful tool created by nature. I mean how can know if something bad happened to you if there's no pain(both physical and mental). It's a nature's way of grabing your attention to address that problem so now and next time you be careful and not repeat that mistake. Pain, anger and frustration are really powerful feelings that can do wonders in our life if you acknowledge their existence. It is the path towards the truth. Just like in one of the optional interview we've seen the pain of his grandmother's death due to Alzheimer motivated Nelson Dellis to become memory champion. This course is also helpful for the people who are dealing with Depression, Social Anxiety, PTSD, chronic fear and much more because when they are dealing with those problems it creates a lots of confusion as to why they have certain kind of feeling.Internet is such an incredibly powerful tool if it is used smartly.

Gorgeous material, which is from my point of view extremely powerful, 
valuable, as well as very hands-on oriented. I have liked the way very 
much, how the material is presented and how nice the key ideas are 
educated in an easy to remember way. 

Already during the course I practiced a lot of it in real life, e.g. the
 memory palace technique to visually deposit items I want to remember. 
Btw and to be honest, w/o the examples in the videos I wouldn't even 
have dared to be that freaky, funny and evocative with my own memory 
images on such  ;) 

The only pity thought coming up into my mind is, that I should have had 
this knowledge 20 years earlier !  Anyhow, happy event never comes too 
late. I now switch back to master tough subjects of AI Artificial 
Intelligence, which is currently part of my lifelong learning, and where
 I made a little step from to the Learning How to Learn course. I'm 
sure, I speed there up tremendously.

Thanks so much to Barb Oakley, Terry Sejnowski, and the Learning How to Learn Team.

In spite of the fact that there rarely was a totally new method I got to know, it was great to see all the brilliant ideas in one place with supportive references so I don't need to worry about false myths and unreasonable remedies.The lecture is about learning, and the best point of this lecture is that it is about not only 'study' itself but also things for a better study such as preventing procrastination and test-taking tips. Dr. Barbara also gives you some mindful advice for learning to help you not to be afraid of taking a new step and not to judge your own ability and give up too early and too easily. Personally, I do not like most of the self-help books which point out all the problem could be changed if you think differently. However, her lecture was a bit different since she actually helps you find a better perspective on your problem and let you know it is not only you who have the same problem and it is able to be solved.You could finish this course without paying option and there are honour contents that will give you further understanding and extra recognition for the course.

I'd recommend this to anyone who wants to get out of a rut, who feels anxious in subjects, who can't focus even in study environment, who finds it difficult to grasp certain subjects/ topics. This course would be perfect for you. Good luck!",0,0,prashanna kumar,44010343

It made me believe that I can do much more about learning, helped me not to give up when I was about to drop out of my English classes. I've learned that when you struggle with a new concept, you just need to approach it from a new angle to make understanding smoother. And it's very important to let your brain have a rest from time to time. Thanks for teaching me how to learn.  ",0,0,Tatyana Netova,44265954

loads of articles about productivity you might have kinda mess in the head
about putting all the information in the right order. There are so many of them
and you are, reasonably, could get lost in it! Lucky me, I’ve tried the course and now, finally, the general
picture of how to be more productive become clearer to me.Here are some main reasons why you need to try the course
(whatever you feeling confident in learning or not):1. First of all, it is all about how closely
connected neuroscience and learning (+other life aspects) – everything has
scientific proof of why is it reasonable to act this way not the other one. And
yet it’s not a dogma (because loads of things we need to discover so far), but the
ideas and techniques which were presented in the course are really reasonable
and perspective.2. The second important reason why it is a great
idea to enroll the course – is about concepts and ideas of how to deal with
procrastination – the boss-devil of nowadays, I might say.3. Also I really enjoy the way of simplicity and
openness of how Barb presented every piece of information adding examples and
being funny (but concrete!) all the time.I’m not putting a big review in here but saying what I found
the most useful for me from the course. So try the course and share your own
thoughts about it! I’m sure you will not regret it :)Good luck to all and happy learning! :)

I loved the short lessons that I could listen to or read in my own time and I loved Barbara Oakley's soft voice explaining the subject in such detail and very often with metaphors.

I started Engineering recently, and since it's (in Canadian schools)  quite a math-intensive and very rigorous program, Learning how to Learn  seemed like a must-do while I'm not neck-deep in exams and homework.   As a current student, and as a learner, this course is definitely  something that anyone should do if they want to improve their long-term  memory and reduce their time spent on studying to assimilate the same  amount of information.   In my honest opinion, one of the best parts of this course is that you  can easily follow it while on transit. For my part, I would download a  week's lessons at a time and listen to them while walking to the bus and  while riding it. Of course, I missed some information by not using my  focused attention so much, but I had time to do my homework at home and  learn how to learn elsewhere.

This course is for people who lack the correct learning techniques and habits. Not everyone can force their way through university by sheer brain power - some have more and some have less of it. Understanding how your brain works and how to feed it information the right way, when to give it a rest and which kind of rest, how to leverage your diffused mode of thinking and even how to approach an exam - these are all skills that will help you achieve more, while staying focused and energized.Even if you're busy, this course is well worth your time, and pretty much all of it can be learned without even looking at the screen, so just download the course and listen to it during your commute or your jogging.

It is with this knowledge that I can surely recommend anyone to take their course Learning How to Learn. They went through the length of making an easy to follow program capable of teaching anyone in any language more about the process of learning and how to become better at it via practice.
Do away with all preconceived notions of not being smart enough or believing someone is simply born gifted. This course will break those ideas in order to expose the truth - that our brain's intelligence and cognitive abilities are much like any other muscle, thus, it can be strengthened via disciplined training and practice.

40116713~COURSE!~GdeNrll1EeSROyIACtiVvg,1566653530980,5,0,"This is the
first real elaborated review I´ve done in my life. That´s the kind of impact
this course can produce. I felt like I wanted to express my opinion about it
and my gratitude. If you are someone who likes learning or teaching, or need to
perform those activities in your everyday life for any reason, then you should
take this course without hesitation. The information given is so valuable and
eye opening. I personally like to read a lot and gain new knowledge about
anything, but I always had that little feeling that I was not being truly
efficient in doing it, that I was doing something wrong or, going further, that
I wasn´t capable or smart enough to retain the information I was trying to
learn, because I usually found myself investing a lot of time reading over and
over again a material to realize, weeks later, that I had forgotten almost all
of it. That, of course, caused me a lot of frustration. I used to feel that I
was wasting my time. I knew that the best way to learn something was trough
practice, but this course helped me understand how the process of learning
really works, the correct way of practicing and the mistakes people usually
make (illusions of learning).I had read years
ago a book about memory and memorization (Una Mente Prodigiosa by Ramón
Campayo), originally written in spanish (I´m a native spanish speaker), which
gave me a lot of insights and tools for memorizing better, but I never applied
it to my learning process. This course has filled the gap between memorizing
and learning, the missing piece that I needed to complete the puzzle. The tools
mentioned in that book are also mentioned here, but joined together with the
process of learning subjects completely, with understanding, creativity,
flexibility, associations and long term memorization.I have used the
tools given in this course to learn and memorize the course itself, and they
have been truly effective. I have also used them in studying in my own area of
work, which is mechanical engineering, and also have proven to be quite useful.
I now feel that the information stay in my mind for longer, which helps to
understand new and more complex concepts better. Of course, memorizing is not
learning, real learning comprises a lot of other things, but it´s a very
important part of the learning process. If you can´t remember the material,
then you can´t use the information to solve anything, to learn new things or to
use the information creatively. I also play the
piano, and I have even used some of the information while practicing and
learning new songs. This demonstrates that the concepts of the course can be
used in any field, as long as you´re learning something.Another
important and pleasant aspect of this course, is the way Dr. Barbara Oakley
presents the material. She is so kind and friendly, which gives you the
sensation that you are listening to a close friend or someone that you´ve known
for a long time. That makes the course material more accessible and enjoyable.
Dr. Terry Sejnowski also does a very good job at teaching. They´re just so easy
to hear. The material is very clear and well organized.I will say like
Dr. Barbara says very often: I can´t thank you both enough for this course. I´m
really grateful. Learning is a lifelong process, and that´s where the
importance of this course lies.",0,0,Ali Augusto Pacheco Becerra,40116713
