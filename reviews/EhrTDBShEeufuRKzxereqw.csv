I have been a life long student of education and psychology mostly centered in the arts. We have been engaging in these discussions and topics as arts educators for a long time but without the clarity and direction that this course brings the topic. Finally I feel like there is common language to discuss emoting AND its relevance to the field of education is much more clear and practical - Words that are not commonly connected with a more ""subjective"" field! Thank you to everyone out there studying social emotional best practices and innovating in this field.

One example of many when a child has a behavior and is acting out throwing things, we are quick to label ""Mad"" instead we should recognize. ""Behavior doesn't equal emotion"".  When you label the emotion for someone, it is confusing to them and boxes them into something you have labeled them as.  Remember their limitations and we are still learning a new vocabulary of words our self.  The videos were just enough time, and reflecting our thoughts helped to recognize how, ""maybe you are an emotional scientist"" This program was done in a way that if you follow it through, you will take something from it, and grow in a positive direction along with helping those that are struggling with their emotions and feelings.Thank you for giving me this opportunity to learn Managing Emotions in times of Uncertainty & Stress.

Who knows what 2021 will bring. If we all remember that each one of us responds differently to any given situation and that none of these reactions are right or wrong but just the way you are able to deal with it. All need to show respect for the others. I believe in the face of adversity we as a school community have been drawn closer together. The teachers are doing an amazing job with the hybrid model of learning and teaching opt out students at the same time. It reminds me of the saying ""if you want something done, ask a busy person""  GREAT JOB, REALLY ENJOYED THE COURSE",0,3,Nicola Susan Allen,78121653
