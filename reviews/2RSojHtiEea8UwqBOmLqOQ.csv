43321034~COURSE!~2RSojHtiEea8UwqBOmLqOQ,1568079328733,1,0,"In general this course was okay. The video lessons seemed to go way too fast and on this course, as opposed to the Foundations course, I really struggled to get peer reviews/fair peer reviews. Also, the level of engagement by other users was dramatically lower. I saw no responses in the forums, it was hard to peer review, and despite my many pleas for assistance, I could not find people to review my assignments. The content was still good and the structure was generally okay. I also reported an error in one of the quizzes and the response did not address my concern. I also reported a bogus peer review and the response was completely useless. Peer Review assignments will lead to my abandoning this certificate course. ",0,1,steve Whitson,43321034

8453976~COURSE!~2RSojHtiEea8UwqBOmLqOQ,1661043568185,3,0,"This course offers a reasonable introduction to annual giving campaigns. The content has not been updated in several years so the articles and studies referenced are at least five years old. The concepts, however, remain relevant and the principles and foundations of fundraising remain valid.  The assignment instructions are a bit confusing; I found in completing the peer reviews that some students misunderstood what was being requested. ",0,0,Maryanne McGlothlin,8453976
5303705~COURSE!~2RSojHtiEea8UwqBOmLqOQ,1611598896099,3,0,"This course is just ok. There is a lot of content but I really wish they would have included more visual examples/samples in the lessons and especially for the graded assignments. Many times I found the directions unclear and there was no one I could ask/no sample to view. It wasn't until after I submitted assignments and was able to view others' assignments that I realized I may have not understood the instrutions. Also, I'm still waiting on a grade for one of my assignments, and participation from other learners seems low.",0,1,Michelle Wakabayashi,5303705
38412012~COURSE!~2RSojHtiEea8UwqBOmLqOQ,1586369791222,3,0,"This course provided me with a very good understanding of how annual campaigns work. There was a great deal of information to absorb, and the reasons I don't give it five stars are two - (1) one of the presenters spoke too quickly and (2) it took three months to get sufficient reviews of my final project.",0,1,Melissa Weisstuch,38412012
22668556~COURSE!~2RSojHtiEea8UwqBOmLqOQ,1575325324910,3,0,"Content is excellent.  If the assessments matched them, I would give this course a 5.  Unfortunately, the pedagogy and attention to detail of the assignments is poor.  For example, one assignment was mis-interpreted by multiple students, indicating a lack of clarity in the directions.  Another said there were five parts, but when time to turn in the assignment there were seven parts required.  It's not bad, just frustrating.  Also, since there is no ""teacher"" and all assignments are graded by others in the course, it is a case of the blind leading the blind.  Most people give high grades, but don't give much actionable feedback.  Also, since no one grading is an expert, I wasn't sure if what I was doing was ""good"" or just fit the rubric.  I guess I'll find out when I get a job!",0,1,Sidney Werkman,22668556
