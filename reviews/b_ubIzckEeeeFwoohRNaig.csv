It is important to have the slides along what he's saying. Also, some of the material in his long lectures are not covered but then included in the reading. For an intro course this should be corrected. He needs to introduce all important concepts that will appear in the quiz.

The one thing I really didn't like about this course was He haven't provide lots of challenges and the depth of the topics are so shallow, so an intermediate student might be bored especially in weeks 2 up to week 5, but it had the quality of having both a great beginning and an inspiring ending. I, myself, can't wait to deep diver into the advanced topics he discussed by the end of the course. Thanks Dr. Abdey, and Coursera. ",0,0,Ashkan Ranjbar,54557230

Moreover, the connections between the related concepts, statistical techniques and the real-world scenarios are presented more than successfully.Though the course may have been designed as introductory and it might not be feasible to present the abstract part of the subject in greater detail given the duration, I would still like to suggest that more theoretical aspects of the subject be exposed if possible.
