I especially loved the course content, which was both clear and thorough, as well as the coaching framework that helped zoom the topic out from technical skills to really thinking about my values and what it would take to live a coherent life.  I've already recommended this course to my communities and highly encourage it to anyone who is wanting greater clarity and insight into what it might take to search for a job that fits their values more.  THANK YOU REMY! So grateful for the time and energy you took to create this course.",0,0,Miyuki Baker,115763471
