The slides are too poor and it looks that the slides are drawn for tutor but not for students. But for whom the course is implemented: for students or  tutor? I am sure that for students. Most of slides are not informative. In many cases it was necessary to re-listen to the part of lecture to find an answer for the tested question. Is it a some kind of English listening test, quick guide to the Principles of Secure Coding or a tool to earn money by coursera via waste of time? For me, I am sure that it is not a quick guide.

However, there are 2 things that really annoyed me:
* Videos feel unprepared. The lecturor often doesn't advance the presentation in time and describes the information that is written in the next or previous slide.*​ Too much focus on C implementation of an example library and, as a result, too much focus on C-related problems and workarounds. Literally, all the problems in the example library are there because of the inability to have private members in C. Take C++, Java, Python, whatever - and all the problems are solved.

A lot of the content seemed theoretical. While it's realistic to, 'program defensively', the content really doesn't hit home unless you're able to demonstrate exploitation. Modern day attacks are based around APIs and Stacks and while the material is  more relevant to the C or C++ programmer, it would of been good to actually see the attacks talked about executed. We all know we have to program robustly or defensively, but show us what could happen if we don't. Sure smashing the stack for fun and profit is a great read, but try modernizing your content for the relevant generation taking the course on this platform.

Good info in general; will make you think critically about how you design and implement software solutions to various problems. Good breadth and depth in the examples (though the code formatting in the slides could be improved...). The C programming examples are good for this kind of course, since C is a notoriously insecure language. That said, some examples in a more modern language would be useful since code security issues are prevalent in all languages. Python/Javascript would be great, or at least an interpreted language, with some jupyter notebook incorporation for the examples.

58737787~COURSE!~MxUmEBtIEemj1w6Mo8vnSg,1588236420504,4,0,"The information presented was overall good and entertainingly presented. The material itself was a bit C-centric and UNIX-centric, and assumed a lot of background knowledge about C and operating system design. It would have been better to actually explain the necessary background rather than assuming that the listener already knew it. I can imagine some students (especially those that don't know C or UNIX administration) being quite confused and frustrated. Also, some of the code examples given were needlessly complex, and I think the time spent explaining them in detail could have been better used covering other topics.The quizzes were sometimes quite frustrating, not so much because the information that they were testing was difficult, but because many of these questions were quite misleading due to poor, ambiguous or imprecise phrasing of questions and answers. I wouldn't have worried about this much except for Coursera's annoying 2-time limit for quiz retakes before a mandatory 8-hour wait. In some cases, having more knowledge actually made it harder to answer these questions correctly, since knowing that the ""correct"" answer was technically wrong and thus hard to distinguish from ""wrong"" answers could be a hindrance.With these concerns noted, I did find the course valuable, and I think many people will learn useful skills from it.",0,4,Derek Foster,58737787
