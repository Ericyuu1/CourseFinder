2953243~COURSE!~3j4pqbsSEeayqhK4SOTn7g,1501540678938,2,0,"Some of the speakers are OK, and interesting to listen to. However, many speakers were not good speakers, with lots of ""likes"" and ""ums"" in their talks. Also, the video edits often cut people off in the middle of sentences.  There were far too many supplemental materials to read for my liking. Also, to be perfectly honest I think this course brought up more questions than it answered and does not improve understanding or approval of transgendered or gender non-conforming individuals.",0,1,Jacqueline Steinhauer,2953243
11697062~COURSE!~3j4pqbsSEeayqhK4SOTn7g,1673291570872,3,0,"I am really liking the course. The reason for my low rating is the very large number of broken links in the course (at a guess, around 12-15). I found so many that it got tiresome. I reported some broken links via the reporting button to assist course editors, but then it seemed to mess up my progress as if I hadn't read/viewed the links (I searched them and was able to fond some of them this way), so I stopped reporting them. Disappointing. What I loved were the vast range of opinions, experiences and faces of gender non-conformity issues. I feel my understanding has grown greatly.",0,0,Rachel MacNally,11697062

A nice mixture of videos and readings covering many different areas impacting the TGNC community. I have gathered a collection of books that I'd like to read and movies that I'd like to watch to continue my learning. Having a final assignment that was peer graded seemed ridiculous, but I did it, put some thought into it and was given a 3/7, therefore not passing and having to resubmit it. No other CEUs that I have taken in the past 10 years have included anything like. It was so frustrating after putting 30 or so hours into this course to have a peer decide my final assignment wasn't worth passing, especially after the assignment description begins with ""there are no right or wrong answers"".",0,2,Sara Carlson,72950745

I thank you all for instructing me about how to help transgender people, in a country like mine, where even ignorance and prejudice hurt a lot. From my trench as a university professor, I want to make a commitment to support transgender people and their families with the aim of restarting a healthy and emotional communication, which stimulates their self-esteem and allows them to fully develop in their social environment to improve their quality of life .
