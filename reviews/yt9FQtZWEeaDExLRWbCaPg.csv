30593946~COURSE!~yt9FQtZWEeaDExLRWbCaPg,1513581307465,2,0,"Fantastic line up of presenters who are expert, passionate and knowledgeable about their work. In some cases they are also elegant presenters. However, the instructional design, translation of written text, and structure of assessment items was very poor and let the presenters down. The course doesn't explore ethical frameworks of violence/ violence management per se, but is more specifically concerned with interpretation of specific laws (namely humanitarian and human rights law) in conflict zones. Equally, the course is not about health care broadly, but all examples deal with provision of emergency and acute care hospital scenarios, plus an almost incomprehensible unit on the basics of military operation and how to bomb hospitals legally. If you work in other health contexts - e.g. food security, primary health care, trauma recovery - there are no opportunities to adapt the materials to your own contexts.  All in all, this was a disappointing production of a course that should have had much more going for it given the expertise of the presenters. Renaming the course, fixing translation and ensuring assessment reflects some basic standards would do much to improve it. ",0,1,Mary Alice Campbell,30593946
