I've noticed a data science issue that seems to be 'skirted around'....that is understanding the actual data and how it is created.  I work in a health care organization.  Our Epidemiologists are 'quasi-data scientists' however, their main strength is data analysis and presentation.  We have one research database that is well documented and uses world wide standards....this doesn't cause any challenges.  However, our clinical system is a transactional database that is used for managing patient appointments, treatments, and their electronic chart.  There are two challenges....first, the epidemiologists have very little understanding of the process and business rules that are used for entering data and they have a reluctance to dig out that information.  This is a big issue for them because when they approach data engineers to provide them with data they don't understand the 'business' issues associated with that data and therefore there requests are often not meaningful.   An intermediary of some sort is needed to help the epidemiologists understand what they are asking for and what problems they will encounter with the data.   The second, somewhat lesser problem is that the the clinical management system database is in no way optomized for data extraction.  It's a transactional database with hundreds of tables and therefore is not directly usable by an epidemiologist.   We have dedicated data engineers who extract data from this database.   I think there is a gap in our organization between the Epidemiologists who are statisticians and the data engineers ...... this gap is my concern.  ",0,0,Don Roszell,47429835

 · 7 days ago · EditedFirst of all.....these guys running this data science department have their hands full. They are teaching live classes for students who have spent OODLES (lots) of money to attend this prestigious college . Johns Hopkins is about as good as it gets for a medical degree. Then they are doing experiments and other data science for the research division of Johns Hopkins which is also as good as it gets........THEN they are doing these MOOC courses on top of all their other responsibilities......Dr. Leek is a University of Washington Alumni, which is also top notch for Data Science.The video lesson is flawed, there is no denying it. But I must say these teachers are very open to improvement in the course and your comments on what could be better done are received and acted upon, so I would include them in your thank you letter to the teachers.ALSO I think these MOOC courses are best done by all members of the department contributing. Truly this field IS a team sport. I feel this course was good, but the videos need to be edited and scripted, so unnecessary language, which dilutes the core knowledge, that must be learned, is not diluted where questions are left in the students head about content when being tested. I learned long ago in a college calculus class that if your mark isn't perfect, it's OK, so long as you pass with a high score......even if it is the teachers fault. The course could use better video production with teleprompter scripting......maybe some AV students at Johns Hopkins could get on board. it will happen eventually I'm sure.You want to take a course that is absolutely one of the best courses I've taken anywhere and truly the best online. Try the number one business course on Coursera:GROW TO GREATNESS, either part 1 or 2, University of Virginia, Darden School Of Business...........A team created course with one helluva a teacher who is a business person, researcher and award-winning writer. I would recommend this course to ANY student and especially E-Teachers.The problem with this course is that there is a lot of information that can be included but may not be absolutely necessary as a ""core concept"". Needless to say, the more technical skills any employee has, the more insight they will have into their teammate's skills, as well, as the overall mission of the data department and the business it serves. I'm more of a tech and infrastructure person, I'm not real passionate about coding. I find it tedious. The more I learn about it, the more I enjoy it, albeit, from a distance. I can't see myself creating great blocks of scripts, but the more I know about how they are created AND what rules the code in a project must abide by, the better my skills will be as a data center manager. So I'm trying to learn as much as possible about R, Python, and companion programs like ggvis for creating visualizations. I'd say visualizations are an essential skill for a data manager, since you have to present results and projects, questions, and answers to higher ups and other departments.this link comes from the resource section of this course:https://www.datacamp.com/courses/ggvis-data-visualization-r-tutorialThis link or URL is of much more value to me, than a flawed test question and a reduction in my 100 percent average in the specialization.Without this lesson, in this course, I would not have this valuable resource.Another great link, which has a great FREE print publication as well:http://www.processor.com/ ...these people have been advising data center managers longer than just about anybody !Verbally and in the transcript are some nebulous statements that point toward the main idea, that concept being: the more any employee, on any data science or technical team member IS, a ""jack of all trades"", the better. So that could have been included in some more general way on the quiz, because really that is pretty much a general rule, I've found, working in ANY capacity in the tech industry. I have done a great deal of audio editing, working at numerous radio stations, with Adobe Audition. With others like: Pro Tools, or any other really good quality AV digital editor the result is streamlined, near seamless, audio-video, or one or the other. You just learn how to read and edit wave forms of all kinds.Years ago, in Dallas, Texas, attending Richland College. I learned a valuable lesson. I was taking a college level Calc-Trig math class being taught by the regular professor's WIFE. I don't know if the professor was sick, but this woman, who was teaching the class for the whole semester, frankly, was not qualified. I had always been considered an illiterate by my high school math teachers, a married couple who, frankly, were highly abnormal even on the geekiest scale. These people were acting like they were a world above most people in the class. Needless to say, I assumed, by their ""adult"" opinions, they were sent by God Himself, to educate me thru denigration.I was amazed, how 10 years later, in College math how well I was doing. I was carrying a 100 percent average ! So midterm this faux professor declares, ""I'll be prefiguring all the arithmetic to be easy, so you won't have to bring your calculators !""SO I DIDN'T.......and of course the teacher's wife proclaims.....""I didn't have time to make the arithmetic easy so you'd better use your calculators !"" I literally had pages and pages of figuring in handwriting accompanying my 3 page test. The result was a C plus on the test. I angrily told the sub teacher ""I did not bring a calculator to this test because you said it wouldn't be necessary, therefore I must be allowed to redo this test with a calculator !"" She of course relented, ""No that won't be possible...that's not a bad grade...."" she continued, ""what are you worried about ?""........I was so peeved, I was going to drop the class. It was too late in the semester, and I was so disgusted with this woman's cavalier dismissal of my perfect grade that I just stopped going to class. The result was a failing final grade.Who ultimately suffered from this dilemma ? That, albeit, unfairly was me.....who created this ""academic"" tragedy, by the aggravation of a deeply flawed situation. Once again, that would be me.

This has been very useful to me bot as a way to get inspired on new ideas and techniques, and as a way to confirm what I am already doing. However, there were few occasions where I found the quizzes not to be clear enough. In some instances this was due to the fact that the question asked required some extra knowledge that couldn't possibly be achieved only by reading the course material or listening to the class. I was lucky I new the answers because of my personal experience but it seemed quite unfair in my opinion. Also lectures materials are very short and don;t provide any extra information.In other cases, the answers, especially when there were multiple answers didn't seem to be clear enough and sometimes contradicting what I had listened in the class. I don't remember specific cases at the moment, however I have left feedbacks throughout the course.

I am a man of 58 years old and having an experience of almost 30 years of Business Management of Pharmaceutical & Nutraceutical Industries of Pakistan. Presently I am having my own Consulting Company "" AIMMS CONSULTING"" and extending my services as Management Consultant to different companies of said sectors.
I am of the conviction that learning is never ending and have a habit of learning new ideas about my favorite subject about Data Science. Although I have the limited usage of this subject in my working areas but I love to know about new areas of different specialties.
I really appreciate highly the efforts of respected instructor and enjoyed the course material and videos presentation of this course. Mind blowing approach was adopted especially in the basic components of Building A Data Science Team Data Analysis.
SUGGESTION:
MY PERSONAL HUMBLE REQUEST, Please make also the important components of course material as a part of this Certificate with % AGGREGATE so that it has a much more worth & impact for the courses participated.
