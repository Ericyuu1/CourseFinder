46024702~COURSE!~vB3fIx1SEeu6LRJwytZjjQ,1670615779724,3,0,"1. There are no PDF slides provided to facilitate studying.2.  Much of the material provided was old, as old as 2014, as was the case for the french power mix chart. 3. Lots of repetitive info, repetitive charts, and even a whole section (Introduction to Grid Integration was delivered twice!).4. The ""Introduction to Electricity Storage"" video had a single slide for the whole duration of the video.5. No Advantages/Disadvantages were presented for Li-Ion Batteries, but they were presented for other technologies. There is a lack of objectivity here.6. When talking about thermostats the professor talked about one specific brand (Nest). This is not correct, it seemed as an advertizing. ",0,0,Juan Rodriguez,46024702

35697615~COURSE!~vB3fIx1SEeu6LRJwytZjjQ,1629989464553,4,0,"The course provides a very good introduction to the basics of the electricity market. It commendable that the course is not focused on the US market, but also analyses case studies and models from other countries, which makes the content more interesting for non-US users. I believe the same effort should be put in selecting material that is not so tightly related to the US market and institutions. The reading material is actually meant to provide information additional to the video lectures and is not required to correctly answer the exam. The exams questions are perhaps a bit too easy, but you do fail them if you do not pay attention to the video lecture.

Overall, I am satisfied with the course and would warmly suggest it to users interested in learning more about renewables and electricity markets in general.",0,2,Giulio Galdi,35697615

There is some limited of repetition of some material presented in the first course in this ""specialization"", but it does not bog down and provides useful review/reinforcement.  I also very much appreciated the breadth of the readings and the way he went back to different pages of the same documents.  It helped to reinforce points, as well as to introduce us to the wide array of quality information available.C​oursera is a great platform and we are fortunate that people like Professors Komor and Lawrence are willing to take the time to make these opportunities available.
