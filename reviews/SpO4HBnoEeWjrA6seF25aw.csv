Also, I felt that the class did not actually teach me Data Analysis USING EXCEL, it moreso tried to teach all the math behind the functions which I found a bit unnecessary because that wasn't what the quizzes would ask. The first few weeks were better, but as the course went on, the quizzes became more messy, and the videos became more math focused than Excel focused.

This would perhaps be forgivable if it were a decent math course, but that is also not the case. Lecture videos are low quality, littered with confusing errors and there is even a mistake in a graded quiz that remains uncorrected long after being brought to the attention of course staff. The final assignment is so poorly explained and confusing that extensive use of peer advice from forums is needed. It is obvious from the poor quality of this course that the instructor and staff have little respect for students' time and learning experience. Plagiarism and requests for quid-pro-quos appear to be rampant in the final assignment, and peers grade assignments incorrectly and arbitrarily even when provided answers explicitly match the criteria of the grading rubric, so expect your grade to have little connection to the correctness of your assignment or how much effort you spend on it. It's essentially a dice roll whether you receive graders capable of understanding the rubric and/or willing to take the time to accurately assess your work.

First you should know that the first week doesn´t reflect at all the rest of the course in difficulty and in matter. As I was delighted by the first week presentation and way of explaining as soon I started the second week I was wondering what happen to the clear, concise examples and ideas presented in the first one. First The presentation of the following weeks is done by handwriting on software that give a very very poor graphic view. It´s BARELY READABLE ! It allows really smalls amounts of infos to be displayed. That could be redeemed by good explanations you may say but sadly it´s not the case most of the time. The examples are rarely connected to something real, numbers come up from ... nowhere. The level of difficulty could be challenging if you don´t have a bachelor of sciences like Math or Physics or Bio. It´s NOT A BEGINNER COURSE.To give more context I have done and succeed more 16 courses , 2 specializations, followed/audited about 3 others courses and that is the first time I´m giving a bad review. I´m sure the teachers put a lot of effort in doing the course , there is a lot subjects presented but I definitely suggest a change in the presentation to start then connect and fully explain examples.

taught much like Khan Academy, on a digital blackboard. Nothing 
inherently wrong with that but when your course title has the word 
'EXCEL' in it one would reasonably expect the instructor to actually 
demonstrate using excel. Nope, not here.

If you've never heard of linear regression or Bayes Theorem don't bother with this course. Honestly. While those things may be easy to explain without the math they are very difficult concepts to implement and a simple 10 minute video won't clear the fog.You absolutely will not 'master' data analysis with this course.

If it wasn't for the TA/Mentors who do the lions share of work in the forums answering questions and deciphering the questions so students can understand them this course would be an abysmal failure. If you're wanting to jump on the data analysis/ scientist bandwagon look elsewhere. i.e. EdX has a great course on a true introduction to data analysis that is more in line with people's impression of actually using excel in that context.Now, having bashed the course I do believe the instructor to be a very competent and knowledgeable individual, but I feel he's been in academia too long and has grown accustomed to teaching those who've been in school continuously and still have algebra/ stats fresh in their minds vs. those who need to brush away the cobwebs.

- Classification lecture is good;-Weekly assignments are challenging enough
CONS
- No slides provided. Professor draws on an eletronic chalkboard (with a very bad handwriting) and you need to keep going back to videos when you are doing the homework. For me, this shows lack of professionalism and laziness
-  Some excel sheets are provided. But they are very messy and badly formatted, matching the messy handwriting in the videos. AND, the instructions are for MAC! No instructions for PC are provided whatsoever. I never used MAC, so I had a very hard time!
- Very few examples real examples are provided;
- You learn math concepts, not Excel skills! Except for the LINEST function, which is very handy, BUT it's NOT TAUGHT in the videos. I had to google the function to learn it.
- They say to complete each piece of the final assingment after you finish the respective week related to that piece. But they only say that as you start week 6!
- The course doesn't provide sufficient material for the final assignment. You get stuck without knowing how to get to answers;
- Some answers to the final assignment are not correct, you check the answer sheet, and the results aren't present in the test!
OVERALL:
I'd never recommend this course to anyone. I only took it because I'm plannening to finish the specialization. 
I've taken several Online Courses (5+ on Excel), and this is the worst and most frustating  one by far!

You therefore need to be careful when responding and choose the answer that is closest to your result.

I finished the course at 2am on Monday morning and I've been really impressed, both with the Coursera ""infrastructure"" and with the quality of the teaching from Daniel Egger and his team.  I live in South Africa where tertiary educational standards vary widely, and appear to be on the decline.  More and more, we are going to need MOOCs like this from the best universities in the world.More specifically, relating to this course, I found the video lectures well presented and the quizzes thoughtfully prepared. The Excel models really helped with grasping the concepts and practice.A couple of suggestions: a) The course FAQ makes light of the background knowledge necessary to cope with the course. It needs to be more honest about the need for mathematics and statistics. Linear regression is not for sissies, in my opinion. b) Please tell us at the START of the course that we should attack the project week by week.  This advice isn't (unless I missed something) given until you open the week 6 project.  Ahem... it's too late by then!  I spent a very frantic 4 nights last week crunching the project work, 4 quizzes and the assignment.
