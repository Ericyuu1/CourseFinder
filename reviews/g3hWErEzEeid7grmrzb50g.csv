63111315~COURSE!~g3hWErEzEeid7grmrzb50g,1592555276577,1,0,"The class itself is educational but the way the assessments are designed is quite rubbish. Written assessments are all graded by peer students which does not make a lot of sense as peer students can be highly unsure about the answer and grade whatever. It is unfair to depend on peers to grade. Personally, it is better to have multiple choice assessments than some written exams and not getting any constructive feedback from a professor, which is very useless. I do NOT recommend to buy this course. ",0,8,S. Guez,63111315

On contrary one big MINUS is that you won't get your course copmpleted as soon as you wish beacuse of Peers review assignments which is done carelessly. They just don't care what they are typing or checking so I suggest to remove this type of knowledge evaluation completely or at least reduce it to minimum and focusing more on thoroughly projecting quizzes and other types of estimations WITHOUT PEER involvement. ,0,2,Vitaliy M.,101716709
