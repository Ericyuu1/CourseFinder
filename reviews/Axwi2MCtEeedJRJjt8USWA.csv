2900231~COURSE!~Axwi2MCtEeedJRJjt8USWA,1577487337554,1,0,"The instructor begins the class with a tirade about how influencer marketing requires soft skills and creativity that can't be automated by software so that no ""push-button"" solution to influencer marketing is possible.  The trouble is, these are skills that can't easily be taught to humans either.  After working through this class, I still do not feel that I have a very good idea about how to engage influencers to come onboard my cause.  This seems to be something that can't really be taught because it is very specific to the exact situation - and worse - the solution is often innovative and surprising.  No ""push button"" solution for humans neither.  So how should one approach influencers to take on a project?  The answer seems to be to go away and think of something clever that will get their attention.  This is the part that I was really hoping to learn how to do and I got little out of this class in that regard.",0,12,Ron Benditt,2900231

I do have a few concerns, mostly technology related. There were large sections with audio glitches which I reported at the time with no acknowledgment. I recall one time when the audio did not sync with the current lesson. I suppose my other concern is that on more than one occasion during peer review I was presented with peer assignments that had nothing to do with the topic.
