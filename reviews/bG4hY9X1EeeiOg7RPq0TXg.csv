14413817~COURSE!~bG4hY9X1EeeiOg7RPq0TXg,1547592407525,2,0,"This course has an interesting content about the phenomenon of sound and the perception of it. The world moves and is happy because of the sound, but for this to have become a course, it makes people bored. somehowThe videos can easily be compiled and a documentary can be formed with all the information, starting with the concepts and then the examples and the extra videos.The evaluations are also abstract. Course is finished.",0,1,Ivonne Martinez T,14413817

2608642~COURSE!~bG4hY9X1EeeiOg7RPq0TXg,1635690823861,5,0,"I​t was an exciting time for me. This course covers amazing ground in terms of exposure to fundamentals and contemporaneous experimenters with sound. If I listened carefully to and explored the works of the sonic artists mentioned by the facilitators, I would be able to understand how the fundamentals can be used in multiple ways to create art. The exercises given were challenging but worthwhile in terms of pushing one's boundaries. I only wish there was more interactivity and discussion on the works that might have been done by the participants.",0,0,Rudra Prajapati,2608642
