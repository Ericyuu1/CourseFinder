88107380~COURSE!~zyVhVdWcEeuHZxLf1n3CGQ,1652709970446,4,0,"Nice short intro to lambda. My big bug though is that the lecturer mixes up filter out with filter onThis gets really confusing and means Quiz Q7 needs to be answered with the opposite of the correct answer.Filter out means to remove all values that meet a criteria, filter on means to keep only those values that meet the criteria.Filtering OUT evens from a series of numbers, your resluting dataset is the odd numbers. Filtering ON even numbers discards the odds and leaves you with the evens.The lecturer uses filter out when he means filter on. ",0,0,Richard Allen,88107380

It is enough to get the basics and to carry on on your own. The instructor is explaining everything in detail and there are also exercises that you can do on your own and verify the solution afterwards. I honestly recommend this project, it is ideal for beginners.",0,0,Olga Brys,94895990
