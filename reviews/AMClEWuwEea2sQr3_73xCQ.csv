The course has 3 weeks of videos where Alex basically talks about C programming for embedded Systems. And all 3 weeks you just need to answer some tests to pass. There are no labs to practice the knowledge. I did week 2 and 3 in one afternoon, literally.And the second problem is that he says it's part of an specialization that simply DOESN'T EXISTS in Coursera.So yes, there are important concepts in the course worth learning.

 course material has little to do with embedded programming and more with simple,
basic C programming. But that is not why I am not giving more stars: whenever I was trying to answer the vaguely phrased questions, I had to guess what the teacher believed was the correct answer. Based on how you interpret the questions, some of the expected answers are plain wrong. And some I cannot even understand how could be possibly correct, no matter how I am trying to interpret the questions.

5014722~COURSE!~AMClEWuwEea2sQr3_73xCQ,1579138201089,2,0,"Information was good, however, there were several problems.  First, several of the progress quizzes asked questions prior to presenting the information.  As they were just progress quizzes, this wasn't a big deal, but it should have been resolved some time ago.  Secondly, there were a few tests that contained questions on material not covered.  Even Googling for answers did not yield answers to what they were asking.  Unfortunately, there were so few questions on the test, that you could only miss one or else you would fail.  There were consistently 2-3 of the questions with unknown answers.  I ended up taking one test 7 times and only passed based on trial and error.  When complete, they present the answers (kind of pointless) and I disagree with two of them.  But who are you going to complain to?  That brings me to my next point.  This is clearly a free-running course.  None of the comments were more recent than about three weeks.  Even going back a year there were only a handful from any staff monitoring the questions.  Of course, the majority of the questions were just pleas for someone to grade their submissions.  It is unfortunate that there was no way to ask a real question and get a response from a staff member.  Finally, the programming tests were effective, but the tasking was incredibly vague.  There were bits and pieces of the tasks spread all over the assignment.  Very unorganized and it was difficult to figure out everything that was required for the assignment.",0,7,Link Panettiere,5014722

45650261~COURSE!~AMClEWuwEea2sQr3_73xCQ,1588702333288,5,0,"I wouldn't call this course Embedded SW&HW because it is more focused on software, only to rely on hardware when there is no other way of explaining things. For me, it was a valuable source of good practices and some programming hacks, but I believe it is so because I have already taken the course regarding embedded hardware. Read the reviews for other technical problems this course introduces, like not needing to buy development board and some quiz issues. All in all, for my first course on Coursera, it was a good experience.",0,1,Nikola Cvetković,45650261
