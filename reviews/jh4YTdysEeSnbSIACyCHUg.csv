109859255~COURSE!~jh4YTdysEeSnbSIACyCHUg,1661035817995,4,0,"I am happy I took this introduction course on American Law, as I got better grasp on legal fields that I never realized impacted my daily life. I always heard (from lawyer's opinions) that contract was boring by setting rules/regulations, but I come to realize it's those rules that set important boundaries and prevents unnecessary lawsuits. Though, as a consumer, I do believe the dominacy of drafting parties is unfair, as you either accept the fine print or forego the item. The Constitutional Law surprised me, realizing how much the law has changed over time, as well as the checks and balance powers has shifted, but I can apply that reasoning and notice that the modern day is not always representing that change of time. It seems the court's decisions lately are siding with their own beliefs and strictly following the Constitution, even though it is ambigious, as the founders' intentions were for the generations to choose the best fit for the current time period. Personally, I enjoyed the professors and their teaching later in the course. I believe the examples of real court cases were helpful to understanding more thoroughly. However, my most confusing parts/concepts were learning about ""pragmatism"" and ""substantivity."" I am happy I got to retake the quizzes, as I thought they were final, which allowed me to go over my missed questions and try again. I chose to take this class, because I'm hoping to pursue a career in law when I go to college/law school, and I want to help people through the application of law.

The instructors manage to make some complex ideas simple to understand while not talking down to their students. Assessments were fairly straightforward but did cover the material fairly well.The biggest weakness, in my view, was the discussion forums. As seems common in most courses on the new Coursera platform, the forums were fairly quiet. However, this was made worse by the apparent attitude of the course mentors who, whether intentionally or merely through their language limitations (neither of the most active mentors were native English speakers or US residents), seemed patronising and dismissive of entirely reasonable questions. Moreover, their input in ever thread served to stifle discussion between students; once they had given the 'correct' response any other input was entirely unwelcome. I've never come across such apparently hostile 'mentoring' either online or in the traditional academic situations. For this reason alone I rate the course at a 4 rather than 5 star. Maybe later courses will have different mentors or the existing ones will improve their skills.
