98484965~COURSE!~HcLMfb-2EeqX3BJoxwA--w,1644011222450,2,0,"I´m just in the middle of the course and I have to say I am not satisfied. Of course, I will finish the course, it´s not my style to abandon what I´ve begun, but this course has many disadvantages/mistakes.
1. the professor speaks too fast and you have to stop it every time to make notes
2. there are facts and facts only - no deep thinking needed here - the potential of university-level history is not present here.
3. the quizzes are also just about historical facts, just remembering, no thinking required.",0,0,Pavel Martinec,98484965

106557811~COURSE!~HcLMfb-2EeqX3BJoxwA--w,1652836189732,3,0,"This course was interesting but I have to take stars off because of a few matters; the pace of the voice over was fast - too fast - to fully take in everything that was being said, so each video had to be watched multiple times in order to take the quiz. However, I recognize that this is a downside to having a translation voiceover in videos that pack in as much information as these ones did. I also think the translation should be reviewed because there were a few times when what was said was clearly incorrect (such as an instance in which something was said to be millions of years old, which I can only assume was meant to be ""millenia"" instead of ""millions"" as even the conciderable span of Egyptian history is not typically measured in millions), and the information shown on the screen and what was said did not match (such as the section where the Lybian Dynasty, noted on the video as Dynasty 22, was said as Dynasty 21, and this was one of the questions on the quiz).",0,0,Rachel Price,106557811

There were also sections devoted to Tutankhamun's tomb, and the early Christian communities of Late Antiquity. I appreciated a lot the professor's clear and lucid style. The course was enriched by not only focusing on political history, but culture, architecture, religion, art, and philosophy.
