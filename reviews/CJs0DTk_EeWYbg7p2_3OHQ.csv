It covers the essentials of how to create functions and implement event handlers that react to the users, which is the most common use of JS.  As an introductory course, it correctly assumes some of its audience has no prior programming background.  However, it is difficult to teach programming in such a short time.  As an experienced programmer, I would recommend reviewing the order in which some of the concepts are presented to try to help in this aspect.I was personally hoping that the final assignment would be a bit more challenging, but it was very straightforward.  Form handling (the topic in the final week) is certainly where I've used JS the most during my career, so I was glad that it was given special attention.Again, this is a really good course for beginners; Dr. Van Lent is awesome.",0,0,Juan O.

Colleen is a great teacher, very patient, and knows how to drive the flow of knowledge as not to overwhelm students. Also, the assignments are easy enough as to not dissuade you but hard enough to challenge newcomers.The only observation would be that the syntax is the old one. JS has newer syntax since this course was developed (i guess 2015). Anyway, it is a good course as part of the series of Web Design for everybody.

You would, still, get the important bits that you would actually need for most of your frontend development. But it would be better if you actually know programming beforehand. Let me put it like this:- if you do not know any programming, this will all feel strange and you won't fell like you actually got the gest of it, BUT, you will, still, be able to do the basic things that would need for frontend development. If you know a programming language or 2, this would be really a walk in the park, and you are really here just for learning the syntax and how to connect a .js file to your HTML page.
