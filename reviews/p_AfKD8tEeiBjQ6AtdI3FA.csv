Though it may not work for someone who doesn't know much about guitar and its basic layout. Like if you don't know even the open strings and first three frets, then this is not for you.

So maybe I have missunderstood something in your course but overall I found the explanations to quick and hard to understand  and not practical to play along with other musicians. Also I am dissapointed because I have got a good feedback (accomplished and only one developing) but still missed to pass the course. I am not a beginner, I play fingerstyle and classical pieces since childhood, so I have experience in how lessons are build up.

First, there isn't as much 'connecting the dots' as I would have liked, either to general terms and concept or even to prior courses.  Thus, if you don't know what the ""flat third"" is coming in, you won't know when you leave either.  Chord progression was maybe the one area where they did connect the dots (the I IV, V chords make up a gazillion songs), but even there, they didn't explain why those chords work together so well.  Secondly, and this is only an issue for the few of us, there is no consideration for left handed guitar players.

It would better if students ability levels were assessed and graded at the beginning of the course, for example, by completing a questionnaire. This could then be used to better match student level to assessor level at the peer review stage.

The course reminded to use the metronome beats to keep the tempo, to focus on accuracy over speed (to play slow), encouraged to make mistakes. The instruction videos were clear to understand and setting week goals kept motivating to continue. It was nice to read other students comments and analyze self-progress in every week. Most rememberable were arpeggios and 12-bar blues. Also opportunity to study theory along with practice. It´s a great way to pick up the instrument and commit to practice regularly.",0,0,Tanel Viilup,50622804
