2011892~COURSE!~9WvP3evLEeWaMA7Pe7xMzw,1674488064032,4,0,"The lecturer is fantastic.  The topics covered fit the criteria. And, given the Professor's deep and broad familiarity with the field, approach a sense of conveying an intuitive understanding of the topic.  This is necessary to feel like the topic being discussed is actually useful.The main weakness in this course is the questions.  There is just a series of true and false (denoted Right and Wrong in a cute idiosyncrasy in the course) with very few problems that one has to use the information in the lecture to calculate towards an answer.  This, in general, is a weakness in a lot of Coursera courses that did not used to be present.  So I don't know how much the people who created this course are at fault.Namely, in the early days of Coursera, there used to be wide spread use of either formula or numerical input that were challenging.  Passing a test or quiz wasn't as simple as changing one's answer to another radio button or check box.  To pass, you had to use the lecture information.  Sometimes in a rote, plug and chug way.  Sometimes more involved and - when you got it - in a way that felt more like mastery.For this course, I was able to use the book that the lectures mirror.  By doing so - and using the end of chapter questions - I got a lot more out of the experience.  For someone who wants to use just this course - which is what we are all paying for - I'm worried that that person will be short-changed.Again, I'm not sure if this is due to poor course design or a new limitation imposed by Coursera.  But I hope it is addressed site wide at some point.  Basically, take this course if you want the knowledge, but seek other testing sources if you want to demonstrate - to yourself, if no one else - mastery of the subject matter.
