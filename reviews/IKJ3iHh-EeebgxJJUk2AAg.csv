Even after solving the quizzes I wasn't absolutely confident that I could repeat the results of the following in a similar circumstance. There was a lot of helper code which allowed for easier solving. I expected a tougher project. But otherwise, a well explained course, but still not a project.",0,0,SUBHADEEP SENGUPTA,57202019

25920879~COURSE!~IKJ3iHh-EeebgxJJUk2AAg,1540625590377,4,0,Really liked the course; the python code in challenges is so well commented that it helped me learn a lot of math and code. Really appreciate the challenges and visual explanation he does by drawing graphs; specially in branch and bound. Could have made video instruction a little more friendly to people with low intuitive mathematical knowledge. Left a lot of gaps to be filled by self learning efforts through Google etc; as each video had a line or two that weren't explained up to the mark. I do take a lot of online courses on Udemy and I do love learning by myself and facing challenges; however I also really like when course instructors provide me clear and rock solid fundamental knowledge.,0,1,Aviral Kulshreshtha,25920879

To be honest, I'm not sure it qualifies as a ""capstone project""; it was more like a normal course with multiple, smaller programming challenges. Alex's teaching style shone in this practical problem-centered curriculum, and as a result, I was much more engaged than in the theory-heavy courses like Number Theory. I especially enjoyed the module on dynamic programming; it's good to see some more advanced content, even if it's optional. Please make future courses similar to this one! ",0,0,Ethan Ho,47300438
23410024~COURSE!~IKJ3iHh-EeebgxJJUk2AAg,1609621005685,5,0,This one can be completed much faster than the others. It is only 3 weeks. It took me about 6 hours to go through everything. The lessons are well explained and the exercises very helpful. You should have some understanding of Python (from the previous modules) and graph theory (module 3).
