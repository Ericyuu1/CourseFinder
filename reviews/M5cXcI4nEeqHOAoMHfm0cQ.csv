Glen is clear,  succinct, and makes all the complexity manageable and enjoyable. I am undertaking my own research and practice in Australia, and as such, the time frames, and different time zones and inability to have online live face to face or forum reviews means the reliance on videos and materials offered is very high, and I think as an introduction course Glen succeeds in providing that. I would highly recommend Glen and the course, and would love to see further advanced sessions as outlined in the outro. ",0,1,anna fairbank,81868948
