4249408~COURSE!~zarv50qwEeaovA5yk1oeyQ,1550542324462,1,0,"The video lecture were excellent but there was zero feedback from the professors so no one bothered posting on the forums. The syllabus stated that solutions would be given to quizzes and exams but they never were. For an institution of Georgia Tech's reputation this was a major disappointment. Don't waste your money on this course expecting any feedback. Also, so many of the quizzes had incorrect answers. I provided feedback but stopped after realizing no one paid attention.",0,0,Anthony Savage,4249408
2011892~COURSE!~zarv50qwEeaovA5yk1oeyQ,1663891209058,2,0,"I​n skipping over the physics that actually connects everything, the explanations become muddled and one is required to use rote memorization for many of the applications.  Tipping a toe in theory would have helped this course tremendously.  A good example is the last quiz where the final 2 problems are unnecessarily hard because reflected impedance is only mentioned but not delved into.  I'm reviewing the concepts here rather than taking everything fresh, so I was fine, but it is ripe for problems.  I found the same problems throughout.  T​here is also the problem of a significant programming issues and outright errors in some of the problems and quizzes - look at the forums for some examples.  This is due to this course being neglected for a very long time by its creators.  The 1st course had these as well.I​n addition, the 1st course had a ton of tutorial problem solving videos.  These completely petered out in this course.  Why?I​n general, this is one of the only beginner's electronics courses on Coursera.  And, due to the problems mentioned, is lacking.  As this is a jumping off point for a number of the higher quality Specializations if one has not already learned this stuff, this needs rectified.  Either by the original instructors or commisioning a new course.  Overall, the 1st 2 courses cover what you will need later, but in an uneven way.  Sometimes great, often spotty. And often skipping the theory necessary to develop an intuition for basic electronics.",0,1,Sam Rosenthal,2011892

What I liked the most about this course is the way it presented electrical signal analysis of AC circuits.
