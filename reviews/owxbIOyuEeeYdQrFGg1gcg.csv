(4) Some people claim that although they ""have a strong math background"" the material in lectures is intentionally made sound hard. I have a math background too and found his explanations very intuitive. My undergraduate math treatment of related topics was much more rigorous that this. (5) Others complain about there being too much math/many equations in lectures. ML is about math, if this tiny bit of mathematical rigor is too much for you, you should not be doing ML. (6) To my surprise, some people are wondering who are the target audience. The professor clearly states that the audience for the class is people with ML background willing to learn some financial applications.

This is an uncommon practice, and I welcome it, but not everybody will.For example,there was an assignment involving censored regression that required students to actually do some research - like, searching google or Wikipedia to figure out the special characteristics of the regression problem being posed, and relate it back to the code.  The kind of thing one might expect in a college course.  This stands in contrast to spoon-fed projects and assignment that are common in MOOCs.    This is unfortunately mistaken by many students for an accident (it did not help that there were some technical glitches with grading early on).  It's still easy in terms of poblem-solving in contrast to many Quant MBA -tyype courses.So, for people who want to get a Certificate that they know ML for Finance without doing much to earn it, this class may not be what they're looking for.
