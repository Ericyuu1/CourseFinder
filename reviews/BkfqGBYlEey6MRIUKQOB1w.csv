9754546~COURSE!~BkfqGBYlEey6MRIUKQOB1w,1662638231341,2,0,"There is some good information in this class but it is not one of the better classes on Coursera.  There is no support from the ITT staff to answer question in the discussion forum.  they rely on other learners.  Several of the excercises have bugs that will block you from passing unless you can find a trick to bypass the grader. The questions on the quizzes need to be reviewed as there are lots of sloppy typos and poorly worded questions.Overall, if you are an moderate to expert javascript programmer and you need a refresher course, you can get some information here.  If you are a beginner, this course will only cause frustration. ",0,0,Peter Dicicco,9754546
