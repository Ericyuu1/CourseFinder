The course is good, well-structured and well presented, but most of all easy to follow.The reason for my low rating is that I found out that SAS is far from my favourite program. I found many things counterintuitive and SAS requires a special approach to tackle tasks. It feels like they tried to make it as user friendly as possible by prefixing many things. But in my opinion this ended up being more cumbersome and, as mentioned before, counterintuitive. You really need to know how to handle SAS since it is acting quite special compared to other programming languages.",0,1,Simon B. Cox,45635513

What i like most about SAS courses is they kind of try everything about guidance to make sure that your honest and dedicated work is rewarded with a certificate. During the course you get the feeling that if i do my part i could definetely finish it and learn a lot of great stuff. Among the things i learnt my favourites were iterative do loops and restructuring tables especially with proc transpose. Years ago without  knowing this stuff and how to google this concept(transpose) i tried to self join tables twenty times to transpose it, i did but it took me two months and mental breakdowns, i remember how much i wished somebody to teach me what to do. Now i realize it is actually matter of a few minutes if you know it.  So in short it is a very valuable analytical experience, i strongly recommend it to everyone who is interested in data analytics.
