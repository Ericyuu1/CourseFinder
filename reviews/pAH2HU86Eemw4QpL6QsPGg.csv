673632~COURSE!~pAH2HU86Eemw4QpL6QsPGg,1636467550461,3,0,The course is good if you're trying to learn about computational social science research methods. It doesn't really cover computer simulations in depth. ,0,0,Ashley,673632

33699610~COURSE!~pAH2HU86Eemw4QpL6QsPGg,1600724171108,4,0,"The content and the insight from this course is amazing. I would strongly recommend this course for anyone working as a Data Scientist or working in theory in the social sciences. However, there are a couple videos and content that need to be edited and re-published, which makes some of the content hard to follow. ",0,0,Zack Keim,33699610
84207135~COURSE!~pAH2HU86Eemw4QpL6QsPGg,1642046731411,5,0,"T​his is my favorite, aside from the Capstone. This was the exposure to computer science, coding, and data analytics I needed to propel me forward. I recently complete a B.S in Applied Mathematics. Due my duties as a Marine, I haven't really been able to get exposure to the things like data software and computer simulations. Highly recommended. The UC team is amazing and did a fantastic job putting this together!",0,0,Dwayne Ryals,84207135
37839709~COURSE!~pAH2HU86Eemw4QpL6QsPGg,1639106020717,5,0,"Lovely explanatory course on Computer Simulations, including the benefits and drawbacks of such simulations when trying to come up with theories in Social Science. Quite lengthy yet not at all uninteresting, it strikes a balance between giving you just enough to understand what is going on and teasing you into wanting to know more about the subject.",0,0,Elham,37839709

While the first courses were a tad bit more theoretical, this is the one I've enjoyed the most. It was not only highly theoretical, but also highly functional in showing ways of modeling (in pretty accurate ways) social events and even societies. This will indeed prove to be a useful tool for my current and future jobs.",0,0,Miguel Curiel,52289394
