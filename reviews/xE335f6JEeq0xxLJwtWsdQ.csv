5342010~COURSE!~xE335f6JEeq0xxLJwtWsdQ,1641751439122,1,0,"The material of the course does not match neither the course title nor its description. 50% of the course is a very basic intro to finance, and the other 50% is a very lightly disguised marketing campaign for Goldman. I think it's a real shame that Coursera, having so many real nice courses, and usually so good at picking the courses, allows this one to be on its platform. ",0,2,Dmitri Mossessian,5342010
105094465~COURSE!~xE335f6JEeq0xxLJwtWsdQ,1652142986311,2,0,"Needs better pedagogical design-  each section should begin with a  description of what will be covered and should conclude with the key takeaways from that section. Vidoes whould be broken down into 15-20 mimute segments.    Where selected companies are used as example, a ratinale should be given for their selection and the universe from which they were selected.Sadly much of the courses sounded like a rather smug commercial for Goldman Sachs and its PSI, rather than an unbiased asessment of the forces  created by the fintech industry that are  impacting part of the finance industry. The automation of the various trasnactions processing flows was interesting to someone who worked on Wall Street in the '80s.",0,1,Jane Sadd Smalec,105094465
