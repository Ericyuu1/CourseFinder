For me it was impossible to do homework assignments just from the material in the lectures, at the same time after finishing the homework assignments, I felt like I had a decent grasp of the material.What could be improved:- With the lack of any TAs/instructor on the forums, having clearer formulation of assignment problems would have been helpful.- I wish the instructor spend a bit more time on the intricate and fundamental parts of the material, like the process of band bending and the various forms of current in a PN junction . I think having a more intuitive understanding of this at the beginning would have helped enormously in the assignments.",0,0,oleg ryjkov,1569643

101486802~COURSE!~Y2Lu2G4mEeeWCg71xNIlJg,1649220152348,5,0,"T​his course builds upon the earlier course, Semiconductor Physics.  One needs to complete the latter before studying this course.  As stated in the syllabus, this is an Advanced level course.  However, if one has some basic skills in differential and integral calculus, working through this course becomes easier.  It is also very useful to know the concept of excess and minority carriers, which was covered in the previous course.  I want to stress that one needs to be comfortable with the concepts in the earlier course, especially semiconductor statistics (density of states, equilibrium p & n concentrations, Fermi levels and related probability distributions).  In this course, the basic concepts of the physics at p-n junctions was an eye opener.  I also liked the lecture on metal-semiconductor interfaces and applications of pn junctions, such as in solar cells, laser diodes, LED and photodiodes.  I also want to strongly suggest that you read through the book by Prof. Donald A. Neamen (Semiconductor Physics and Devices) as you go through the lectures, since it will clarify and reinforce many tricky concepts. T​he most useful part of the course, was actually the Homework and Assignments.  The problems in the Homework really helps to drive home the fundamentals.  In many problems, I had a rough idea on how to solve them, but made numerical errors and got some wrong.  However, I really appreciate the fact that we are allowed to resubmit a revised answer and get graded again.  This is actually a good learning approach.  Trying to correct a solution and actually reach the correct solution, is where learing happens.Overall, Prof. Park has done an excellent job in teaching this course.  The course is useful to anyone who wants to expand their understanding of semiconductor pn junctions.  It's good to have this background especially if one wants to work in some way or the other with semiconductors.",0,0,Prakash R. Kota,101486802
