34500923~COURSE!~hDGmBl1-EeqzlxLqkVlYEQ,1589209670131,2,0,This course should disclaim that previous background in coding is strongly recommended. This 4 week course was very difficult to follow - not so much the content but the structure. There were a number of instances where the Professor didn't clearly disclose that he loaded a particular package or read in a certain file. This causes us to spend hours trying to understand. ,0,4,Tyler Biwan,34500923

I was very unhappy about that long wait. A minor issue was that of the two peer reviewers/graders gave me unfair grading on one of the questions. ",0,0,Long Thanh Vo,36054958

33298297~COURSE!~hDGmBl1-EeqzlxLqkVlYEQ,1589330589327,4,0,Thanks for the wonderful introduction to data analytics using R. Module 4 needs a bit of work to make the content more relevant. It would be helpful if the module can focus on how to read those graphs rather than how to program those which can be found from the help documentation as well.

Also, harder concepts should be broken down into multiple 1-3 minute videos rather than lengthy ones as it is rather easy to get lost in the weeds following the steps within the content.",0,1,Deepjyoti Rajkhowa,1896811

84153494~COURSE!~hDGmBl1-EeqzlxLqkVlYEQ,1652549687069,5,0,"I did not take other courses of this specialization so this review show my viewpoint regarding THIS course.I think for people like me who  are not familiar with coding, this course is the best way to start studying R in Coursera. Then they can go over other R courses available.Also, the lecturer, Professor Guymon, tried a lot to sketch a road map from the beginning by introducing the FACT framework, which I think helped me a lot not to get stuck in the plethora of detached materials through this course.The other unique feature I came accross was other types of files which are possible to save or run in R-Studio such as Markdown and Notebook. Because part of the peer-reviewed task asks students to work in those data types, it can help novice students like me to work with those data types.Altogether, this course is a very good shot for the R beginners.",0,2,Mojtaba Dadras,84153494
