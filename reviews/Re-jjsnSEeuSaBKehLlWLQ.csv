No one is taking any action to correct them.The material is very dry just repeating the written content from the learn.microsoft.com website.,0,1,Saadiyya Reid-A.,110069998
15668548~COURSE!~Re-jjsnSEeuSaBKehLlWLQ,1669306725707,2,0,"Good info, but it would have been greatly enhanced with labs you could actually do instead of just read.  Early on, the labs were made in such a way that you could follow along with them(mostly), but they increasingly relied on materials that just didn't exist as their example databases were not available to you.  I don't know why they don't just set up a Git Repo and let the user download the repo into their Azure workspace to get the synapse studio set up and then pull data from wherever they keep it.",0,0,Isaac Sherman,15668548

The labs only have the description of the activities, not the source files necessary to actually do them yourself. Then there are several technical issues (like external content not loading). All in all I would expect much, much better from a company like Microsoft.",0,4,Koen van der Pasch,6128964
