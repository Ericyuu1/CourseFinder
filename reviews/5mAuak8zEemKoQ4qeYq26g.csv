It’s especially disappointing after taking the fantastic specialization by Andrew Ng, and makes this specialization feel like a cheap cash grab by Coursera and DeepLearning.ai. This series of courses fails to prepare you for three reasons:1 – The certification exam is done on whatever is the current version of Tensorflow (v2.6 as of writing). You can’t expect a specialization like this to update every minor release, but much of the coding is still on the v1.X version!2 – The certification exam requires you to work in the PyCharm IDE. The IDE doesn’t even get a mention in this specialization and it is all done through Google Colab.3 – The material is covered at a very superficial level. I was hoping to walk out of it feeling confident in using Tensorflow on novel problems, but I’ve barely learned anything about Tensorflow that I didn’t already get from Andrew Ng’s specialization. There’re a few minutes of lectures (some weeks less than 10 minutes). The programming assignments are either pathetically easy, or lack any guidance on what to do (seriously sometimes there’s no instructions at all, you have to guess what to do by the variable names), or both.

In my view (and I am sad to say this) the present course doesn't live up to that expectation.Of course you could still learn something useful, mostly a selected part of the Keras API. The instuctor is friendly and explains some of the basics of convolutional neural networks. If you are willing to experiment on your own (run the code longer on Colab, play with the hyperparameters, etc) then you get more practice and certainly more out of this experience. Keras has a lot of good tools. For more advanced students going directly to the TensorFlow tutorial website is also an option (and it is free).Overall the course seems a bit rushed, while it has the potential to be better.  Let me suggest adding more basic materials to solidify knowledge (for example practicing hands-on image preprocessing before  teaching the Keras preprocessing API and overall  more experimentation with images). Also adding  more exercises on more diverse topics (GAN's, face detection, variational autoencoders, object detection). There are also some minor issues (easy to fix): for example right now in the Week 3 HW the prepared callback teaches the students  exactly the wrong approach. It stops the learning cycle when the training accuracy improves over a certain threshold,  instead of checking the validation accuracy.

The level of detail and instructions is not on par with the quality of both the Coursera platform and the professors associated with this course.It seems that as I progress through the courses in this specialization the instructions get poorer and poorer and the level of information gets more and more scarce. It got to a point where we are just given notebooks to run; they are not even graded (they barely were on the first course). And even the notebooks where the we are given a chance to complete some code, there are absurd things like ""print(#your code here#)"" in places that don't even make sense except if we copy and paste from the other notebooks of the course. Really? Print what? The only way we can guess what kind of debug info the notebook is asking is by looking at other notebooks at that exact same line.For the reviewers; if you are really reading this, please remember that Coursera is charging $49/month for this specialization. If we consider that an average student will take 4 weeks to complete, that's almost $200 for something that's barely a tutorial at it's current version. $49 may be a reasonable rate for a citizen of the US, for example, but it's and exorbitant amount of money for students of poorer countries using the platform in hopes of acquire knowledge of decent quality.",0,1,Henrique Gorni,62587

Thanks to Andrew and Laurence for putting this together, is a great source of information to understand more about DL. Some things I think could improve the course. I found the transfer learning lessons a bit unclear and I struggle generalizing this to other cases. Also, I was a bit confused by the flow of the course. The course starts with a multi classifier (or actually, the previous course), then the lessons focus on binary classifiers and it ends again with multi classifiers, because these should be the more complex ones.One last technical thing, only on the last lesson of this course it is mentioned that the classifiers output the probabilities on alphabetical order when using ImageDataGenerators (or at least, that's my impresision). I've wondered since the course introduced the ImageDataGenerators, how the probabilities are assigned on the outputs. I could figure out on the sigmoid that the classifier would look for the first class on the directory and output 1 or 0 based on that, but it would be good to have this mentioned at some point on the video when the ImageDataGen is introduced.Thanks again!

In addition to that, I liked the idea behind dropout regularization, one of the strongest techniques to reduce interdependence between neurons and consequently minimize overfitting.  In the end, I got impressed by the shift from binary to multi-class classification and the fact that we no longer have to limit our results to two different output classes but to many more.
