By the title and the topic, it had the potential to be a true gem among the courses offered on this site, since the topic is diverse yet very relevant to a lot of students, and the information could have supported potential researchers into the initial phases of their studies (which as far as I understand is the ultimate goal of the course, and my intention when I joined). However, the course is just lazy. The creators did not have in mind to provide any useful information, insights, or advice. They recorded one-minute videos with UCL researchers and used parts of those one-minute long interviews in diverse videos so that, along with a total of 10 minutes of content for the first course of the week, you watch the same vague, already well-known affirmations all over. This means you learn nothing, and you're left with minus 10 minutes of your precious time.Having completed many other Coursera courses I can say it's the first time I find one that is so pretentious it makes you want to believe that you are gaining any valuable knowledge in a total of 10 minute videos and a less than challenging activity.  Literally, this review has taken me more effort than completing the contents of the whole of the first week.

I know it is a long review, and feel free to remove it from the list, if you deem it appropriate. I have learned a lot in the course, and it is a valuable experience still.   My problem lies with the design of the course, that seems to have started with great vigour at then lost the steam at the end. I would like to suggest few pointers. Especially since the presenters have another courses in the catalogue with similar issues.  1. Help learners to focus - Body language, and position in the room. Standing in front of windows with the traffic outside may seem a minor thing, but it detracts form you and the content. As a course designer it is a responsibility to set it right. Same applies for hands in back pockets, posture when sat down, lens flare etc.  2 - As instructors you have offered very little teaching. All was left to the guest speakers. All very good and knowledgeable. Some graphic and own mini lecture would help to establish you as experts (not that you are not, but we would not know that from the videos), rather than mere interviewers. (Summary of what was said).  3 - match the video and e-tivity focus. And think about the accessibility of the material to your learners, especially if no previous knowledge is required. Week three was about managing research and planning. The reading, was surprisingly different (week 4 activity would be more suitable here) and really hard to access to someone, who hasn't done much reading in theories of knowledge etc. This would be more accessible as a guided lecture and quiz, rather than 400 words response.  I hope I was not offensive to anyone. I was trying to help you to help us learn better, if that makes sense.  M   ",0,12,M. Imrich,4102412

The course content was very engaging as it included interviews with graduate students and professors alike who are doing their researches. Quite fittingly, I commend the creators of this course for recognizing the fact that most online courses on research methods out there focus on having a linear tackling of lesson topics. For this course, it stressed the key issues and reflections of individuals who are doing the actual rudiments of the thing we call ""research"". More importantly, this course was also critical and relevant in many respects as it allowed us to have some write-ups about the topics without requiring us to go through many readings. It is in this sense that I would say that it its relevant--concise and direct in its approach, the instructors have seen to it that what they are to discuss will be the things which new comers to the research endeavor might ask.Kudos to the team!
