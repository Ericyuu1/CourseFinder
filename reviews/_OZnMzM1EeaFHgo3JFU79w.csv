58494576~COURSE!~_OZnMzM1EeaFHgo3JFU79w,1588692768641,1,0,"In the begining i had difficulties with an accent- but subtitles are really helpfull, unfortunatelly course is prepared in not efficient way. You are spending a lot of time to make your own research- so in fact what's the point of the course? It doesn't give you informations instead it is very unclear, and time consuming. I found the other course same tematic at the other platform- much better organised. ",0,0,,58494576
4141380~COURSE!~_OZnMzM1EeaFHgo3JFU79w,1585057868539,1,0,"This MOOC does not match the quality of others I have taken. The video lectures jump into decision theory and do not present any context or understanding of the EU's present-day structure except to refer publicly available material on europa.eu. In short, this course is not very coherent without significant self-study (so what's the point?). In only the first week, ""European Business Law: Understanding the Fundamentals"" from Lund University actually gave me a better understanding of EU, by starting with the history and looking at the various treaties and principles in them.",0,8,John Chang,4141380
55045628~COURSE!~_OZnMzM1EeaFHgo3JFU79w,1605530411206,2,0,"While the lectures are fine and the reading materials are great, I feel that the quizzes were too easy. They do not test understanding of the topic, and it is possible to complete the course in 2-3 days just by searching for answers in the reading materials. Perhaps you will feel more satisfied if you choose to go with the Honours Track, but for those who opted to do it this can be a slightly underwhelming experience",0,0,Pavel Chernov,55045628
34784184~COURSE!~_OZnMzM1EeaFHgo3JFU79w,1547041487164,2,0,"First of all, I had great difficulties to understand the accent of the tutors in this course. Sometimes, the videos were not matching the subtitles. It is a great course, however for the tasks requiring research on specific countries of EU, it was very hard to find answers to certain questions due to missing information on EUROSTAT and not only. Meanwhile i was searching for the specific information from the national institutions (it takes sometimes up to 2 weeks to have an official answer from administration), i found that the questions were totally changed, which thing added hardship to my already existent struggle. Topping up with the fact that for the following month I had to pay a renewal, right, for not completing the course within one month. So, economically speaking, to pay extra 50$ for the course and a total of 100$ is not worth.That's my opinion about the course. Maybe others would find it different. I like EU law though and I m willing to pursue with other course.",0,7,Cosmos,34784184
22593063~COURSE!~_OZnMzM1EeaFHgo3JFU79w,1603763473950,3,0,"The course was good and provided me with the information I was seeking but was FAR too heavy in reading bureaucratic academic texts for my liking. Professor Steunenberg is, however, an excellent teacher on the subject and made the course worthy of taking. Thank you to both University Leiden and the professor for the course.",0,0,Anthony Theodoulou,22593063
4922355~COURSE!~_OZnMzM1EeaFHgo3JFU79w,1591567537265,3,0,"The course was interesting but focuses a lot on theories (of decision-making and political dynamics within EU politics). The honors track allows to apply the concepts to a concrete and detailed EU policy file, but requires a lot more work. 
You need to have a good understanding of the EU institutional framework to enjoy the course.

37916162~COURSE!~_OZnMzM1EeaFHgo3JFU79w,1590777374503,3,0,"Course could be a lot more interesting with smaller case studies, real life examples and actual data in videos and breakdown of that data, interpretation and analysis rather than having multiple research paper readings corresponding to each video. Although research papers are appreciated and are a form of great academic knowledge, too many of them don't serve the purpose of ""learning"" for people who are new to the entire policy formation process. Otherwise, the course is brilliant with it's content and the depth it chooses to go into. With a few minor changes, this could get a lot more interesting. Thank you!",0,4,Nikita Sachanandani,37916162
13621984~COURSE!~_OZnMzM1EeaFHgo3JFU79w,1490869819909,3,0,"  The lectures made by the professor were really helpful and provided many insights into policy making within the EU. However, some tasks such as filling air pollution standards were not that insightful. Also, unsynchronized subtitles were a bit annoying same for the poor sound from invited professors in air pollution videos of chapters 4 and 5.",0,0,Borja √Ålvarez,13621984
