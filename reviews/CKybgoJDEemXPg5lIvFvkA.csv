81521255~COURSE!~CKybgoJDEemXPg5lIvFvkA,1614263962924,5,0,"Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! The only thing that I do not like is the referencing back to Block code writing. It has been years since I have coded in my former life as a Project Manager/Analyst and I learned ""old-school"" style where you just coded. Because I will be teaching Java and hopefully next year Python ... learning about Block coding is personally of no benefit to me. Because most all of my students have NEVER coded, they will just learn Java. That being said, when I taught in the states I was an advid supporter of code.org and we did the week of code every year because I thought it important for the students and I agree that using the Block coding was helpful for an introduction. All in all I look forward to the remaining courses! üòÅ",0,0,Leza Baker,81521255

Moreover, the Preussal evaluation score is not up to the mark. The course videos are really really worth watching and CS Awesome Material is Wonderful. Unlike. all the best Java Courses it is the best best !!!!",0,0,ARKAPRAVO NANDI,36175233
