Then Mr. Harris continues reviewing how to implement concurrent programs in Go, which is explained in a clear way with some exceptions. Explaining concurrent concepts is never easy but Mr. Harris does a decent job. I'm only rating the course with 3 stars because there is zero support from course assistants, if you have questions about assignments or quizzes. There is no trace of them in the discussion forums, which are mainly full of requests from other students requesting to review their assignments. You get a sense that the course has been abandoned. Also there are not many students taking the course at the same time which makes it harder to get someone to review week 4 assignment to complete the course and earn course certificate.Finally, be careful if you taking this course as part of the Go specialization as you will be charged for the subscription even though you have completed the three courses of the specialization and have earned the specialization certificate.
