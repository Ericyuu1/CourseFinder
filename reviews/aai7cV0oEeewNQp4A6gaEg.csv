Instructor and teaching staff are non-charlant i.e. they do not get involved or take any responsibility. I had a terrible experience e.g. assignments were submitted as early as February 6, 2019 and not one person has graded any one of them (June 22, 2019). I left numerious posts on the discussion forum (Week 1 to 8) and there has been no response, even from Instructor and teaching staff. SHAMBOLIC!!!!",0,0,adrian adewunmi,1580748
