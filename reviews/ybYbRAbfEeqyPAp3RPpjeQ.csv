However, as the course progresses, teachers/narrators change and their voices become ever so slurred and less enthusiastic/clear.W​ould have liked that the entire course was taught by the same professor.",0,0,Andrés Romo,84826583
81495774~COURSE!~ybYbRAbfEeqyPAp3RPpjeQ,1620384454894,3,0,"It is indeed a very interesting course, I took interesting knowledge out of it and I enjoyed most of it. The first teachers, specially Rasmus, are very clear and very easy to follow. But in the middle of the course there are some quite technical issues and the teacher was very difficult to understand (in addition to a monotous tone) that made me watch it several times to be able to answer the quizzes correctly... in adittion the subtitles do not help, because they seem to be generated automatically and very often misunderstand words (or directly indicates ""inaudible""). There is for sure a script for the course, why don't you give the students the script directly, to avoid misunderstandings?",0,2,Pedro Jorge Romero Royo,81495774
