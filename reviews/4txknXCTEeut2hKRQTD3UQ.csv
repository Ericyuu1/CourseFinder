This course concentrates in windows computer (Windows computers!!!!!!) where sometimes things does not for the simple fact that is windows. The attacks perform are with administrator accounts so obviously it will work. I would recommend to retired this course and start from scratch. (I do apologize)",0,2,Christian Arroyo,87259698
