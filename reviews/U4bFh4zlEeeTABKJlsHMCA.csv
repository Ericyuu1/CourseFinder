Its difficulty is set to intermediate though, contents are so basic. You can't use the skills in real world right after this course. But,Despite all of these shortcomings, the reason why I gave this course 5 stars, if you are really on the first step to blockchain world without any knowledge, you will learn all of the basic concepts of blockchain in this course. Be patient. After complete this course, you can understand almost all of the articles and words of blockchain. Obviously, this lecture doesn't make you an expert but, it makes you prepared one to dive into blockchain world. PS.
