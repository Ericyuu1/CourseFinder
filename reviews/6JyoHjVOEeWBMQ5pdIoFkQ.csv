While it is nice to get exposure to another language, it is more than enough to learn one at a time.2 - Add quizes and/or other well formed questions that are graded (automatically, not peer graded) to help enforce the concepts being taught.3 - Make the assignment instructions/expectations more clear.  I feel there are times when the grading criteria don't exactly match the requested assignment.

It's definitely a great place to start, and with only a few hours a week and simple pointed assignments, it was a soft re entry for me into the academic world. ",0,0,Alex Solomon,8614769

159209~COURSE!~6JyoHjVOEeWBMQ5pdIoFkQ,1442596627594,5,0,"Great course, teaching end-to-end on how to select data, ""prep"" it up, analyse data using SAS/Python and create custom visualizations. The project based course makes it more enjoyable as students can quickly apply the principles presented in each week's videos. The resources to learn Python and SAS may not be make you a ""star"" programmer (since this is not a programming course), but are more than adequate to get a newbie learn enough to process data and work effectively. Definitely recommend to anyone to get an excellent head-start on data analysis from a business and academic research perspective.",0,0,Anupama Rajaram,159209
