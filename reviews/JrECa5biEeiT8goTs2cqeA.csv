12382634~COURSE!~JrECa5biEeiT8goTs2cqeA,1574210633539,4,0,"Enjoyed this course, but it could be improved. I did not like that there was music in the background of the lecture videos. This makes it just harder to understand the voices. Furthermore, there are quite some errors in the translations and material.  The grammar points material has quite some deficits. The explanations are just not understandable.Besides this, I liked it and had a great time. It feels better than the classical HSK route. It has a fresher and more modern feel to it. Many thanks for this class.",0,0,Dennisio del torro,12382634

Thank you very much, SJTU and Coursera! It's been a positive learning experience ðŸ¤“ If there's one suggestion to give, it'd be to incorporate the Instructor's feedback on the Peer-Graded assignment as well as the discussion activity of each section. I've participated in every Discussion activity at the end of each section and I'd appreciate it if the instructors can give some feedback on whether my usage of Chinese language is correct and state the room of improvement. ðŸ¤“ That way, I can maximise my learning.

Come on people, have some academic integrity and ethics. Apart from that, it's an excellent course. You get what you put into, and you will learn a lot. ",0,0,Abhinav Shukla,29513793
