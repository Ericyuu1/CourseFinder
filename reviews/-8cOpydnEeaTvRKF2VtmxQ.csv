There is a consistent reference in the lectures to this course being a MOOC which after a short while caused me to believe that the graduate level course at LBS that this was based on is indeed more rigorous and this MOOC is ""dumbed-down"" to make it more accessible. In my view, deeper learning comes when a learner is challenged to think differently.Assignments are not peer-reviewed for quality, just for content. Some of the better moments in this course happen during particular case studies, notably Disney and Southwest Airlines. There are also a few great interviews with leaders of firms such as Unilever.

Critique:  While Nader (the course professor)  provided engaging and thought-provoking content, I noticed some business references to Marketing (industry insider & first-world specific) language.  As an entry-level course, you might assume some students might struggle with these references.  If not already in the industry or from the more sophisticated regions of the US and Europe. Feedback:  It is an excellent entry option to the latest thinking on Brand Management.  I do not know if this is possible, but the course date stamp relates to references and case studies - pre-2015 when it was first published.  Perhaps an appendix showing more recent case studies and surveys relating to how the content of the subjects covered is equally relevant in 2020, as new attendees take the course.

I appreciated most of the guest interviews, particularly the P&G and Saatchi and Saatchi ones which were really insightful and engaging. My main critique would be that the lectures at times felt too conversational. There wasn't enough of a focus on theoretical concepts/frameworks to understand the material, particularly in week 4 and 5.
