They include typos/ambiguities that force you to spend a lot of time trying to figure out what instructions mean vs actually learning how to code. Little things like writing ""less than"" when the coder really needs to use ""less than or equal to"" amount to time wasted that is not spent learning to code.

106759622~COURSE!~NGp_fFyyEeqOiwpmHr8y8Q,1664341927262,3,0,"The course moves really fast.  You get a bunch of videos that are less than a minute long, with a few 2 minute ones in there.  You can blow through all of the video content in a module in a few minutes.  Then you get a quiz which is only difficult because you've only had ~4-5 minutes of time spent with the material (unless you watched the videos several times).  But you'll pass the quiz without too much difficulty because you can either rewatch videos to get the answers or just retake it until you pass.  I don't find that experience to be that useful.  T​he programming assignments are frustrating because they are harder than any of the examples given and require you to know the material well enough to apply it to something else.  That's quite difficult because you have to use information that got less than a minute of attention in the course.  If you ever had a horrible experience in a math classroom because a teacher did one easy example on the board and then expected you to do far harder problems on the exam without really explaining how or why any of it works, you may find this course to feel like that.  I don't personally like this format for learning.  I also found the directions to be ambiguous in a few cases. T​he assignments also seem to be a bit buggy.  Putting aside the usual issues with Jupyter Notebooks that people run into (not running cells in the correct order, etc.), I find that I had tremendous difficulty with a few of the assignments and those issues were not with my code.  I would run the cells and have my answers get rejected.  After an hour of pulling out hair wondering how I was wrong, I'd walk away.  A few hours later, I'd open up the notebook again, run the EXACT same code, and the answers would be accepted.  There is nothing more annoying than having a correct answer get rejected and wasting hours wondering why it was wrong.   This doesn't seem to be an isolated experience--there are tons of people in the discussion forums posting about how their answers weren't accepted and they don't understand why, with the course staff replying that the answers were accepted.  I​ don't want to be unfairly negative.  The production quality is good and the staff are reponsive in the forums.  I just think the course is weirdly hard for an introduction.  It's one of those introductory courses that sort of only works well if you already know the material already.  But then, why take the introductory course?   The course would be a lot better if they spaced it out and went slower.  I think the videos need to be longer with more examples.  That would allow people who don't ""just get it"" to not feel overwhelmed with the large amount of information while also allowing experienced people to just skip over that stuff if they don't need it.

15450871~COURSE!~NGp_fFyyEeqOiwpmHr8y8Q,1614228859576,5,0,"Video lectures were split() into short fragments which I enjoyed very much. Brandon, the professor of the class is very much involved with the audience and he is not monotonous. This is a huge plus! The only point of improvement that I would like to mention is; in some assignments the ask could be more clear. However, this comes with a hidden advantage, it gets you researching the Python libraries/documents, and learn about more advanced topics with trial and error. This is not a class to just watch the lectures, if you like to do self-research and looking for a foundational class to build upon, don't miss it. Make sure to install pyCharm and Jupyter in your local machine to test your code more efficiently (he walks your through how to do that during the class). All in all, this is a high-quality class that deserves five stars, especially recommended for finance professionals.  ",0,0,Hüseyin Cem Üçer,15450871

He also seems to know when to repeat explanations or specific details.  The technical support using Jupyter Notebook is very good.  My only complaint is that the auto-grading sometimes doesn't consider that the order of completion may vary while the final results are effectively the same.",0,0,John Lamertina,4049253
