The entire week 6 exercises could not completed without extensive debugging efforts because the notebooks are outdated. The discussion forum is also not informative in that respect, as errors reported by other learners did not receive any response. Finally, it would be helpful if the staff could properly format the codes as displayed in the quizzes and tests. At present, codes are displayed in individual lines that makes comparison among the options challenging.",0,0,Shayne Li,94636655

However, PLEASE update the databricks notebooks! Many of them contain errors or code that throws errors.",0,0,Cameron Wong,76613087
