Anyone wanting to think about behaviour on a more rigorous or complex level (or with animals coming from more difficult backgrounds) should go elsewhere. 
Even when presented with a question about what could be done with an adult dog's behavioural problems, the instructors chose to answer only with ""this is why it's important to socialise your puppy, so remember how important socialisation is to a dog's life.""

It provided me with valuable information about cat and dog behaviors and practical ideas for catering for my own cats. My experience with dogs is limited so it was a good opportunity to get some education on dogs. The only thing that I would have liked to see more of is a bit more focus on cat outdoor behavior, like how to train cats to take them for walks ( if possible) and whether it is a good idea or not, training cats to be more fearless. I just think that there was more focus on dogs in this area.Thanks again for the excellent course!",0,0,Mary Maher,905862

It helped me  re examine my views on every aspect of how we  view our pets and animals in general. From the environment we introduce them into, to the thought,  and care we put into making their life happy and meaningful through all stages of their life cycle. Most importantly it hi lighted the  critical pre stage of why and how we approach owning a pet. Reminding me of the pre-nuptial agreements people make before marriages. But it make clear the hug life time commitment to the good of the animal for the period of its life time and the full impact of the seriousness of that. It opened up the whole world of  pets, cats and dogs and has made me want to learn more. I have been in the position of CARER to some one 24/7 for a long number of years. In between I was adopted by a stray cat. I was nervous , coming into this course, of  how I could manage coming back to learning but it was so interesting and enjoyable that it boosted my confidence and made me want to continue to expand my knowledge about animals, with feline studies in particular.

VERY GOOD COURSE! THANKYOU  I run into dilemma

i work in contryside here and adopted injured cute cat last year, she was at age of 6 months few years ago.

She's now doing well here at my workplace which consists of wide area, green fields , gardens, farm, hillsides, some residency houses and small flats. She get on well with old granny cat despite a battle during first few months and now almost everyone here know her . Now another black cat come to join us too.

I have a plan for my master degree and get higher salary jobs,  so I be in two minds, take her along or let her stay.

if I take her to new environment that surely be much more small space in small flats nearby the university or new company

I may deposit her at my mum's grocery but last time i heard about that place is mum's old cat be eaten cruelty by the stray dogs pack

Or I better let her enjoy life here as usual and come to visit sometimes? until I have a big house... I must miss her surely.
