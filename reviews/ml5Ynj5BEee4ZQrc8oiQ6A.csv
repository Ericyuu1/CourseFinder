Then again I have ample OOP basics, so take my opinion with a pinch of salt.Missed opportunity that the peer-reviewed Unity tasks are incompatible with the MOOC format, hence ungraded, but they're interesting enough that I would do them involuntarily.If there's a room for improvement, it would be the quality of in-video quizzes because while I understand that its purpose is mainly to keep us on track (much like Netflix's ""Are you still watching?""), it becomes more like a task of picking the answer that sounds the least ridiculous, where it could have been a great tool for internalizing and recap.

For example, all lectures of the week 3 are a bit belated, given that everyone who got to this point already knows (and uses) the provided information. And it would be much better to include it in the 1st course of specialization where beginners really need it. Also, I got dissapointed by the peer-review system. First, there is no more code review in this course, only builds playing. I found it was better before, when I could see others' source code. Second, once I recieved inappropriate grades from peers just because of their negligence (for example, one said that I didn't have a timer in my game but actually there was a timer).

Why do you sometimes need to set a variable to a component of a gameObject, alter the parts of the variable, then re-assign the variable to the gameObject?#2. How can we offset the transform when instantiating a new GameObject at the location (and more importantly, rotation) of another GameObject (eg. Asteroid spawning, Laser firing, etc)?#3. Audio. We largely skipped over this topic and it was added very quickly with virtually no explanation. This makes me a sad panda. :(Aside from that, the course material is great.
