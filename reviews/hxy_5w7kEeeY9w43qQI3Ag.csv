Discussion questions are too open-ended and since there's no feedback from staff, students are left to wonder if they're understanding the materal presented.  Video format is distracting and often not pertinent to the subject under discussion.  This course would be much better if the professor just lectured and provided quizzes to check for understanding.  Can't recommend it until problems are fixed.",0,1,Sharon Y.  Abrams,5111521

The course lecturers also stress the importance of engaging with alternative views and being skeptical about the strength of our own assumptions. The assessments were intriguing (though the links to the various films need to be updated). ANd the peer-review system could be tweaked to be made more effective. Overall though I really appreciated what I learned from this course, and felt it furthered my knowledge of and interest in the topic of skepticism. ",0,0,Siobhan Lyons,64562797

philosophers/teachers who presented the lecture material in a pleasant and
clear manner.     The special locations where the videos are recorded, make watching the
videos ageeable.   The text below the videos was a good addition.                                                                                                           The advised or required literature was
always available via a link. To make the essay's as requested, I regularly used
other and complementary literature. For me that was an enrichment of the study. For all this I am grateful to the teachers.                                                                                                                   

To anyone who is interested in philosophy, I can heartily recommend this course
