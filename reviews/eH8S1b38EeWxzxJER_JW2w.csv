Most videos are just some declarative statements on why design is important, why color is important, etc. No real new knowledge. 'Instructive' videos for the practical tasks - no ideas who is the target audience. For newcomers in design, like me, - everything is super fast, unclear, difficult to follow. I had to watch additional videos and google some instructions on my own (why then to take the course? I could do this without the course). For experience designers - nothing new, I'm sure. In general, the only more or less valuable information - youtube video of the teacher on Illustrator. No moderators on the course forum - if you in trouble with the software or puzzled by some question, noone will help. Additionally, the teachers speaks veeeery fast and sometimes absolutely unclear, even subtitles do not work sometimes. I belive my listening skills in English are close to perfect, but even for me sometimes it was a challenge to understand what's going on.

There is no chance that anyone walking into the course with zero experience in AI can pass.  No chance, period!The final project grading is unfair & ridiculous.

Your classmates with experience in adobe are scoring you based upon the instructors ""excellent"" examples.  Not realistic at all.I would also point out that the course is excellent for journalists but completely useless for those of us in the business world.

I have then been kindly asked to reconsider my comments under the light of the usefulness of this course to some audience. For sure, it might be that I was not of the attended audience. And I still think that this course was of no interest to me - this is the reason why I'm still pleased not to have paid for its useless certificate. Nevertheless, this course might be of interest for some students. This is definitively true. So, let me suggest a new title for it: ""Design and Make Infographics for the Dummies"". Because that's it! This course is definitively perfect for the ones who know nothing about Infographics and they might enjoy it. Finally, I shall neither modify nor remove my previous comments on the examples used by the author.Please notice that Coursera still gets all my confidence about the usefulness and the quality of their proposed courses. For instance, just have a look to the course ""Machine Learning"" of one of its co-founders, Andrew Ng.------------------------------------My previous comments here below:For sure I was not the correct audience for this course. But nothing useful to be learned in here. Karl Gude is too much speaking of what he has formerly done, which is of only interest to him. I dislike the examples he uses : violence, sex, illness, accidents, weapons, war, drugs - and fruits, ok. Are these the only topics of interest to him?

I acquired some very specific and useful skills, which I developed  by completing projects on topics of my choosing that were meaningful to me. I really liked Karl's casual and somewhat spontaneous style - this is a breath of fresh air from the video tutorials out there where lecturers are reading from prompts or reciting from memory. The biggest drawback to this course is that it relied completely on peer grading for the assessment (which you have to pay for). I don't think this assessment method was sufficiently designed to reduce the influence of graders who were overly subjective, hadn't sufficiently mastered the content themselves, or were disinterested in putting effort into the peer review. From now on, I will think twice about paying for any course where all of the assessment is based on how my classmates grade me. While peer review can be useful for learning, I don't think it's an accurate assessment tool. Especially if I'm paying to learn from a professional in a field, I'd expect to receive some feedback and assessment from that pro.Another area of improvement is that there were several instances where videos repeated things covered in previous videos.

The only aspect that I would change is the technical level of (some of) the lectures: sometimes they are even too easy, and a lot of time is used to explain very basic stuff.

Some recommendations for improvements.1) Adjust the estimated time to complete the assignments.  It took me a lot more than the estimates to complete them.  2) The grading system especially on the final assignment is too difficult.  You need to be EXCELLENT to pass and this is difficult to achieve in a subjective peer review rating.  3) I did not expect to be responsible of providing grades for classmates.  It is not clear if the university offering the course will provide feedback.  Feedback from the experts is what I expected when I bought the certificate.4) I had to do my final assignment on a different software as my free trial subscription for Adobe Illustrator expired.Overall, it was a productive course for me and I did learn from it.",0,0,Ma Soledad Gaston,13856903
