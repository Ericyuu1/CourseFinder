However, the quizzes are written in improper and confusing English, and make the assessments needlessly difficult. There were also several points where I found that I got questions wrong despite my answers being directly from the lectures. I found myself spending more effort on trying to ""crack"" the quizzes than on actually learning the material.

79660574~COURSE!~_HnWrRtDEeWP9g4JMjGIiQ,1638839668538,5,0,"The course is covering application of HTMD in a broad range of materials. I have already suggested the course to a friend who came back happy. We both surprised by the very efficient approach of HTMD into materials research.You need to have a solid background in materials science and metallurgy to understand the basic concepts of the course.Some references studied high number of samples in a very short time scale that is a surprise in materials science. However, some references are out dated. Some of the questions are written in improper and confusing English, and make the assessments needlessly difficult. More effort and time is needed to crack the quizzes than on actually learning the material. Modification of the quizzes will save a lot of time of the students who need to learn more.I believe, if the course leaders were looking into HTMD from Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, they were delivering the course in a more efficient way. This can be an approach to the future courses.So, I believe the course needs to be updated both in term of content and the questions, despite the fact that is fruitful and provides an insightful approach to HTMD.",0,0,Alireza Valizadeh,79660574
