Lectures and videos are messy and boring, labs are hard to get through, quizzes are dummy and there's no real assignment checker. And I'm an experienced FPGA developer, familiar with Altera design flow. I don't recommend this course to anyone, it's not even a course but a bunch of poorly linked boring videos. The worst 50$ spending in my life.",0,5,Konstantin Vinogradov,22491348

3772155~COURSE!~9IY-WIVLEeiY1Qq3mDz8kA,1589973780616,1,0,The software assignments assume that the user is familiar with the Intel FPGA SDK flow and has Intel® Quartus® Prime Pro software version 19.1 with Arria® 10 family support installed. This is a tall ask. The instructors need to create a module 0 where they explain how to setup the system before starting with the openCL fundamentals. Additionally there should make available a time limited license for students to use while enrolled in the course,0,4,Prashant Dabholkar,3772155

It's so difficult install intel FPGA SDK packages: on linux it's impossible running correctly the exercises, some errors occurs. At last, I achieve install it in windows, and compile with aoc and aocl tools, but information about how made it is no in this course. This is the main reason for my low score.",0,0,Andres Jimenez Villa,11303277

The content of the course was very basic and all labs requires Linux machine (even though Intel offers Windows version of their tool). I did not feel any more confident with OpenCL since before this course, I wrote exactly one OpenCL kernel.",0,0,Jan Kastil,159713

53557125~COURSE!~9IY-WIVLEeiY1Qq3mDz8kA,1586339578165,2,0,"The topic is really interesting  but there are some prerequisites for your system that were not declared in the description. Moreover, a question in one of the tests was not implemented well, to be more specific you chose the correct answer and when you submitted it the feedback you would get is ""Incorrect! Correct: the answer you gave"". Of course, this is an issue as long as these tests were obligatory for the the Certificate. During week 2 we were supposed to submit a code. This the point I decided to stop this course, not only I needed Quartz Prime Pro (which is not free and not declared in the description) but also as a peer student found out the grader would only accept as correct a .txt file with character 1 inside. I kid you not!  On the bright side the videos were well-structured and the concept of OpenCL was explained sufficiently given that this is an introductory course. I am sure that this course is not the rule for coursera, undoubtedly there must be a lot of excellent courses provided. But given that this is the first course I watched (and paid) in Coursera.org I am pretty disappointed. I hope my refund request wont be denied.",0,3,Athanasios Markou,53557125
84414679~COURSE!~9IY-WIVLEeiY1Qq3mDz8kA,1618795265629,3,0,"Good content. The only issue was how the graded programming assignments were handled. Submission failures universally produced a result ""reread the instructions"" with no further details provided. The course provided source code solutions, even these failed to submit. Has me wondering if there is some issue with the grader back end. Ended up still able to pass the course, and the programming exercises were useful and ran well, but was a source of frustration. Might be better if they eliminated the grading and just showed what the output of each program looks like so you can self verify and move on. Based on the forum postings, many others were similarly frustrated or confused by this part of the course.",0,0,Syd Logan,84414679
