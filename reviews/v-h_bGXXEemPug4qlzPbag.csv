I found that this course had further augmented what I had  taken when I was doing my undergraduate degree. The additional skills and knowledge that I have gleaned from this course will not only help me professionally in dealing with people who have substance use disorders. These same skills will serve me well in my personal life as I know friends, family and people who are suffering from addiction to alcohol and other harmful substances as I can transfer the skills from the clinical environment into my day to day interactions with people I know who suffer from some form of substance use disease. The extra knowledge that I received in this course on top of the cursory knowledge I have learned in my undergraduate studies should prepare me to deal more effectively with the addicted population that we see in mental health clinical settings but again this knowledge goes well beyond the clinical environment and has real world applications that I can use in my daily life too often. Thanks to all involved in the organizing the highly relevant content and those who presented the content in an organized, user friendly format. I would highly recommend this course to anyone regardless of whether they have any knowledge of the subject matter whatsoever.
