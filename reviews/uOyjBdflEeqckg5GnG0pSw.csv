90092214~COURSE!~uOyjBdflEeqckg5GnG0pSw,1663866737308,1,0,"T​his course does nothing to help ready anyone for a CompTIA A+ Exam as the practice questions have large grammatical errors and the majority of the questions/answers are not relevant to today's standards of operating and servicing Software and Hardware.

Furthermore, the overall course is a failure even before this due to the lack of information before the exams.
Typically, a Course of any kind should give information, even if it's just a reading, to comprehend the subject matter before quizzing the person on that knowledge. This course does no such thing and only previews an overview of what will be ""Taught"" in each section of the course. Then it's followed by an Optional Discussion prompt, then the Quiz itself. This leaves me to assume that I am to fumble my way through the Practice Course, guessing answers to questions I may not know and not knowing why the answers are what they are.

No real learning was provided by this ""practice"" just strengthing memory retention and a Memory Matching  Game to pass this particular Quiz.  ",0,11,Manuel Chachere,90092214
