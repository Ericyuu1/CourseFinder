100152264~COURSE!~PTv7VGsyEeujCAp2B-77jQ,1665675461270,3,0,"T​he course covers most of the basics around science communication and the teacher explained all concepts very clearly. However, I feel a lot of examples were centered around the teacher's experience, including multiple promotions of her own book. I also thought the course materials could be extended, for instance with research articles on science communication. ",0,0,Janneke Elzinga,100152264
94658414~COURSE!~PTv7VGsyEeujCAp2B-77jQ,1637021541218,3,0,"I​ think the topic of this course is very interesting and relavant, especially in this day and age. The content is delivered well and in a clear and accessible manner. While I really enjoyed the theoretical aspects of the course, the practical elements could have been explained and illustrated more clearly. Some of the content (e.g., the interviews) were not really that helpful in learning the skills introduced in this course. The interviews should be part of the Extra Materials and the time gained used to offer more input on the practical aspects of Science Communication.",0,1,Adina,94658414

57167210~COURSE!~PTv7VGsyEeujCAp2B-77jQ,1639115025896,5,0,"T​hank you Prof Melanie Peffer for this wonderful course; really appreciate your effort and dedication.It was totally a new experience. During this COVID pandemic learning effectively from an online course was really a blessing. Special thanks to all the team members. Hope I can continue my journey in the science communication. The TED talks, interview with the science communicators, introducing some of the kids’ magazine , cartoons made this course more interesting. The week 4 “Decoding science: Technology based communication” and week 5 “Creating science: Artistic forms of communication “can be provided as a new course. It is a less explored and promising field of science communication. Once again thank you. ",0,0,Padmapriya M,57167210
