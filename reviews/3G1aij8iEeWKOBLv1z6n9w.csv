You are essentially teaching elementary grade material to pre-schoolers. You also do not go too much into the grammar and important things that Korean learners should know. Because of this, people do not know what they are learning. Thank you for taking your time to teach this 선생님 but I think this course needs a MAJOR revamp. One thing I did like is the pronunciation sections. As an intermediate learner, I thought those were more valuable. But the fact that you are teaching things that are too difficult to beginner learners is not good. This is class is called ""first step in Korean"".

As an absolute beginner, this has made the course quite stressful & frustrating, particularly when trying to learn the vocabulary sections of the lectures.Instead of being able to learn proper pronunciation with the aid of phonetic translations written in English, I'm having to work out each individual character myself, then listen to the lecture again & hope that I've gotten it right (& sometimes it's difficult to tell, particularly for sounds like 'g' & 'k').I'm only on week 2, but I've already had to decide to stop trying to keep up in order to complete quizzes, as I don't feel like I'm learning properly.If you're a BEGINNER beginner to the Korean language, & still want to do this course, I would highly recommend trying to find some additional resources that will help teach you the correct phonetic pronunciation, rather than relying on self-translation from the lectures alone.",0,3,Astin Pepper-Smith,84045739

This course does not help you become even close to basic proficiency because there is no pronunciation key available. The worksheets are so hard to follow because it's all in Hangul with no pronunciation key or english pronunciation available. For a beginner course, this should have been standard- we don't know how to read Hangul and it shouldn't be expected during a beginners course. This course has a lot of room for improvement and would be great once they are implemented to become more user friendly. Also, rather than just using Hangul and English words in the videos, there should be pronunciation underneath the Hangul to make sure students are really getting the words correct instead of them trying to figure out word it is and referring to worksheets all the time.

The modules are comfortably paced and the material is well explained.  I do feel that the course is lacking in some ways, however.S​ome of the test questions and answers didn't seem to make sense, or there were no correct answers in some cases.  The audio clips being offered during the tests were very difficult to understand, and possibly the most frustrating aspect of the course.T​here is virtually no written or spoken aspect to the course, so I found listening to/hearing Korean to be very difficult.  I feel I walked away from this experience with a good foundation of reading, writing and understanding some Hangeul, but I cannot decipher what is being said and I don't feel I have gained much of an understanding of Korean, itself.S​ome of the material in the tests are worded in ways we weren't really properly taught.  Like teaching someone the answer to a question but not actually teaching them what the question is, or how it should sound/be written.  So I'd get to a question, worded in a way (in Korean) I had not yet learned or understood fully, and be able to read 3 or 4 answers that I could understand just fine, but because I had no idea what the question was asking me, I often struggled with these.  They would teach us a simplifed version of the question, and then word it slightly differently in the test, which is a bit misleading and catches you off guard, or so I found.U​ltimately I'd say that this course is good if you want to learn how to read and write Hangeul, but maybe not great for learning Korean.  I can understand a few words, and I can read entire sentences and I am glad.  But when someone speaks to me in Korean, I can't understand any of it.

It's truly a great first step toward learning Korean! :-) Overall, the course has a very good structure, and the instructor in the videos is pleasant. Well done to the instructor and staff who put this class together! ^^ However, there are just a few minor details I would adjust regarding the order of content presentation to make the learning experience better. For example: In 1.2, the test which was about the different sounds was extremely difficult, and it would have been better if the Extended Exercise: Korean Basic Characters Practice with the interactive chart of Korean sounds had been presented before the test, not after it. If it's presented before the test, it will help students to learn and master the sounds before taking the test, so that many more will be able to pass the test on the first try and not feel discouraged and feel as if Korean is too hard to learn. Also, one or two test questions had errors; I submitted some feedback about them when I took the tests. I don't agree with what Professor Kang said at 5:03 in the Lecture 1.3 video, that ㅐ sounds like the short ""a"" in cat. (I think that ㅐ rather sounds more like the short ""e"" in ""get,"" but not like the ""a"" in cat.) However, what she said about ㅐ did help me very much to understand and distinguish the slight difference between the sound of ㅐand ㅔ.  Moreover, I think it would be really great if we could have a complete ""Korean vowels and consonants"" interactive sound chart which includesㅐ and ㅔ and combinations of all the rest of the other vowels and consonants (including the final consonants that change sounds, from lesson 1.4), similar to the Korean Character Practice Program page.I hope this feedback is helpful.

I appreciate the materials being downloadable too, so that students can review all the lessons. A very good introduction to Korean. Potential students should be patient and methodical - if you're used to the Western 'fun and games'/interactive approach to language learning, this is not it. You need to be a self-starter with a decent attention span, as there is a lot of information to digest in a short amount of time (unless you set very generous deadlines).You also need to be aware that the Korean words are not transcribed so you will need to learn the symbols very quickly in order to do well. I confess this was the aspect that tripped me up the most. A few other things that slowed me down during the course: the Korean lettering was at times far too small and densely packed for non-native eyes to follow at natural speed; Korean sounds are difficult to differentiate (more focus on this would have been appreciated); and tests are graded but no feedback is provided (correct answers with explanations would have been great!).Final words of wisdom: enjoy the course - you have nothing to lose and everything to gain!",0,0,Svjetlana Bosanac,85929719

The next thing is that some of the explanations felt insufficient when I was doing the lessons.

A review of the particle endings learned and their differences would be appreciated too. I know it's only beginner Korean, but I think it would definitely help.

In particular, the lessons in weeks one and two are very well-paced and the explanations given in the videos are clear and concise. The teacher takes time to enunciate and to explain the pronunciations of the vocabulary used in every lesson, which is of great help since Korean pronunciation is very nuanced and hard to understand the difference between the similar-sounding sounds.As an area of improvement, I would consider reviewing the reading material since it's very scarce. It holds all the vocabulary as well as additional exercises that the student can attempt on their own before watching the videos to do corrections, however, there are no actual explanations of the grammar learned in each lesson. Particularly in weeks 3 and 4 where grammar gets a bit more complicated, the explanation in the video is not enough to truly understand what the rules are and students who learn more by understanding grammar could use a more fleshed out explanation in the reading material.

The Korean language has both formal and informal and how this class is taught is very formal. I wanted a combination of both. It doesn't also get into detail how korean sentences can be versatile. Furthermore, I took the course to get a better grip on reading and writing since that's the hardest part for me but it jumps through so quickly without offering students to learn to read in different ways. For example, children and many adults are more visual people. My Chinese course through Peking university gives you exercises with visuals as well. I believe that helps in retaining and understanding the reading element better. I expected more from Yonsei since it's a top university so a bit disappointed but it's not a bad course and like I said still useful in it's own way.

It has vocabulary, it has grammar and to start learning ways to introduce yourself and see how do you feel about this language I think it helps a lot. Because if you start with a lot of difficult grammar and stuff like that it'd maybe scare you but with little introductions about what do you do or about things you like it seems a friendly language. I'm looking for the next Yonsei's course and I hope it goes as well as this one. I recommend it to people who wants to start learning Korean.(If I had to say something bad it's that sometimes it doesn't explain exactly the grammar points. I mean, they show you how to say something but then they use another different example and don't explain you why it's different to the first one.

The pace is a little aggressive, which is fine if you take your time to learn each lesson before moving on. Language courses are not the kind where you can just listen and then take the quiz. Slow down. Practice.By week four the speakers in the audio files were speaking on a level where I was having difficulty distinguishing some of the words. In particular, the differences between the 20th and 21st of the month can be somewhat challenging for a beginning speaker of Korean. On the quizzes, I slowed down and repeated some of the audio.

The small quizzes at the end of every lecture were great to get some more listening comprehension and review what you just learned.
The only thing that could be improved in my opinion would be the work sheets, which could be structured a little better. At the moment everything is put chronologically, as in the order you learned it in the lecture, but it might ake sense for example to put all the vocabulary in one place, and not some at the beginning and some at the end .

The quizzes are hard enough but not impossible, you truly exercise what you learned in the unit.

Professor Kang for the opportunity to get acquainted with the Korean language
precisely in the way we did through the course. This course is very useful for
absolute beginners as I was. I did not know even a letter in Korean and used to
think that Korean alphabet was extremely difficult which, by the way, prevented
me from studying it. However, this course helped me to realize that “Devil is
not black as he is painted” and it is not that hard providing one will make
enough effort. Regarding the course itself, video materials were very
informative even though they normally lasted 10-12 minutes. I liked the way
professor explained themes during all 5 weeks and of course additional
materials attached after each lesson. Learning any foreign language requires A
LOT OF practice and all quizzes, short dialogues and vocabulary in this course
help me to do so. I keep studying Korean via different social networks and I
feel deliriously happy when I encounter there some words, grammar rules that
I’ve learnt thanks to this course. I highly recommend it for people who want to
start studying this beautiful language from the very beginning and considering
any free course available. It is definitely the best option! Good luck everyone!!!",0,0,Сундет Кадирбаев,59269963

Also the mixed abilities and ages in the class meant that some were pressing to move faster, while others of us would have benefitted from a more moderate place. This way I learn at my own pace, at a time suitable to me, and I have regular contact with the language during the week.
