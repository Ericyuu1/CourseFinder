64530797~COURSE!~yPY7nPziEeqNCAqNtkyr8w,1620342293487,5,0,The instructor is knowledgeable and enthusiastic about his subject.  He uses a real-world dataset (Amazon rainforest) which I found interesting.  I chose to do the examples in my own Jupyter notebook so I can easily go back and review.  I recommend this guided project for those interested in exploring climate data using Python.,0,0,Rj Forest,64530797
19232793~COURSE!~yPY7nPziEeqNCAqNtkyr8w,1614315744298,5,0,"I do not recommend taking this type of course, take one and pass it, however after a few days I have tried to review the material, and my surprise is that it asks me to pay again to be able to review the material. Of course coursera gives me a small discount for having already paid it previously.
It is very easy to download the videos and difficult to get hold of the material, but with ingenuity it is possible. Then I recommend uploading them to YouTube and keeping them private for when they want to consult (they avoid legal problems and can share with friends), then they can request a refund.
