14340688~COURSE!~du_Hx83BEeu0KQ5V9fFcUQ,1656604849588,1,0,"Very disappointed with this course.  It does not appear that anyone is actively monitoring the comments in the Discussion Forum.  In Week 4, the labs do not work and no code or data is provided, contrary to the instructions that are given.  I have reported the issues associated with the labs, and have received no response whatsoever.  The lack of code or data makes it effectively impossible to complete the peer-reviewed assigment (and therefore the course).  This is arguably the worst course that I have enrolled in at Coursera.   I will be asking for a refund.",0,0,Murray Sondergard,14340688
