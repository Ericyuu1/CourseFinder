This content is outdated, biased and not holistic!H​ow can a ""rewarded"" university teach students a full bag of crap? This should be allowed. I will give you an example: she is talking about the adaption of cryptocurrency and some reason for it, where the second reason is: you do not like centralised intermediaries for philosophical reason, because you are an libertarian and an anarchist OR third reason: you need to hide from centralised intermediaries because you are engaged in some activities. So basically you will only adapt cryptocurrency if you are an extremist or a cheater which is in contact with fraud or illegal things. WHAT THE HECK. And by the way, only in case you haven’t seen the news for about two years, Bitcoin is at its ATH of 68.000$ approaching 100.000$ and not “about 4000$” like in your videos. Get your content right!Leave alone the aspect that the content is biased and not fully represented but the way it is presented to the audience is horrible. No Graphics, no interesting way of giving information. Not even links to other resources, e.g. books, articles,… The old lady has no enthusiasm; she is probably falling asleep while ready of the slides.Embarrassing to say the least!If you really want to learn hands-on knowledge which is both theoretical and practical and will help you in the near future, go and watch some YouTube videos and do not waste one second watching these videos (and it´s free!).",0,1,Julia Ast,92525406

You are talking about the technology of the future, and all you do is present a set of boring slides without any graphics, like the ones people made in the 1980s when we had overhead projectors, and someone just reading them aloud!What was especially annoying was the screen cutting away from the slide on screen, after every sentence, to pan on the lecturer, who mostly spoke in an emotionless voice with zero modulation, and then cutting away again back to the slide for the next bullet. This made it very hard to retain, and it felt like a middle school memory game. Why not just leave the slide on screen and do a voice over most of the time? Halfway through the modules, I was quite exhasperated and somehow sat through because I had to complete the course. I got way more education and satisfaction watching a couple of youtube videos which explained all that was contained in this course, in 15-20 minutes, through impactful graphics and animation.Apologies if I have been too candid, but Coursera needs to seriously review this course if they want it to be effective.

When discussing a technology as rapidly changing as this, the content needs to be current.  (Example: Ethereum 2.0)  As near as I can guess, this set of presentations was put together in 2019.  The discussion of ""Why Cryptocurrency"" failed to offer several reasons why cryptocurrency is superior to fiat currency and gold.  I can think of eight.  I liked that CAPM, Markowitz and Sharpe were discussed.  How cryptocurrency can lower portfolio risk through diversification was not described adequately.  I don't know how important that is since, at the end of the day, cryptocurrency needs to be viewed in terms of its value as a store of value and a medium of exchange, not an investment.  (Although, I have holdings in both Bitcoin and Ethereum.  The concepts might have been communicated better with some slides that had illustrations.  They had only bulletpoints.  All that being said, there is no question that I am coming away with a much clearer understanding of Blockchain.  This is critical, of course, since cryptocurrency doesn't exist without Blockchain.
