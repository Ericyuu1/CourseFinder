Conflicting descriptions of assessment requirements.  Discussion moderators who continually referred you back to the course material which did not contain the information that people were looking for.  Before taking this course I could find only one negative review, which I dismissed as probably being a minority.  Having taken the course, I agree with that review wholeheartedly.

There is almost no connection between the experience of the lectures (and that's all the videos are - lectures that track a PowerPoint presentation) and the assignments, quizzes, etc. Reference and source materials are frequently mentioned in passing, but there is no comprehensive list of works cited anywhere. The assignments are often vaguely described and, in more than one case, were described entirely differently in different places.I have nothing good to say about this experience. You're watching a fundamentally disconnected series of mostly ad-hoc discussions of vague concepts.
