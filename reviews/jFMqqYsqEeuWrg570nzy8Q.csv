99377759~COURSE!~jFMqqYsqEeuWrg570nzy8Q,1646067344176,1,0,"Honestly, I took several courses in coursera that are similar or connected with this course and this course didn't reach my expectations.

I expect it shows how to prepare food more specifically, like making some veggies become frozen. pre-cooked the food without losing the nutrients / preserved most of the nutrients in pre-cooked food since the title is ""Cooking for busy healthy people"".

So when we are really busy, we can just open the refrigerator and reheat or stir fry the ingredients which we already prepared before.",0,2,Nico Oscar,99377759
6815629~COURSE!~jFMqqYsqEeuWrg570nzy8Q,1634819202585,1,0,"Excuse me but frying every single vegetable in butter is not healthy cooking. It might be faster than steaming/boiling, but it is certainly not healthier - or even healthy.There are better recipes on YouTube for free - and there is much more detailed content with regards to healthy eating that the superficial 1 or 2 minute videos and the external links (nothing original, nothing that the lecturers can claim as their own thoughts and work) that constitute this course.",0,7,Konstantinos Vasileiou,6815629

My passion and technique for cooking have increased. Also, I'm more conscious about cooking vegetables, sustainable seafood, and leftovers in my fridge before shopping for more ingredients.

Really interesting and you can take a lot out of it. Videos coupled with the recipes make all dishes easy to make even if you are not an experienced cook and you are just now experimenting in the kitchen. Courses of mrs. Adam like that are a must, since we are living in a world where food choices become less and less sustainable and junk food is the king in most households in the western world.
