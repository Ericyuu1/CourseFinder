Many of the programming assignments are bugged. You don't have enough opportunities to practice before the programming assignment. Most of the videos are just codes being quickly explained.

The programming assignments are really just copy and paste exercises and takes very little time to complete.  I found the applications exciting and as an intro to all the new elements of TF it is useful as a whirlwind tour.  But  apart from the tflite mobil device course which is challenging if you have never used swift/Xcode before it needed to be a bit more than just run throughs of the TF colabs.,0,0,Mark Paine,40722884

It  is a fun course with hands-on deployment on the browser, Android and  Raspberry Pi, and efficient data pipelines, tf datasets, and tf_hub  models. Given the wide coverage, it requires further dedication to dive  into the different topics. It includes four courses:

-Browser-device models with tensorflow.js: Perform inference and training using JavaScript. Convert models to json format.

-Device-based  with tensorflow.lite: Convert models to tflite format (low latency,  size and power consumption). Running models on Android, iOS, and  embedded devices.

-Data pipelines with tensorflow data services: tfds datasets and pipelines, improving data pipelines performance.

-Advanced  deployment scenarios:  Model inference over the web by server request  using Tensorflow Serving. Pretrained models with TF hub. Callbacks  during training using Tensorboard. Introduction to decentralized edge  device training with TFFederated Learning.",0,0,Juan Perez Juste Abascal,41237996
