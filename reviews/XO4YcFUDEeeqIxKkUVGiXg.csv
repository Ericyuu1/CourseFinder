5063431~COURSE!~XO4YcFUDEeeqIxKkUVGiXg,1671415999526,4,0,"This was a fun class.  I learned a lot. I feel like it really put a lot of what I learned to use and brought the material from the four courses in the specialty together.  The result was cool.  I had several “Wow!” moments along the line.  Still, I give the class four stars.  I’d give it a five, but there are some things that need improvement to get there.  First, as I’ll say here and elsewhere, if it is at all possible, use Microsoft Windows rather than Linux.  In my opinion, the course instructions should no longer recommend Linux.  I spent a couple of work days along the way attempting to get Linux to work and gave up.  Linux binaries aren’t provided by the class.  The newest version of Quartus doesn’t have Modelsim.  Modelsim is a 32-bit executable.  The NIOS II EDS is tightly integrated into an old version of Eclipse that only runs on old versions of Java (that Intel only supports under SUSE 12).  Second, the auto grader for assignments can be nonsensical and provide very limited feedback as to what you did wrong and how you can improve your grade (or learn from your mistakes).  To make matters worse, there’s no written rubric as to how points are awarded.  I had assignments that worked as specified that didn’t get full credit.  I couldn’t figure out why.   Third, the DE10-Lite is getting expensive.  It was $50 a couple years ago.  As of December 2022, it's $140 plus shipping from Taiwan from Terasic or $293 on Amazon. All that aside, I really did enjoy the work.  For a while it was an almost unhealthy obsession.  :-)",0,0,Greg Hawley,5063431
