It has been super helpful having each assignment relate to a real problem I face, and the opportunity to connect with people in a similar field helped create a support network. Working in sustainability is challenging but beneficial, and its great to have connected with people who have similar experiences and push backs. I really enjoyed the interviews - seeing people within the field of sustainability and understanding their career path has got me really excited for the future. Going forward in my current job, I feel as though I have an action plan with how to change the company for the better. Highly recommend the course. ",0,1,Sian Berkley,55156241
