The content was well delivered and engaging, as were many of the suggested readings. The resources included are also very useful to my future teaching.
One aspect I will point out is that most of the content comes from an American context. While this is still very useful, if you are, like me, coming to this course from somewhere else you will need to take this into account and apply your learning appropriately.",0,1,Eoin Patrick Smyth,83542470
