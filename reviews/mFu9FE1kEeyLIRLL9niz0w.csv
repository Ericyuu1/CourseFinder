I want to thank you all instructors for all that you are releasing in these courses, especially these ones that I have completed.  I really want to know, and I will continue to read and read again until I am on top of it. But I want to plead with the writing team to please try and proofread before posting. Although English is my second language, and I am not too good but then then puntuations  are very key because they can make a lot of difference in what one reads, and also helps one to underastand better. But above all,  you are great! Thank you immensely,",0,0,Mr. Ayodele Aanuoluwapo,21935533

57709064~COURSE!~mFu9FE1kEeyLIRLL9niz0w,1656898012286,5,0,I have done multiple online courses through coursera. Very few courses incorporate labs into their curriculum. I was pleasantly surprised by all the labs requirring me to get some hands-on knowledge on how to use the software on my own in the future. All the course material is relevant and in use today. Really enjoyed this one. So much co that I was looking forward to every test and every lab walkthrough. ,0,0,Lisa Thabisile Meiring,57709064
