It is essential viewing for any educator in the United States today, as so many problems with meeting the needs of students with dyslexia are stymied by educators (teachers, principals, board of education members, superintendents, curriculum specialists, reading and writing interventionists, counselors, school psychologists) who lack training, who have been mistrained, or who have out-of-date training, or who otherwise hold unscientific and false ideas about dyslexia. The only major shortcoming in the course is that it does not give any advice for dealing with K-12 school districts that refuse to identify or serve students with dyslexia, a common problem.",0,0,Erik Macki,121015626
