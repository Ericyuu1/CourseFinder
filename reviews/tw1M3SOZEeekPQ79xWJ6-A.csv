66204497~COURSE!~tw1M3SOZEeekPQ79xWJ6-A,1668852766622,4,0,"Surprising depth of material.  I especially appreciated the on-location videos of various sites in Spain, and the behind-the-scenes access to museums and historical collections that most tourists would never be able to see.  I found Prof. D'Avila's approach to be fair and balanced, with an objectivity that's hard to maintain around often polemic subjects such as religion and race.  While I learned a ""history"" of Spain in high school, it basically focused on the ""good"" monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella who drove the Arabs from Spain.  I learned nothing about the circumstances which had placed Arab culture in Spain, nothing about the centuries of Arab presence, and no mention of the multicultural history of Spain was ever made.  So this was, in many ways, an exciting course of discovery -- so many completely new  aspects of history to experience.  D'Avila's presentation is what I would call ""integrative"" -- relating all the parts to each other as an organic whole.  This is so different from the fragmented, ""atomizing"" bits of history I learned in school.  My first exposure to the idea that history could be integrative, synthetic (ie synthesizing elements into a whole) came when I read Fernand Braudel's ""L'Identité de la France""(in French, 3 volumes, beginning with Vol 1, Les  hommes et les choses, starting with France before the year 1000).  If you haven't encountered Braudel's work, and enjoy the wholistic approach to history, much of his work is translated into English:  just Google Fernand Braudel on history.From the moment I got my teeth into Braudel's work, I wished I had been exposed to history in such an integrative way.  This course met that expectation.  Prof. D'Avila does a good job of making a complex subject understandable and relatable.",0,0,Garum,66204497

I was not convinced by the editing of the videos, unless they were interviews.

I spent years trying to find a course on it,and I couldn't really afford to take another degree. So, I went back to reading anything I could on this topic,including travelling to Spain on flamenco and sight seeing holidays, L'institut du Monde Arabe for more literature, etc,etc.   Just by accident,I found this course ,after enrolling on several online education sites. This course has a lot of material, videos, extracts, quizzes, forums and analysing and reviewing artefacts,and listening to Andalusi/ Sephardic music,reading poetry etc.  I enrolled as an interested learner but it was so interesting,with things I hadn't known about,before,I upgraded.   Yes,if you want to get a lot of it,you have to put in the work. The quizzes were a mixture of medium difficulty to challenging: they really kept me on my toes.   I  learned a lot about honing my skills as a historian : evaluating ,reviewing,reflecting on historical artefacts, with their contexts and significance.  The videos have transcripts/ subtitles facilities. You can work at your own pace,within the time given.  By the end of the course,I had a far deeper and detailed ,joined up understanding of history,politics,art,culture/ anthropology of co existence in Moorish/ Medieval Spain.  I shall certainly enrol on the Deciphering Secrets series. The main lecturer,Roger Louis Martinez- Davila is very enthusiastic, encouraging and dedicated lecturer.
