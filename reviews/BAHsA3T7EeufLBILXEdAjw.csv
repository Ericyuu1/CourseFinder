11292668~COURSE!~BAHsA3T7EeufLBILXEdAjw,1647248075656,3,0,"Greetings, Although the course included a substantial amount of great information, I was disappointed that I received a low grade on the final peer assignment without any feedback at all. The assignments I had reviewed from a content perspective had nothing to with what was required in the assignment and were likely just uploaded to get a certificate. This made the lack of feedback on my assignment  (and low grade) particularly annoying because I had followed the assignment directions quite closely. There was also no easy to find link to provide feedback (to the instructor or course developers) on an assignment. It would have greatly improved the final assignment if a template had been provided rather than having to develop your own. That ate up a considerable amount of time. I have been using Coursera for over 7 years now, have been a positive brand ambassador and now also a stock holder, but now after this certificate and experience, will look for other providers that offer higher quality experience and better feedback mechanisms. Thank you.     ",0,4,Mike Wilson,11292668
