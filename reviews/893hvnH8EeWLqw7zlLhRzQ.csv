You can give 15 points or zero points, forcing you to choose whether to pass or fail your classmate for a mediocre but technically acceptable answer, or an insightful but incomplete answer.

Overall I have come away with a great understanding of how to gather and develop the news in a wide range of situations. I have signed up for the next course in the specialization.

Totally fascinated by the course as I intend to write articles in the long run.   I was many years ago a commercial photographer, however my pictures seem to tell a story and they are not photoshoped.  So its envitable that i could not set the world on fire in that realm, but with the journalism course, I can see a way forward. Joe Grim has to have a mention just simply his saying thank you at the end of each lecture, its not something you see from people these days, then there are some very interesting personalities teaching in this course.
