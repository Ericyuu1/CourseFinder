Thus, talking about some kind of sympathy towards russians is impossible when they are killing thousands of civilians, raping women and children and pillaging cities in Ukraine just as I write these words. The course should be reviewed and in many aspects fixed and changed. The most obvious point here is words about the civil war in Ukraine. Just pure nonsense.

However, I found certain parts difficult to understand and some of the points brought in do not fit the lecture. In ""Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact"", Prof Kenez brought in the Finnish-Russian War where the Russian losses were 6x that of Finnish ones though the link to the actual pact is quite unclear. In ""German Invasion of the Soviet Union"", the telling is quite unclear and I had to read the transcript a few times to make sense of the military history behind Germany's invasion of Russia. Around 11:06, he says that even if the Nazis captured Moscow, they would have lost the war but doesn't explain why. This will then make you think that the Russians somehow managed to halt the Nazis but around 11:49, he says that Stalin attempted a counterattack which wasn't quite successful.

very much Professor Peter Kenez for the instructive and interesting course
which I have almost finished only the essay and reviewing peers are remaining.
I wish I had been taught the history of Russia up till the time of me going to primary
school when I was young.Indeed, the
Russian people have suffered a lot and it is no wonder that they see Putin as
their rescuer, whether he really is there rescuer will be shown in the future.
I am not very optimistic.On the
other hand, the communist system which created shortages asked for corruption
and I think that not one Russian has not misused the system in the past, it has
become part of life. That a few people, the oligarchs exploited the new
situation is in no way defendable but was the outcome of a rotten system.What I
missed in the course is any talk about the Vory, the Russian mafia which was
there even in Stalin’s period and which is at the moment in command in Russia

“Shock therapy” I think the Vory should have been mentioned because of the

Professor did an excellent job in opening various aspects of such a complex topic. My only concern was that his English was a tiny bit broken and he spoke quite slowly (so I watched everything on 1.25x speed). All in all it was a great experience!,0,1,Julia Odegova,35195616

It took a video or two for me to get used to seeing the professor talk to the camera, but once I got used to that, I really began to enjoy Dr. Kenez's style. He managed to cover a lot of history while still giving enough details to help student understand why events occurred as they did. Also, I like the fact that he told you when he offered an opinion. More than once, he said, ""In my opinion"" or ""I believe"" rather than presenting his opinion as a fact. If he had another course, I would take it because he did such a great job.

Peter Kenez has so much knowledge on this subject, and his presentation and treatment of the information was fascinating.
