When he states, ""I and many other scholars believe"" such and such claims, he is telling me I should take the word of people in academia that share his beliefs, and not listen to those who state the Biblical writings are inspired.  I felt I was being talked down to, just like when a person says, ""I don't vote for that political party, because everyone knows they lie, cheat, steal, eat donuts,..."" Also, when the interviews are done, the professor seems far too concerned with talking over the invited guest in an effort to steer the conversation in one particular path.  Asking questions and then trying to answer them himself, not showing respect to learned people in their fields of study, is rude and uninformative.  ",0,0,Peter Brown,94025933

However, I did watch all of the lectures, take all of the quizzes and, in addition, I did read Prof. Wright's book on David and Caleb.  It is quite a lot of information to absorb, however I do actually plan to read more of the course materials and maybe also some of the books by some of the academics and theologians whom he interviewed.  Prof. Wright is clearly very passionate about his topic and he is also a very good teacher.  I loved his clarity, his broad mindedness and also his erudition.  I also loved the fact that he has designed this course to be accessible to a diverse range of students, both in terms of one's level of experience with biblical texts and also in terms of one's religious upbringing and beliefs. For instance, I was raised Episcopalian and tend toward agnosticism, but nonetheless do have a real interest in and curiosity about the Bible. Prof. Wright is in no way doctrinaire, but rather presents the material and  his own interpretations of it as food for further thought.  Covid is raging, so I have now taken several courses on Coursera simply in order to stay sane.  So far, this is the one that has been the best taught and the most interesting.

In this way, the process of identity disintegration to which the people of Israel are relegated becomes the very condition of their existence as such to the extent that biblical authors institute an interpretation of the reality that turns exile and political-military defeat into assumptions of the choice of the Hebrews to participate in the covenant established with the patriarch Abraham and whose terms determine the relationship of God with his descendants, demanding, then, the construction of a pan-Israelite identity,  namely, an identity capable of covering all family groups that, in a state of dispersion throughout the diaspora, lose the ethical-religious and economic-social bonds that make up a nation and need to restore them through the concept of God, known as Yahweh , is the only historical-cultural legacy that has the possibility of restoring the collective consciousness of the nation.",0,1,Luiz Carlos Mariano da Rosa,25866794
