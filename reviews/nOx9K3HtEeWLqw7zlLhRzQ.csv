31968149~COURSE!~nOx9K3HtEeWLqw7zlLhRzQ,1524577136992,2,0,"Although this did bring items together nicely it did not add much new if any content from Modules 1 and 4.  This is especially annoying as since this is now being done on a time period this course was not offered in the same cadence as the others so I could not open the last assignment when done with the sections 1-4.  Then I come to see this assignment is just the module 1-4 questions repeated, and you are supposed to edit based on prior feedback which is nice if I received much of any but I did not so that means it was basically copy and pasting the assignments from before to get the certificate.",0,0,Joshua Valenti,31968149

Knowing each law, regulatory path and steps for the development of a medical product was very enriching for me. The instructors were very good at their teachings.  ",0,0,Massiel Rivera,65285755
