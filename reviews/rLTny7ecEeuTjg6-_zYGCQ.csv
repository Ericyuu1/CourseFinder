81021389~COURSE!~rLTny7ecEeuTjg6-_zYGCQ,1638109124044,1,0,Sâ€‹ave your 10 bucks and watch some videos on youtube on the subject. Poorly prepared project. Instructor does not explain the outputs that the function produce. I am under the impression he does not know how to explain The Gap Statistics output. And one more thing: this is NOT an intermediate level. This is a beginner's level.  Very disappointed.,0,0,Oksana Buynitzky,81021389
