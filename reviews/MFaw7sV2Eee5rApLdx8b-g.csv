Stopped after completing most of Week 1.I might've missed it, but I didn't think you needed to have a programming background to take this  course (if this is true, then none of what I'm about to say applies).  Although I love the teacher's passion and dedication, unfortunately he doesn't teach in a way to builds upon fundamentals. He ""shows"" rather than ""teach."" It's more like he's showing different things that it can do, rather than build fundamentals and explain the process he's showing.  This isn't a value judgement about the instructor, just my experience with the way the course is taught.
The first few sections of Week 1 were fine. Introducing little bits of fundamentals. So far so good, although small moments where I felt a bit of confusion with  the extremely elaborate and detailed examples he gave (for example, arguments/parameters in a sub.....how about we get used to even typing out sub a bit more, before we start feeding it parameters?). But by around the 6th video, and definitely the 8th video (Declaration/scope), it goes off the rails.

This Specialisation was incredibly useful to me as a novice programmer.  Unlike some of the other free/low cost online content out there on VBA this course is well-structured and rigorous enough to actually gain a solid foundation in programming concepts, and more importantly to be able to apply the material to real world situations.  I've only just completed the course but have already created a couple of macro-based report collation tools at work that have been very well received since they save time and improve accuracy.  I have a couple of other bigger projects I'm now planning at work, which have long been an ambition of mine but out of my league until now. The course really is quite challenging (if you have experience in another program it will probably come much easier for you!) and one really does have to think and try things out in the assignments and later projects to get an outcome - which is important since that's what it'll be like writing VBA in the wild!  The video content is very well presented and well-thought out and Charlie's passion for maths, programming and creative solutions really shone through.  The content is structured logically, with a good progression in difficulty moving along the weeks and parts.Another great thing about this course is that rather than get bogged down in the minutiae of every VBA term/syntax it focuses on broad programming concepts such as loops, iteration, arrays and debugging/problem solving. So I'm now feeling much more confident to get into learning other languages I have in my future learning goals",0,0,Jessica Haxen,65619285

I have studied vba before, did other online courses, but this one stands out. Thanks to the quizzies and assignments the material in the lessons gets stuck in ones head a lot easier, than in other courses I have done.
One criticism though: I have only completed the mandatory 4 weeks from part 1. I intend to do week 5 as well, though I am not certain I will make it until deadline. I checked the other two parts of the specialization and as far as I can tell, EVENTS are completely neglected/left out, eventhough they are a very importnat part of automating things with vba. So if I am not mistaken and they are not inculded, the whole specialization only will get 4 stars. Part 1 has earned 5  though, they are well deserved.",0,0,Istvan Kovacs,41102531

34420064~COURSE!~MFaw7sV2Eee5rApLdx8b-g,1564348653758,5,0,"Programming  VBA for Excel requires three skills; knowledge of the application object model, knowledge of Excel, and knowledge of programming. Even skilled programmers familiar with Excel can be overwhelmed when tying all three skills together so creating an introduction class for the novice is a challenge. This course succeeds at not over whelming the student.This course takes a balanced approached and gently guides the student into a dance with the subject matter using some very interesting techniques and examples from typical engineering problems. It covers the right amount of instruction for the VBA editor and the interaction of data and variables between the editor and Excel.  It covers functions and subroutines, the scope and types of variables at a useful enough level, without getting too deep. Because the instructor is an engineer he includes several simple but powerful numerical methods and the use of both Solver and GoalSeek into the course. Since I am an engineer and enjoy numerical methods I especially like this and would enjoy a course that might be described as “Numerical Recipes in VBA” .I would recommend this course to novices seeking an introduction through to experienced users wanting a deeper understanding and foundation for future work in VBA for Excel.",0,6,Terry Harris,34420064

Charlie is a very good instructor, he makes every step of the learning curve seem manageable. His quizzes and assignments cover all material, so make sure you know it all before doing them!

I was looking for something exactly like this: simple, useful and well structured. I think the course is perfect for small projects and daily solutions in the office as well. The magic of VBA/Excel is it can be applied for most of the knowledge areas. I would recommend for people who want automate repetitive tasks and optimize their work!  Great job Charlie!
