1526437~COURSE!~-YdYt3Q6EeWxvQr3acyajw,1563498323211,3,0,"Feedback in the forums was sparse and often required a long wait time to get a response from an AI - if at all. Glitches regarding certain tools made completing particular projects difficult, and solutions were not always implemented to help students navigate these difficulties easily. The specialization is great, but this particular course has been the most frustrating for me.",0,3,Evan Wright,1526437
2152278~COURSE!~-YdYt3Q6EeWxvQr3acyajw,1514311047625,3,0,"This course contains a good amount of information for intermediate GIS users, but it repeats too much material from the previous courses and the presentation of the material could sometimes be organized better. The remote sensing section is actually information-dense and overwhelming, and I'm disappointed that spatial statistics wasn't covered in more detail. Overall, I think the people who would get the most out of this class are those who are interested specifically in learning basic information about remote sensing and/or automation in ArcGIS.As a sidenote, while the instructor does a very good job of simplifying concepts that not all students may have experience with, he for some reason feels the need to reassure his audience that he isn't going to delve into the difficulties of math. I think he should mention the bounds of the class without implying that math is prohibitively difficult; people only think math is hard because others make it seem so, and we shouldn't discourage people from learning more.",0,2,April Hersey,2152278
4925740~COURSE!~-YdYt3Q6EeWxvQr3acyajw,1471816007577,3,0,"Whilst the material in the course is fine (although repetitious in places), the pacing is fairly poor.Ultimately, there are three things covered by this course: a brief overview of remote sensing, hands-on raster classification and hands-on work with Model Builder work (using hydrology as an example framework). These then combine into the final submitted assignment. Many of the remaining lecture topics don't particularly link in to anything you'll be doing and are just ""for interest's sake"". Also, a lot of time is spent on the more intuitive aspects of Model Builder, but little to none is allotted to troubleshooting and the less intuitive aspects (for example, how to incorporate variables throughout a model or other issues with generalising a custom tool built within Model Builder). If taking the course, be aware that the final submitted assignment requires formulating your own research question and unless you're already working in the field, can necessitate a significant amount of literature review for even the given example research questions. The gap in expectations and assistance is more of a chasm.Unless you have the better part of a week free to commit to the course, it is advised that you skip ahead to the final assignment immediately and spread it over the full four weeks, spending the first week formulating the question, the second producing the classified raster and the third the model builder model, including any research necessary for this step. This gives the last week to produce products for submission or continue the work from the third week.Hopefully in upcoming repeat sessions of the course, pacing will be improved, the grading rubric provided before final submission for the sake of transparency and clarity, and a little more guidance and actual feedback available in the forums, which are largely deserted at this point.",0,11,Paul Evans,4925740
