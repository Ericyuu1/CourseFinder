Kevin challenged me based on the <<CONTENT>> of the course and I learned the content as a result of being challenged in that way. G​ary.. oh Gary.. your content is lifeless in comparison and the challenge from your course is based on the <<QUIZ FORMAT>> and how easy it is to lose my patience when the only way to pass the module exams are to write down every single question that comes up. Of course, the answers you submit (because the majority of questions have you select all that apply) get covered up BUT don't give you partial points for the Select All Applicable questions.It took four or five attempts for me to pass Module 2. There are 18 questions on the exam and yet I have a list of 36 questions from the test bank pool. Good luck on what to tell Sharon, I have no clue what to tell her and I'm pretty sure that no one else does either. If I could give this course 0 Stars then I would. This course doubts my ability to be stubborn and power through to the end of this specialization as Gary makes his reapperance in Course 4.",0,0,Katrina Valaike,104616938

45659~COURSE!~0czyKe-LEeWLaBLI8fdMlw,1613731535832,1,0,I am rating this course as one star only because of following reasons:1) Quizzes don't get displayed correctly. This is the worst part of the course. 2) Several ultra short videos have been joined to create a lecture on a particular topic - which is quite annoying to watch. 3) Instructor is not articulate enough to explain the concept in lucid manner.  He says same and same things again in different way. There seems to be loose connection between what instructor teaches and kinds of questions/quizzes given either during the lecture or in practice quizzes. ,0,0,Pankaj Dwivedi,45659

11152927~COURSE!~0czyKe-LEeWLaBLI8fdMlw,1471836505911,1,0,"This course was a complete joke. Many practice quiz questions and even test questions had wrong answers marked as right so you had to re-write test over and over until you guessed which one of the wrong answers was right. Also, there was a theme of lazily worded questions and answers throughout the entire course. There is always a way to write in non ambiguous ways, it just takes some effort.  Very frustrating to decipher the lazily worded questions. Someone should have proof read this course. I feel like an idiot for paying for it. ",0,12,Daniel Carlson,11152927

21110896~COURSE!~0czyKe-LEeWLaBLI8fdMlw,1497860499349,2,0,"I hate giving this course a low course. The concepts here and principles are exactly what i enrolled for, and this course was handled poorly. The explanations to the quizzes were done lazily. The language used was too robotic and some module questions just do not make sense.It was so frustrating because I had high hopes considering how course 1 and course 2 was delivered so well: the real-life examples were actual interviews from real entrepreneurs who we can relate to, an actual auditor who gives insight on what can be found in a statement.This course was barely visual. some boring presentations and the mentor is very distracting. he was so stiff. he was too dependent on his cue card/idiot board at the back of the camera and mentor's eyes looking at his cue cards all the time, with not so much of a personal input. we might as well have read the cue cards ourselves.The examples given in the lecture are too simple and the questions given in the module are not easily relatable to. I hope the mentor is reminded that students have very pragmatic reasons on why we enrolled in online courses in the first place. We are not Accountancy majors/undergrads, we are simple entrepreneurs who need to understand how to make rational decisions and thus our limited accounting foundations are very limited. I am an engineering major and used to be a Calculus teacher before so I cannot say that I am not privy with numbers. But i need to see how the accounting concepts and principles translate into the math and that's what I was missing.There is very limited interaction, feedback or questioning as compared to a live classroom experience, so I really hope that he could have exerted more effort in trying to teach management accounting for dummies like me.

The explanation has not been upto the mark as compared to the first 2 courses in the specialization cause earlier they actually consulted real business people to portray the concepts of accounting in a lay man's terms which is quite easier for the students to grasp; in this course the faculty just used a tele-prompter or just read through the presentations.
