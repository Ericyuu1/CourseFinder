49043961~COURSE!~MhJ8a3L_Eem98Ar36Sm7-A,1582300715937,1,0,"El curso debería ser por lo menos doblado al inglés en su totalidad. Leer subtítulos en inglés todo el tiempo y con una redacción que contiene errores hace al curso poco atractivo y bastante cansado. El curso no habla de las herramientas tecnológicas o plataformas que se utilizan para clases online, como por ejemplo Zoom, Jitsi, etc. Las pruebas ""Homework"" contienen errores en forma y contenido. Algunas preguntas o alternativas de respuesta están mal elaboradas y/o redactadas y cada examen por lo menos tiene una pregunta que no tiene respuesta correcta, a pesar de haber revisado los videos y notas varias veces. Es una lástima, pero no recomendaría este curso a nadie.

44613033~COURSE!~MhJ8a3L_Eem98Ar36Sm7-A,1582300661228,1,0,"The course offered very little of everything it says an online class should have.  The translation to English is poor and the tests have many mistakes:  questions that are not clear or are too general and in most of them there was a question with no correct answer.  Additionally, feedback was never provided in order to learn what my mistakes were.   For the cost, I expected a lot more from this course and feel completely unsatisfied with the outcome.

One thing that still leaves a small hole for the next improvement is the language barrier since the course is originally set up in Chinese, thus it is very essential to establish the English translation completely and properly both in video narration and PowerPoint slides in the video.",0,0,Didik Hariyanto,53057518

In all I  have learnt a lot irrespective of the challenges . Thank you.",0,0,Sandra Aidoo,68229620
