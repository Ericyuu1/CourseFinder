There are a lot of mini lectures, given by different instructors with varying degrees of quality, and what I noticed is that the course didn't have a defined common thread. Many of the lecturers have a rather poor pronunciation, which makes it difficult to follow properly the topics. However, some theoretical aspects about the physical mechanisms of climate change, climate change modeling and the impacts of that change on glaciers and montainous areas in general are useful.",0,0,CRISTIAN ALEJANDRO USMA ROJAS,47945233

2483715~COURSE!~wF-tFF1yEeesyA7p9Q1Ckg,1612865965144,4,0,"Thank you for this course, it is very useful for understanding the risks of climate change, the risk management and the vulnerability of the mountain systems and water ecosystems. At times, it's difficult to understand the English of the presenters, but this is also understandable as they are not native speakers but teachers and researchers with a lot of expertise. I believe the course could be better structured as the chapters didn't always seem to be connected, or some of them had very similar/repeated information. I suggest to include some practical exercises every week, so the students can practice the newly learned methods and info. Also, many of the slides have too much info on one page, which is not always fully visible and the speaker is not talking about it.  So these slides are very heavy and give the student the impression that h/she doesn't really understand. An example would be the Korean case study. The links to the readings (4.11, 4.12 and 4,13) are now working. Also, the quality of the audio of the call between Prof. J. Balsiger and Dr. Ingold on social network analysis is very low and cannot really be properly understood. I am grateful for the opportunity to take this course for free and I thank everyone who got involved. The course has opened a whole new world for me and I am very interested in this field, I will try to focus more on climate change in my professional life. ",0,0,zoeluca,2483715
63111186~COURSE!~wF-tFF1yEeesyA7p9Q1Ckg,1592211437268,4,0,"Climate change will likely modify seasonal and overall water availability and, as a result, there will be increased competition for water. Climate change in the mountain regions studied in this course are leading to modifications in quantity and timing of water resources that have potentially significant ramifications for water governance and management. The investigations on the future changes in both precipitation and temperature extremes showed that the changes might be different in sign and magnitude at different temporal scales. Awareness of this problem is increasing, hopefully this new momentum will be sustained over time. Indeed, it was great course to learn and it will surely benefit the water mangers to cope with such challenges.",0,0,Dr. Syed Muzzamil Hussain Shah,63111186

The teachers have accents that can be difficult to understand, and all the lessons from Dr Rohrer are pointless, as he doesn't explain anything. He talks about a method or a concept, but merely reads the slides without explaining anything about the formulas or the results. Also, his slow and monotone tone doesn't help at all making the lessons any more intersting. I really think his courses should be done again, because as it is right now, it's quite useless and doesn't teach anything.I apologise for this harsh review, but I honestly think this should be said so changes can me made.The other modules were good, althought i thought the exam questions were quite difficult in comparison to the courses.Best regards",0,2,Mariana Martins Eduardo,40341581
