The final ""optoinal"" video ended when she clearly had no idea how to fix the scale bar issues. The fact this is a chargeable course is laughable. ",0,0,James Solan,1056409

The task was well-defined, while the instructor's explanations were generally clear and understandable. The main issue I encountered was in the (optional) final task of the project where certain steps appear to be wrong or skipped over.",0,0,Eddie Chua,2203599
