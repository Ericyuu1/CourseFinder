63202749~COURSE!~ArkZf8f1Eei2rA7PIuPbSg,1604108977406,2,0,"I had a lot of hope with this course but was sadly disappointed. The course content is all over the place and does not follow a structure or a flow. It talks about groupers in week 2, and talks on ETL in week  3, again brings risk stratification and some modelling concept in week 4 but linkages are missing.My suggestion think how an analytics practitioner should follow a methodology and take him through the steps. It should start with SEMMA concept and take a practitioner through the steps likeS
: what data is needed , concept and concept mapping, understand flow, input and
outputE:
explore
:
descriptive and visualizations M: Modify:
bring here concepts of grouper algorithms,
risk adjustmentM
: Talk here on predictive models, regressions, supervised and unsupervised learnings and risk stratification strategiesA:  Talk about how you analyze output, how you train your learning setShow with use causes scenarios of handling Fraud, Risk Adjustments and Risk Stratification.",0,4,Debopam Raha,63202749
