I understand it may be to teach those who don't know this stuff, but this should not be a application requirement to a school for any reason. Additionally, this course pushes the bullshit liberal left-wing political agenda rather than actually teaching about the history of the First Nations. The UofA, being an educational institution,  should be ashamed of prioritizing the political agenda rather than prioritizing the education of their students. Apart from being a colossal waste of my time, the last major reason this course is stupid is that it is required to apply for a program that doesn't even relate to the subject.

9602970~COURSE!~jYd91UquEeWpQA4vMed_oQ,1511225127312,1,0,"There are several reasons why I rated this course as being poor.  First, the presentation style does not make use of the capabilities of the medium, namely a significant (perhaps 70 to 80%) portion of the course is just lecturing.   There are flashes of material on the screen behind the presenter but, most of the time, there is no specific discussion of the picture, diagram or map.   The course would be enhanced significantly by using videos, real interviews (rather than just having the interviewee speak about the topic just like a lecturer), and by really incorporating graphics into the presentation.   My second reason is that the material is presented in a very superficial manner.   I realize that this is an introductory course but the course organizers/presenters need to go in depth into a few of the examples rather than just quickly going over them.    Thirdly, there is very limited resource material given and the access to that material is not very user friendly.    For example, if one wanted to get more information on a  particular treaty, it would be helpful to have the reference to that directly incorporated into the course notes so that one could click on the reference and bring up an article with more details.

24692091~COURSE!~jYd91UquEeWpQA4vMed_oQ,1497461096072,1,0,"This was my first experience with a MOOC and perhaps will be my last.  I suspect courses like this are a large part of the reason that universities are losing both credibility and relevance in the eyes of the public and employers.  The complete lack of objectivity presented in a so-called academic course was appalling.  By week four the narrative had become so one sided and superficial that it became difficult to maintain any belief in the content of the following lessons.  The lectures were so steeped in SJW tropes and what passes for left-leaning politics that the quiz questions could typically be answered based on the simple premise of what make Aboriginal people look the best and the Western worldview the worst.  The quiz questions themselves were some of the most poorly conceived and written that I've seen across almost a decade of post-secondary education and the presenters were completely devoid of charisma and style making for dull viewing of topics that were presented in a manner that could almost be considered dishonest.The forums appeared to be the most valuable component of the course however those quickly degraded into what looked like chorus of consent, likely because the overall narrative of the course provided little room for divergent views.  My own forum comments were not responded to by the course professors despite asking for clarification and other posters were clearly here to have their own views confirmed, not challenged, and made that evident through their own posts and unwillingness to consider challenging ideas.Overall I felt the course lacked any real academic integrity.  Sitting through the lectures felt more like an indoctrination attempt that education.  The content was so shallow that the course was more akin to propaganda than coursework.  The only factor that would allow me to give even one star was the somewhat improved quality of the guest presenters, some who gave a more even handed approach to the material.  This was perhaps the least critical course I have ever taken part in.  Even critical theory and methodology needs to be critiqued to have any intellectual value and that did not occur here.  Fortunately my employer has covered the small cost of the certification.  As someone who works directly with Aboriginal people, and has for a decade, and educates others on Aboriginal topics, worldview, and culture, I am disappointed to say that this course actually lowered my interest in Aboriginal issues and being a so-called ally.  This course seemed determined to undermine Canadian values and instil a sense of unwarranted guilt in the participants, likely justified as ""unsettling"" the settler.  The process was so heavy handed and obvious however that any possible positive outcome from the message was distorted.

90149345~COURSE!~jYd91UquEeWpQA4vMed_oQ,1628275600578,2,0,"Here's a tip for people creating courses: Use the media to actually teach rather than distort.There were so many instances where glib statements were made and not justified by evidence. In several instances, the statements jarred so strikingly with the material being presented that I had to pause the video to look up the details before proceeding. In every case it turned out the statement was either a lie or a gross distortion of what other sources say.Here's another tip for people creating courses: when listing your sources in your course notes, assume people will want to look them up and read them.The sources made for fascinating reading on just how limited the research into this course was. This is shocking given it comes from a Faculty of Native Studies at a university most conveniently located in Canada to invite interviews with many tribespeople and gather evidence that can be presented in a much more complete manner rather than just condensing it in the first video before moving on to topics of grievance and activism for the other videos.Here's another tip for people creating course: try to hide your agenda a bit better where you have one.The first video in each module was a fascinating insight to Indian customs, culture and 'ways of knowing' (this is why I am rating this course with two stars rather than one: there was some actual learning in it). Then the videos moved on to just brow-beat everyone non-native and stir up activism without stating why other than to foment outrage. This was particularly evident in the module quizzes, which were an obvious attempt to re-interpret course notes with meaning not imbued in the original presentations and coerce students to interpret course notes in a more militant manner.Here's another tip for people creating courses: make the tests tests of knowledge not a means to inculcate.A good test shows the student has taken the facts in and rewards them for retention and understanding, not to present striking new interpretations that must be answered correctly to gain marks. As the course went on and the amount of actual culture and history on display dwindled, more and more time was given over to radical reinterpretations of what the ancient culture must have been and using that as a basis to encourage uprising. The word 'Activism' was introduced far more regularly in later modules and the tests seemed to want to show the students knew how to use activism the best, as well as introducing the concept of 'social justice' (not a happy term to use to white settlers who battled the scourge of Soviet Communism - from where that term hails). Here's some reading for you: ""Black Is Beautiful, Communism Is Not"" by Yuri Bezmenov a.k.a. Tomas Schuman https://archive.org/details/1985BlackIsBeautifulCommunismIsNot.Lastly, it was [un]fortunate timing that I was reading Tom Bingham's ""The Rule of Law"" at the same time as taking the module on Indigenous law and governance. Don't ever tell me that indigenous law - where the accused must plead guilty before restitution can be made - is in any way superior to a system that presumes innocence until proven guilty.Oh, and you might want to rethink describing 'governance' correctly in one module before completely redefining it in the most incorrect manner possible in a later module. That kind of inconsistency looks deliberate and is not something to be 'forgiven' as you ask in the last video.This course could have been a genuine joy and a true learning experience. Instead I feel grubby from being encouraged to become an activist....and I'm still not much more educated about what the culture of Indigenous people is. I got more information out of ""The Adventures and Sufferings of John R. Jewitt"" the memoir of a British armourer taken slave by the Maquinna of Nootka Sound on Vancouver Island for nearly three years before he escaped.What were their regional diets, how was migration undertaken, why was there no written language, why was even stonemasonry not invented, why did the peoples not interact with the much larger and more successful Central American civilizations, what other stories were used to pass on intergenerational knowledge and what are the key themes to be able to know how to interpret them?",0,2,Alex Ogle,90149345

Very biased dialogue leaning to the hardship of the indigenous (First Nation) community.

University academics are fine but they have the burden of assimilation to overcome in presenting their material.  It was a good start to a very complex topic; but it should have built up to a meaningful conclusion and some real issues.  The arts section was good but probably would have been better placed in lesson 2.  This would have then allowed time to develop the issues and bring in the complexity of traditional mindsets, values, truths of survival, wisdom of land based knowledge and mutual benefit.  Teaching of the grandfathers, the grandmother clans and the community councils were minimized, unfortunately.

Two examples are: Module 12 question about improvement policy gaps for urban Indigenous residents, the text notes ""permanent Indigenous affairs committees"" while the correct answer referenced subcommittees. Committees and subcommittees are obviously related but also different.  The other is Module 10, PINAI, the text indicates that Alex Javier thinks of Bill Reid as a member of the group but it is not explicitly stated that he is (is he?).  The answer included both Bill Reid and one other artist so the user doesn't have the info needed to actually answer the question and has to guess a bit (I suppose I could have Googled it).

However what I gather from this is that the indigenous community want to have special compensations and exemptions. In a society it does not work it becomes chaos. Tradition and culture are very important to all, but granting individual groups special exemptions benefits no one. What I got from this course is that indigenous people want exemptions and compensation for past errors. But in what form?A society must agree to work together as a unit or like paddling a canoe, if both people are not paddling in the same direction nothing is accomplished.

Canada were developed as a nation of many different peoples, including the Indigenous Peoples.

This course presented the one side, but I had expected to learn more of the broader picture.  I am very aware from the media today of the concerns of the Indigenous People.  I believe that a presentation of both sides of a story is the only way to make progress on an item of concern.  I had thought that a course of this caliber from the U of A would give me a better view of the whole historical perspective.  I did not find this.  I recently read the book ""Indian In The Cabinet"" by Jody Wilson-Raybould.  A very good book.  While it dealt mostly with her time in the Cabinet, and forced removal, she did hint at broader issues for the Indigenous People that still needed to be addressed.  That is what inspired me to take this course, as I wanted to get more historical background.  I did not get it here, so I guess I need to continue my search for that broader historical background.  As a Canadian, I am very interested in finding ways to make this great country of ours an even better place for all of our people.  The strength of our country is in our people, all of our people.  My overall rating of the course is 3/5 because I did not find the balanced content that I had imagined might exist in it.

I have an undergraduate degree in history, and although I haven't pursued further formal studies in that area, I have read Canadian history my entire life and consider myself a life long learner. In reviewing this course, I have tried to take a historiographical perspective, viewing it as one of many accounts and perspectives on the history of Canada, and especially western Canada. In that regard, I don't consider it a definitive account, but one to be considered in the ongoing mix of interpretations of our complex and still evolving society. The course is decidedly one-sided, but I did not expect otherwise. As part of the so-called ""settler"" community, there is a clear attempt to make me feel responsible for the transgressions and unintended consequences of our forefathers, without acknowledging many of us have forefathers who were also oppressed and dispossessed by the same colonial masters in the 19th century. They arrived in Canada at the same time with less than most treaty aboriginals were provided through their treaties. Our ancestors came here to claim a new life and move forward, not to retreat backwards into a mythical idyllic lifestyle. Sorry, but this is the message I get from the course... there is no way forward other than land claims and lawsuits... that is no way to build a society.

It's bright and colourful and the artist, whom we get the pleasure of listening to at the end of each unit, is gentle, passionate, expressive and creative.

I have learned an immense amount of knowledge in terms of the history, the barriers/struggles, the resiliance and the culture of First Nations, Inuit and Metis Peoples.  One little suggestion to better the course, is to have a more distinction-based approach and to maybe speak to that more. I felt that having 3 First Nations faciltators throughout this course did not represent the diversity of Indigenous groups in Canada.  Also, when we speak of Inuit or Metis history, stories and culture, it should be done by an Inuk or Metis individual. Their voices should be an equal part to this course, as Inuit and Metis share very different histories, traditional teachings, needs, priorities, etc. than First Nations Peoples.

Some modules could have given more in-depth examples or a critical analysis of certain topics (example, Module 11, Social Media), and many of the figures, artists, movements, etc. presented could have had more representation for greater effect (example, showing the specifc artwork pieces by Odjig, Nicolson, Belcourt, Belmore, etc.).

It certainly provides a foundation for improved understanding of, and empathy for,  the indigenous peoples of Canada and North America. It also provides a perspective that is not always well conveyed by the media with current affairs relating to indigenous peoples.

The delivery of the course is somewhat lacking. More use of multi-media and interactivity in presentation of the information would have made the course far more engaging. The vast majority of the course consists of a presenter reading the content, which is not an effective method of conveying the information in a memorable fashion.

Sorry to hear things really went sour in the 19th century, generational trauma still reverberates, foreign legal and political establishments still seem adverse.However, I am still seeking a way forward. As a second generation immigrant and an empath myself, I have always felt the darkness in Canada and sought to bring light to what really happened here. Sorry is but a word that implies I come from a privileged position immune from the collective, unspoken truth in this country, but the historical reality has brought me down as well. Being an immigrant to Canada still isn't easy, but when newcomers finally raise their noses from the grindstones, how can we (regardless of European, Arabic, East Indian, Asian, or African origins) approach Indigenous persons safely, without triggering anyone's historical pain?I am more interested in training on Indigenous protocol, manners, and modern cultural achievements. As mentioned in the last module of this course, an overview of current literature, art, social media, movies, and perhaps natural medicine to highlight the strengths would be beneficial to everyone. For example, I understand storytelling is important, but do Indigenous cultures prefer the politically correct approach Canada advocates as a way to avoid painful truths and glairing differences between immigrant cultures, or is honesty valued in interpersonal relationships and how should that unfold and enrich an inclusive community?

With this said, I would like to make some suggestions as it relates to the content.  I found some of the terminalogy used in this course to be confusing.  Often I found myself looking up words to determine their meaning.  Including during the quizes.  I noted in some of the forums, others spoke of this as well.  I would suggest reviewing and changing some of this language to use simple terms/language that is easier to understand.  Compicated language causes confusion and stress and is demotivating to students.  It is not necessary in my view.  My moto has always been, ""Let's keep this simple and not compicate things if we can"".  The second concern was when I read pops up that said things like, ""42 percent of people did not pass this quiz on the first attempt, don't get discougaed you can try again"".  I found this disturbing.  If the failure rate is this high, there is a problem with the quiz itself and something needs to change.  This can be demotiviating as well to say the least.  Another pop up was simliar and had a percentage of around 53% .  I just don't recall the exact number but when these percentages are near or over half the entire group in the program that fail a quiz, that's a problem with the quiz/material and not the students abilities.

The information presented in this course resonated on so many levels. It was truly a learning and healing exercise.The course content was deep, concise and presented in a consistent relatable manner. Not having a formal post secondary education I was concerned that the content would be too academic to follow but that was not the case. Some of the material did stray that way but after a couple of reviews it became clear.I appreciated the artistic depictions of the lesson at the end of each module...very, very effective and beautifully done. It was like an instant hit of community coming together to tell the story. I imagine this would be similar to the effect of how ancestral stories were passed on. It felt good to experience that first hand.The Canadian education system would be wise to incorporate this, or portions therein, of this content in existing school programs. Or at the very least inform students of it's existence and let them decide if they want to explore it further.

To ask specifics around - for example - which artist's work was first to be accepted into the Canadian Museum for Human Rights is testing memorization and facts, rather than ""knowledge"".  I have already forgotten the name of that artist, as important has he/she is.

The content is heavy at times, and while I know it can't always be made 'exciting' there are ways to use technology in the service of pedagogy. Some of the visuals were great, and I could see that the designers were really trying, but it could be better. There are some really great examples of engaging educational video content (Youtube: Kurtzgesagt, CrashCourse Series) that course designers can take some inspiration from. I am not saying a direct copy is needed, but there are elements that can easily be replicated to increase the engagement factor. Often times it was just the host speaking, without any visuals / screen text. If creating a learning experience with videos, its important to keep the person visually engaged. Otherwise the learner can just listen, and has no reason to view the videos. I thouroughly enjoyed this course, and it was a good learning experience for me.

As an overview course, it provides good insight into most topics; however, there were several topics that could have used more detail or explanation., e.g., Module 10 mentioned RCAP's Community of Interest as a model, but I was unable to find it within the Report's recommendations on searching. I would have liked a definition of that model rather than a reference.

As as European, French Canadian living in Nelson, BC, and raised in the southern Alberta plains near Medicine Hat, I grew up in a system of racism towards my fellow Aboriginal citizens.  As a young child and teenager, I played sports with my Aboriginal classmates and liked them very much and I was horrified one day in class when our control freak, white principal, strapped an Aboriginal student in our class and I was horrified.  I remember crying all of the way home and knew that what I had witnessed was wrong but none of us had the courage to speak up against it.  That picture of Wendell, who was such a kind and fun person in class has haunted me to this day.  As an interculturalization specialist, I realized a while back that I needed to learn the true histories of our First Nations communities and people and then work to be a supporter and ally.  This course was excellent.  My issue is with the single, archaic assessment strategy as it seems it would have been so much more meaningful to have people write their reactions to situations of abuse and injustice to really internalize how they will accept this no further as white privilege and go beyond a social media post to show support.

Assessments should consist of the main ideas the lecturer is focused on and what they want the students to take away from the lesson; not something that is not significant or barely mentioned.  It was difficult to decide on what notes to take, as the lecturer could have spent a significant time discussing a subtopic and there was nothing on the quiz about that subtopic.  As an educator, I would probably use about 50% of the questions.  Also, there were “glitches” with the technology, as several times the quiz would “freeze” and when I tried to click the screen would eventually work but the click would change an answer (depending on where I had the mouse) or submit it when I was not finished.

4245911~COURSE!~jYd91UquEeWpQA4vMed_oQ,1497899000927,4,0,"When I see indigenous people comment online, they trash-talk both government and first nations community leaders alike.  They distrust both the government who never came through on promises and the leaders who have underfunded their communities for their own enjoyment. I didn't see many solutions suggested or a means to an end to some of these issues in this course so in spite of my new found knowledge it would seem this will remain a vicious circle of poverty, distrust, and fear and this saddens me that that there is still little hope for a resolution. However, this course did bring to light many aspects of my heritage that I was not aware of. My birth father is Métis  however my birth mother is not. I was given up for adoption to a Caucasian family when I was 8 months old, so was unaware of being Métis  for almost all of my life, let alone did I ever feel remotely a part of it once I found out. So this course also suggested that when you are no longer a part of the Indigenous culture and do not look Indigenous in any way, and because you will never experience the hardships or really know anyone who has, you will never be part of that culture. It's like you get to sit in the front row but will never be in the show.The rest of the course was okay, the history I knew, the issues I knew, although the elaboration of them was nice. The introduction of key individuals in forming some semblance of a united indigenous culture were good to know. But this course also reminded me that indigeneity in Canada is also about a fractured and injured culture of people, who are separated by language, distance and who will never have the funding that other communities enjoy, and it will never be a whole. After all had there been more formal territories when NA was colonized, maybe it wouldn't be indigenous Canada, it would be Enoch Territory or Papaschase  Territory or State and many others where Alberta currently sits and it would now be the United Territories of North America, but alas that will never be.

As many people have already mentioned on the discussion forums, some finessing of the quiz questions would help students truly demonstrate their understanding of the material as opposed to only being able to figure out tricks to the quiz. A self-pacing online course is one reason why many people will take this course: that flexibility is great. However, I will say that as the weeks went on (and I was following the 12-week schedule until only the second last week), I found the discussion boards a bit lonely. I would read and sometimes respond to a post, but it had been posted weeks before and that person was likely never going to return to that particular discussion. The TA Sara, though, was awesome had providing helpful and encouraging comments. As someone who has done a lot of work in this topic area already, I was hoping for perhaps an opportunity to write and get direct feedback. I realize that a MOOC isn't really designed for that. But perhaps just as there was a fee for those who wanted to take the quizzes and get credit, perhaps there could be another level for those who want to do assignments and get individual feedback.

I truly enjoyed every module and learned so much about some of the history and various experiences of Indigenous People of Canada.  As a Polish/French Canadian born in Toronto in the late 1960's we truthfully never learned any of this in our history books during my time in grade and/or high school.  During my university days in the late 1980's/90's, I was lucky to have some professors who did introduce me to some books which did help open my eyes to how poorly Indigenous People were treated in Canada.  Having said that though, my knowledge was still pretty limited.  Travelling and living in New Zealand for 10 years from 2006-2015 really opened my eyes to how poorly the Maori were treated in NZ and that is where I started to do more reading on my own to discover the horrible history in my own country of Canada.  Coming back to Canada to work at the City of Edmonton has helped me to continue this journey as the City provided a number of opportunities for me to learn more.  One of those opportunities was this amazing course.  As I mentioned right at the beginning,  I am so happy to have taken this course and I look forward to working with my Indigenous colleagues here at the City to help make Edmonton a more inclusive city for all of its residents; including its Indigenous People.

Truth is necessary, for me, as I have grown up and lived in communities where indigenious people live or have reserves close by. There were times when I would observe the result of years of trauma on a family and I would blame them because what they did was not the same as what I did. This course helped me gain much perspective on why things turned out the way they have.My ignorance is rooted in all the typical misinterpreted beliefs of a privileged white man. My time from now on will be based on the truth in this course so I can reconcile my contribution to this problem. I hope to greet my indigenous ignorance with a new viewpoint to ask questions and listen to the lived experience of my  friends who experienced colonialization with something they might like to share, and for me to learn. In the past, as a result of this course,  the realization  I ignored this information and believed the published media and bad rumors because of my position within society and the mistaken belief we are totally different.Now as my friends are elders and use their traditional name more and more, I can begin to listen to their true answers.One last thing. The treatment of all females, in our society, and particularly women of indigenous heritage, is something that has to change.  As a white male I no longer put up with the toxic attitude toward women in general I used to just ignore when I was in the working world. The current highly misogynistic culture, in my opinion, being mostly a minority, but vocally and physically extreme people in our society need to be shown this society will not put up with any form of coercion, manipulation or abuse. Our legal system has to give  females more credibility and tools to expose this kind of behaviour and to stop it. All of society has to help with this problem. I feel it is also up to me to speak up when necessary.We are so much the same and should honor that truth.I grew up on the land with the people who know it.

100183815~COURSE!~jYd91UquEeWpQA4vMed_oQ,1647814175381,5,0,"

I want to start off my review by saying how incredibly disgusted I am knowing how the Canadian Government has treated Indigenous peoples both passed and present.  Being educated in Ontario Catholic school system during the 70’s, I don’t recall being taught about Indigenous life, there may have been some historical teachings about the Fur Trade, I do recall watching short films about Inuit life particularly, but nothing like what I have learned taking this course.  
 I strongly believe that if the Canadian Government  and the Catholic Faith & all organized religions that were involved in the residential school’s,  really want to make amends, and for healing to happen, there needs to be omission and hard honest truths spoken to all Canada people about the transgressions that have happened and to  call it what it was A GENOCIDE.    As a Canadian, I am embarrassed to admit that I had very little understanding about Indigenous Culture, not having an understanding of treaties and the importance of them and really only learned about the Residential Schools when I was in my 20.  Even then,   I still did not have the complete picture.  Over the years I have come to know that there was much abuse that happened and could not understand how this was allowed to continue for so long.  Like every one else in the last couple of years hearing about the RS, but unfortunately not socked by the horrible and unspeakable acts of indecency that have happened makes  me feel so angry and disgusted.  As did all the reports that started coming out about the sexual abuse casses of alter boys throught out North America.  It was then that I stopd practising my faith. On a more personal note, I am a survivor of childhood abuse & trauma, and know all too well the  lasting effects it has on ones life. It is something I live with everyday.   I have great empathy for those Indigenous lives in the past and present that are dealing with mental health & addiction issues because of there experiences.     I have been very fortunate in my life, I’ve been married for over 33 years to one of the most loving and supportive husbands a wife could every ask for.  I first met my husband when I was 16, and I’m 56 years old now.   I have been privilage more then most over my adult life in getting psychological thearpy.   Even with the help I have gotten and all the hard work of self reflecting and personal growth, I still have and most likely will always have issues to deal with.  So for someone of Indigenous culture not having the same resources for help, is devastating because until one has recognition and closure, only then can healing begin.   Unless I’m miss understanding this, CG should be providing quality counselling for Indigenous families in crisis.  AND NOT WITH CATHOLIC FAMILY SERVICES. If it still exists. Thats a joke in and onto it self. Because of my childhood experiences, I have always struggled to believe in God, and even though I  practised my RC faith as a young person into adulthood.  I was always seeking answers to the million questions I had, and still  felt unfulfilled.  I do believe in a God that is not of man made rule along with the Indigenous spiritual belief systems, as they truly resonate with me. Please I mean NO disrespect by stating this.  As well as along side  a little buddha teachings, as this is what brings peace to my heart and soul.   In conclusion, now that I have a better understanding of Indigenous  worldview and beliefs’ I will do my part to the best of my ability to give back to Indigenous people and communities the best way I can.  I can not change the past, but I can contribute to making the life of Indigenous people better.   My next goal is to seek out businesses and artist  of Indigenous people  as my first attempt to giving back. Starting with reading THE COLONIAL PROBLEM, as an extension and complementary addition in gaining more knowledge of Indigenous life.    I will also share with my friends & family  what I have learned and will encourage them to do this course.
Lastly I can not thank you enough for this course.   May the further for all Indigenous lives be more conclusive and respected everywhere.Your friend Teresa.

Concepts of world views and ways of knowing were new to me, and learning about the different views between Indigenous and European peoples early in the course gave context for the issues that inevitably arose in our mutual history.  The progression from pre-contact, through the fur trade, treaty-making and government assimilation policy gave me an understanding of events in modern times - resistance, land claims, contesting & winning changes to questionable, often inhumane policy - holding the Canadian government accountable.  We are now living a new phase of Indigenous-Settler relationship: mass awareness of the Truth, and reconciling; advocating for & implementing Indigenous self-government, ways of education, art, healing, technology and addressing climate change.The course is well structured over 12 weeks to make the complex material accessible & manageable.  The videos are a good length - bite-size yet substantial - and the added interviews give voice & perspective to the content.  In particular, Kim Tallbear's commentary on feminist democratic science was stunningly eye-opening for me. It is enlightenment to realize that science as we know it could have the built-in bias of white western men.  Leah Dorion's special art project is a moving addition, giving a creative mode of learning through symbolic imagery & story to the weekly lessons.

I met the walkers for the 215+ I wanna come home group who were walking from Winnipeg to Kamloops carrying tiny moccasins. I met them on our nations first TRC day, Sept 30, 2021 in Moose Jaw. A friend posted a link to this course a few days later in Facebook, and inspired by the 215+ walkers, decided to match their journey by doing this course. I thought it would be easy.I did not find this course to be “easy” .I was dealing with an old mind that had not studied in over 40 years. I was pushing through old ideas and beliefs, challenging them at every step. A module that was advertised to take 2 hours of study often took me four times that long. It took multiple tabs on Chrome, a history of Canada in an excel spreadsheet and pages of notes for me to plow through all this material. The language was tough for me, as my white ears struggled to spell and pronounce the indigenous names. All I can say is that it was worth it, and it comes easier to me now.I cried through some of these modules. I realized how close I had been to so many important issues and things, but didn’t see them for what they were at the time. I have travelled extensively throughout this nation as a former military member. I need to make trips all over again to see what I missed the first time. I was posted in Cold Lake. How I wish I could have met Alex Janvier in the early 80’s when I was there, to see his art .I saw Trace at the Museum of Human Rights, but didn’t know the full story. I brought my grandsons to the Forks to see the rivers and to find Louis Riel’s grave, but was unable to tell them all the history that happened on those shores. I am much better equipped to do that now, thanks to this course.This course could not have been easy to put together, and it is not lost on me that it needed to be severely edited to stay on track. As fast as I learned material, I wound up with more questions. I am very grateful to the teachers and presenters who brought this material my way.

I wish that Western society would wake up and understand that if we changed our philosophy of life to be more in tune with yours, a lot of our problems would disappear, and Mother Earth and all her inhabitants would be much better off.I did know about the residential schools and their impacts quite a long time ago, ironically through a TV show on CBC called North of 60 which came out about 1990. It had a lot of amazing indigenous actors, and many of the characters had been to residential school and of course were still suffering from its impacts, and those of the Indian Act. I took a course in Indigenous Studies at university in the late 1970's. I remember learning about the White Paper, and for some reason thought it was a good thing. It was enlightening to see it through Indigenous eyes.I am so glad that I took this course. It was recommended on CBC radio, and apparently also by Daniel Levy! My next goal in my learning is to read the Calls to Action from the TRC and to listen again  to Roseanna Dearchild's interview of Murray Sinclair  on CBC radio where he gives a great summary of what we can do to help make reconciliation happen.

ideology – understanding the only way to break the cycle is to recognize things
need to change.  Acknowledging both sides

Completing the course has given me a profound sense of all I didn't know about my own country's history but I committed to taking this course to start to rectify my own lack of knowledge. I guess I also took up the call to begin my own journey to truth and reconciliation and acknowledge my settler identity. I learned a great deal, too much to relate here. But, the instructors did a fantastic job of helping me 'relearn' and 'unlearn' much of what I remember from school history classes (and other post secondary classes).  Those classes glossed over or didn't even mention Indigenous Peoples in Canada!  I am ashamed I didn't know a lot about these First Peoples in Canada.  As the instructors indicated, this is a primer course that could not cover everything, but contained so much valuable and rich information that will now motivate me to continue learning about the founding peoples of this land.  I think one overarching message that will remain is the profound connection Indigenous Peoples have with the land, water and air, something we settlers just can't fully appreciate. Also, the connection with family and the importance of the wisdom of elders in passing down essential stories to younger generations.  The respect for elders is again, something that is not universal in our settler, western society.  Modules were really well organized and covered so many relevant topics and issues.  Also, a big shout out to Leah Dorion whose vivid, colourful, impactful, provocative, humorous, thought-provoking and relatable artwork contributed so much to me to help me learn more during each of the modules.   It was a pleasure to watch the final video on course art that really brought  together her vision and thought processes for each piece.  Kudos to the faculty for choosing to collaborate with her!  I cannot say enough about the impact this course has had on me personally and I thank everyone involved at the university for putting this course together.

It provided me with an expanded perspective and a new lens for which me to look through at indigenous communities of Canada. This course has provide me with a base knowledge and insight into indigenous ways and laid the foundation for building blocks on an ever icreasing journey of knowledge about indigenous culture, history, art, believes, governence, gender and more. I learned things i didn't know, or where not taught, about the ways indegenous communities where treated because of colonialsm, by both church and state, and the resilancy of indegenous communties through unimaginable atrocities. It challenged my whiteness, my prespective and my own colonialist education. Changing the way I view, what I believe and how i see the impacts of what white settler colonialism has had and is still having on indigenous communities across Canada. How the indigenous communities of Canada have struggled, are struggling and continue to struggle against white settler colonialism and its systemic damaging effects to women, youth and the purposeful distruction of cultural identity in trying to ""remove the indian"" from indegenous communities via residential schools,  the Indian Act and ""lawful"" means.
Thank you as well to all the facilitator, educators, story tellers and anybody who contributed to this immensely rich educational program.

I would like to comment on some of the other, less positive reviews, so that potential students are not put off from completing the course.1. ""The information was too one-sided."" All the eurocentric history I have studied previously, was also one-sided. It is good to learn from different viewpoints, so as to gain a broader understanding.2. ""There were not enough examples of...(art, different nations, etc.) In a 12 week course, it is impossible to provide every bit of information each student wants. However, it is a great, brief introduction, enabling learners to search out further resources, if desired.3. ""The lectures were boring as the presenters were..(stiff, reading from a teleprompter.)"" As I was told when I was enrolled in another indigenous studies course, we need to accept various ways of teaching. Indigenous peoples had to, and if you are really committed to learning an indigenous-based program, you have to adapt to different teaching styles. It is not easy, and I felt the same way as some of the commenters, at times, but I kept reminding myself of what my former teacher told me.4. ""There were too many teaching modalities, or the modalities were not used to their full capacity."" Several different methods, such as lectures, interviews, videos of dancing, art, etc, are helpful for students with different learning styles. As for using the modalities to their full capacity, I feel that in such a short course, there would not be enough time to do so.I sincerely hope that anyone who begins with an interest in this course does attempt it. I have a few positive points to add. 1. FREE! The fact that this course is provided free of charge, is a wonderful opportunity for anyone who wants to get a very brief synopsis of indigenous Canada. 2. SIMPLE & FUN: The lectures were simple to follow and the interviews and art added a fun component. I believe these attributes make this course accessible to many, including those who have never completed post-secondary coursework prior. 3. CONTRIBUTORS: The creation of this course must have been a monumental task and that fact alone makes one appreciate all contributors for their roles in creating the course. 4. SHORT & MANAGEABLE: The course was short and broken into manageable components. I completed it during breaks at work, in a month. 5. NO PRESSURE FOR GRADES: Unlike grade school, you can redo the quizzes until you pass, or get a higher mark. Personally, I redid the quizzes until I was sure I understood all the information reviewed.Thank you",0,3,Mary Lynch,87541014

Their views are an imperative part of gaining a factual comprehension of our World, not only for the understanding of current Canadian matters, but also for gaining a true insight into the impacts of Colonialism & why it is so despised by almost ALL of the peoples it works against, globally. The course clearly highlights the tactics used by a small group of Europeans with very fixed & particular views dominated by the craving for short term profit, inappropriate control & the systematic decimation of anything and anyone they see as an obstacle to their goal of acquisition of material goods on both individual and mass scales. I regard this as essential learning for both the descendants of Colonials and other Indigenous Peoples who have suffered similar experiences of such management systems.

It certainly does give a different perspective from the one that we were taught
growing up (I'm a young 73) or the one portrayed in the 20th century media. It
is amazing to learn about Indigenous resilience and determination - which
should never have been necessary if they had been treated properly. After all,
we took their land and treated them as our inferiors. It is sad that Indigenous have had to fight so hard for
something that was theirs and their ancestors in the first place. They were
here long before we were and they were doing a much better job of living on the
land (rather than off of it).  If we could go back and live as they did,
there could be peace but that is not possible.  But, we can learn from
them.  They worried then and still do about leaving something for future
generations!This course also makes one want to delve further into the
subject and find a way to stop and reverse what is happening.  Indigenous
peoples are entitled to their land claims and more!  How do we ever
compensate them for the loss of their children and the damage done by
residential schools?  It was Genocide and we as Canadians (although we
were for the most part ignorant of what was happening) are responsible.  Ignorance is not an excuse!  My ancestors (I’m of Irish decent) came here for a better life BUT we
took THEIR LAND and tried to ASSIMILATE them.  God forgive us! I, for one, will be doing more research and hopefully will find
some small way to add my voice with theirs for the justice they deserve. 
I don’t think the Truth & Reconciliation Commission did much to rectify the
situation – especially in regards to dead and missing women and two spirit
people - I think it is just a band-aid.  More needs to be done and

There has been too much talk and not enough action and it's time for the government to articulate a clear and decisive change of heart and to put serious effort into settling claims, doing away with the Indian Act and rectifying the harm we caused with the Residential schools. The fact that First Nations, Inuit and Metis people are still able to produce beautiful art, reclaim their language and nurture their culture, in spite of all the pain we have caused, speaks to their resiliency and I personally wish there was more I could do to contribute to their struggle.",0,1,Nelson Quiroga,78388351

79999102~COURSE!~jYd91UquEeWpQA4vMed_oQ,1612903028737,5,0,"  It is inspiring to take the colonial teaching we learned in school and flip it to get the other side of the equation.  To open a window to the culture of a nation that respects and lives with the land in harmony.

It also exposes the disrespectful nature of a government imposing unnatural expectations on indigenous people and pushing an agenda that completely disregards the culture and needs of the people.  

I think it is important to seek understanding of the indigenous plight and have empathy to their culture and the road of reconciliation.  Where prejudices and racial discrimination are eliminated and replaced with kindness, knowledge, and understanding.  It isn't just their struggle.  For me, it hits close to home. 

I grew up in an environment where connection to the land and nature was a way of life.  My father (settler in the late 40's) taught me to respect the land and live with it in harmony.  As I watch the current changing times where the freedoms I had as a child are being compromised; freedom to have family in our homes, to travel, to own firearms, and to live without fear.... I reflect on the perils of the indigenous people stripped of their freedom and way of life.  It's everyone's struggle.  ",0,1,Ursula Wittner,79999102

The course will help you to view the history of Canada from an important perspective, one that has often been ignored.While I've never been to Canada; through reading the course I have noticed many similarities over here in Australia, and the treatment of Indigenous Australians, and I'm hoping one day there will be similar courses here exploring those cultural perspectives that have also often been ignored.It was also great to have some perspectives of what Canada was like before European colonization, because often that's the part where most history books begin, and there's a great deal of history that goes unheard as a result of that, it's unfortunately rare to have those insights into the history, lifestyle, expression, education, law and culture of indigenous canadians before European historical perspectives surfaced, so another reason why I liked this course was the knowledge of what pre-colonial canada was like, the social systems and community  structure of indigenous cultures in particular and how they differed from the ones introduced by western culture.

Well designed, excellent curriculum, especially considering the enormity of materials to cover.  It was easy to navigate, easily understood and help was always available if needed.  LOVED the paintings by Leah Dorion; such an important aspect of our learning.  Her paintings really highlighted what we were learning and reinforced the importance of story telling through the generations.  For me, It was an introduction to another Indigenous artist I had not yet discovered. (Maxine Noel and Alex Janvier are my favourites)The forums were helpful to connect to other learners.  I especially appreciate that we could download and print materials to refer back to and to share with others.  As an ally, my desire is to share what I have learned with those who may be ignorant of the issues, history and genocide of inhabitants of Turtle Island.  Education really is the new Buffalo!  Now if we can just get more settlers watching APTN, they may start to understand the harm of colonialism too!This curriculum was obviously a labour of love and I am so thankful that we have been given access to this resource of information and understanding.

Specific examples from specific nations, court cases, artists, etc. were very helpful.The only weak point, for me, was the quiz questions - too many were over-simplified, repetitious, or focused on relatively minor points while omitting key priority concepts and events in each unit.

Every Canadian should know these facts. Pre-Colonial Aboriginals were HIGHLY ENLIGHTENED. ✨🌞✨No wonder colonialists did everything they could to suppress this information and their people. Never would have suited their agenda - seeing as how their agenda was never the betterment of humanity as a whole. In Pre colonial times the women were exalted and revered hunters, caregivers, gatherers etc, often even responsible for choosing their chiefs. In Pre colonial times 'Two- Spirit' was a name termed for those under the bi-sexual umbrella. Or those with a feminine and masculine spirit. Before colonist patriarchal ways took over.  Twisting their minds to believe women were inferior and christianity promoting homosexual/lesbian relations as evils. How progressive to not need to change and dominate everything.  Accepting nature as is. Everything is interconnected, the land is sacred and we are not the most important in this world. So many new things I've learned from this course. My two favourite are the Mohawk story of creation (Sky Woman) & the Nehiyawa (Cree) people considered the word 'Daytime' to be almost vulgar as this was seen as a spiritual 'EVENT' that the great spirit gave us eyes to witness.The horrors are many - the amount of residential school children in Canada not returning to their families was 42%.

For me, I find it easier to learn from reading than from listening, so I would read through the transcripts first, take notes, and then watch the video for any graphs or context I may have missed. Made for some hilarious misunderstandings until I got to the point in the video where the mistake was, and then all was cleared. No harm though, the teachings still came across! :)Might I suggest having someone go over the transcript and the video to fix those little mistakes?But other than that, thank you UofA for the incredible work you've put into this course!",0,1,Juliana de Medeiros,69192036

I was fortunate to have grown up under the tutelage of very inclusive parents.  My mother was the owner of the Handloom store in Victoria.  As such she became a major outlet for many of the artists of the west coast including the argillite carvers of Haida Gwaii with visits to their homes and families.  I have long been a student of world history and have read a few of the stories of first nations.  Two of the more influential were Hanta Yo (twice) and Song of the Meadowlark (thrice).  Indian Horse, Sweetgrass and Motorcycles and currently God is Red.  I am greatly interested in the evolution of First Nations power noting how it has been greatly facilitated by both the English language and modern invention.  The course employed the classic technique of comparing ""our best with their worst"" (Ken Wilbur A Brief History of Everything) but I recognized that as a lead-in to invite all to rise to a better standard.I have also long been a critic of ""western civilization"" in spite of the fact that I'm intensely grateful that I'm not a slave, wet, cold or hungry.  I believe that the final result of the rise of  Red Power will be a new, more integrated, respectful, sustainable way of being.  The challenge being that it will have to be so powerful as to make current forms of resource use and money power obsolete.There is much to be learned from"" your best"".I say ""your best"" because my own ancestry is 100% European",0,1,Robert Higgin,66397742

I rarely learned Indigenous histories, knowledges, and contemporary influences in any classes in school and if I did, it was usually from a racist perspective. I always should have done more to learn and I know my awareness and understanding is still a work-in-progress. I am so thankful for this course and I am going to continue my learning journey. As a white settler, I am remaining aware and alert of the ways I benefit from racism and the privilege I have. This means I have a responsibility to learn about the land I'm on and this history connected with it. I have a responsibility to contribute to decolonizing. This course did more than teach history from an Indigenous perspective; it communicated the underlying theme that we all have a responsibility to the land and to others. We should have reciprocity and so far, the government and White people have had a primarily take (and not give) relationship with Indigenous peoples. This course motivated me to do more to learn and contribute to the ongoing struggle for Indigenous rights and recognition. I would love to see an update on some of the course content. For instance, in the video about conceptions of gender and sex, sex is referred to as biological (by social scientists) and gender is cultural. However, that is becoming an outdated conception and I believe many social sciences now are considering that both sex and gender are very much products of the society. Also, Neechi Commons as shut down which is so sad and I hope they're able to re-open. Thank you to the instructors and anyone else involved in making this course!!

I really liked this course, loved the beautiful fusain (?) portraits (the eyes only are so telling...), getting to know the history of Turtle Island before the creation of Canada was very precious, especially around understanding the Treaties (I would believe most Canadians settlers do not know what is it about and even less Canadian settlers immigrants like myself), and the Fur Trade (I probably learned the most Modules 1-4). I did my master's research paper on Indigenous Women’s Resilience, Resistance and Cultural Resurgence through Activism and Art (Turtle Island), I had loved Christi Belcourt's Walking With Our Sisters' initiative, they are with us and we are with them. This helps me understand what I couldn't two years ago, and I hope that in two years my comprehension will grow twofold or more. I did find that some of the modules at the end (e.g. Indigenous women and even how certain policies still affect them disproportionately) could have been more through, but considering the course is free and that you are sharing on Indegeneity, the content is amazing! I do want to follow a course on Indigenous art, there is so much so much! From signing, spoken poetry, beading, painting, rap, sculpture, weaving, media such a films, documentaries, etc. and all the things I am forgetting about. Do I recommend this course to any fellow settler Canadian out there? Yes I do. These things should be mandatory anyway, but can you force people to learn, I don't know.

Most were excellent people, One became a prominent lawyer in the Maritimes. The very few that were ""problems"" where problems because of their personalities and actions, not their indigeneity.

When I've heard about the various protests over the years I will admit that I didn't really understand the essence of what was being protested.  When I was a small child I had a goal to meet someone from every country in the world.  While I haven't achieved that goal I have met people from many countries, including my own.  I've always found that people are people and while the colour of our skin might be different, in essence, we are all the same.  It makes me very sad that many people continue to treat one another with disrespect.  That disrespect often begins in our family of origin and then ripples outward from there.

There is so much learning packaged so efficiently, and I learned so much. I wish I had something like this to take when I first arrived in Canada as a modern settler. This course should be mandatory for everyone living Canada and for all the new settlers, but especially for politicians, anyone working for government, public institutions and in private sector companies that have anything to do with Indigenous peoples, the land, the environment and so much more.Of course, I'm basing that on the assumption that the more one learns about one's impact on people and the world the less inclined we would be to do harm. That probably sounds naive. But more learning would be a good place to start - for us all!   This course is a good way to learn, among other things, how modern settlers are co-opted into and benefit from the structure of lies, betrayal, violence and theft that is the ongoing colonization project. It was inspiring and deeply moving to learn about the many ways in which Indigenous peoples have been resisting colonization and remained strong and grounded.

As a white settler, you only really hear about some of these issues in passing and I'm really disapointed in our school system that still hasn't been changed to teach EVERYONE about our terrible history. This course really helped open my eyes to the issues I only ever hear in passing. It was nice to have some more context for things, and although I understand that this is an introductory course I found some of the information given too shallow, vague, or simplified. I would really love even more information, examples, and history to be given in each lesson. I would also love more information to be provided on reconciliation and how white settlers can help achieve this. A main sentiment that comes up in conversation is that we would like to do our part to be allies and to help right wrongs and move towards reconciliation, but how to do that is always vague. Questions about whether or not it's proper for us to continue doing something are never answered, and I understand we need to consult elders to gain their insight and perspectives on how to do that, but most of us have no clue how to reach out to elders to begin that process or in some cases, even us reaching out and asking those questions is not wanted. Overall I enjoyed the course, it was a great starting point to begin delving further into this topic. Thank you very much. ",0,1,Rachel Touchie,8856644
