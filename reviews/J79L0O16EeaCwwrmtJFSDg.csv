74031510~COURSE!~J79L0O16EeaCwwrmtJFSDg,1677160099600,1,0,"The courses before the capstone were excellent. The capstone itself is riddled with flaws. It seems the capstone course has been tended to in years. Some of the courses listed were not included in the lead up to the capstone. The reface material for the capstone has dead links and some require the learner to subscribe to the website for a fee - which makes it feel spammy. The layout of the quizzes is broken, which is sure to be a problem for screen readers and possibly problematic for international students. And the peer grading for the written assignment is littered with plagiarism and frustrated and unethical peers looking for payback. Major disappointment after completing the other courses. Can't understand why Coursera would allow this to go unattended considering that many learners have voiced similar concerns.",0,0,Michael P. Iannece,74031510
42101415~COURSE!~J79L0O16EeaCwwrmtJFSDg,1640515531943,1,0,"I’ve done most of the iMBA from the University of Illinois and this is by far the worse course I’ve done so far.

It seems to be out of sync with the previous courses in the specialization by referring to courses with different titles and concepts that were not covered. 

There is not enough information available publicly to properly do all of the assignments. 

Even the formatting of quizzes is completely broken. ",0,1,Piotr Jagielski,42101415
23438227~COURSE!~J79L0O16EeaCwwrmtJFSDg,1567539354781,1,0,"The capstone course did not bring me any value add at all. Reason why:The tests and the assignments were too superficial or focused on unnecessary detailsThe target company (Local Motors) was not really suited for the assignments. Clear example: how can one to assess a PRIVATE company from the perspective of a venture capital fund, without having access to any numbers and to the company's strategy. Next time, please pick a listed company.Some resources (articles) about the target company were outdated.There was no new insight, no real guidance what so ever,  just a set of dull quizzes and assignments (each assignment was the same as the other - 2 strengths / 2 weaknesses, but with other content).In a word, a total waste of time.",0,5,Alexandru Atanasoaei,23438227
15175722~COURSE!~J79L0O16EeaCwwrmtJFSDg,1564528363664,1,0,"I have done dozens of courses on Coursera and this might be my least favorite. It is a disgrace to the rest of the specialization because the ""innovation/creativity/entrepreneurship principles"" are not actually related to the materials taught in previous courses. You are given formulaic assignments to evaluate strength and weaknesses of a chosen company (which is frankly troubled and potentially a fraud) according to these principles. You are given some case materials which may or may not touch on any of these principles.  There are not enough guidelines for these assignments (i.e. word counts) and people's submissions are vastly different.  Yet you have to finish it as part of a specialization.  I hated it!",0,6,Jingting Lu,15175722

The assignments point to some principles that aren't directly mentioned in the earlier courses. Although you can get by but it feels a bit weird doing them.",0,1,Roger Wang,88738786
