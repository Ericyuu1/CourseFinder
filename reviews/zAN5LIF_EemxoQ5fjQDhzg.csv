Most of the simulations in the last 2 weeks didn't make any sounds when loaded. Also, the last week simulations didn't load what-so-ever.",0,0,Bob Bird,74608501

For those interested in other aspects of sound design (like myself), this course still offers some insight into the principles of good sound and user interpretation.",0,0,Brendan Waters,91417770
