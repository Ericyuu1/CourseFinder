The comparison of traditional  methods of management against new methods was especially useful, breaking down management styles into specific actions and choices.However, there were some aspects that made the course a bit frustrating:1) The course videos were belabored, for example taking a long time to define basic concepts.2) The lectures focused significantly on terminology, rather than the concepts. This was reflected in the quizzes and final assessment, which seemed more concerned with whether a particular word was used rather than if we could successfully reason about management.3) Management by nature poses open-ended questions and gray areas, but this course took a very black-and-white view towards some concepts (e.g. whether linear alignment is better or worse, etc) that don't necessary reflect the dynamic nature of reality.All this being said, I enjoyed learning many of the concepts in this course.

I have tried to make a complaint but there is no contact or anywhere to do so. The online chat guy was of no help and kept telling me can't change my mark. My point wasn't about my mark but that I have been deliberately marked down to fail me and provided screen shot where most questions I got a mark of 3 each and the last one which is for the overall course mark gave me a 1. Mathematically it doesn't add up. Nothing I could do about than resubmit the assignment, however if the University embarks on such method to allow peers to grade then they are ultimately responsible and are required to ensure students are not targeted and maliciously marked down. other than that I have thoroughly enjoyed the course.

Our annual budget meets are now highlighted by project teams that focus around areas such as:effective brandingcost rationalizing (not cutting)product development, etc.Annual meets, that were enveloped by each branch’s numbers and performance indicators of target achievement, etc. are now fun.
