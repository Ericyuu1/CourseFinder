By the fourth week, I started just skipping to the quiz and finding other resources to teach me how to solve the problems.  Then, I decided to just give up entirely.

This expectation is unacceptable.  Secondly, no mention in the course information, videos, etc. was there any indication that there was coding.  These coding assignments are delivered with no hint given as to what we would need to do, how, and why, which is entirely unacceptable.  Lastly, the course creators are available nowhere.

In the assignment, students are being asked to find the roots of a quadratic equation.5.) Some questions and even their answers too technical to be understood by many students.

9781766~COURSE!~ARf5_jvZEeeYEBLbuVGJ2g,1552680790961,2,0,"Disclaimer: If you are familiar with Linear Algebra, you may love this course. This review is not for those people. This review is for the people who went to the course details, saw that the recommended audience was 'Beginner' level, and decided to give it a try, thinking it involved a low barrier of entry. You'd be thinking incorrectly. Here is why.  Let me start off by stating two things. First: I am terrible at all things mathematics, and wanted to improve my capabilities in this area. Second: This is by far the worst Coursera course that I've taken to date. I put all my effort into not only completing the course, but doing so on time, so that I don't dump more money into a course than completely necessary. With this course, I found myself loathing the prospect of torturing myself with the material, that I kept putting it off. I eventually had to come to terms that I hated this whole experience, and canceled my subscription prior to completing even the first course!1.) The videos are absolutely useless - Up-to-date on all the latest and great math jargon? Well, you'd better be, or else you'll find yourself Googling terms like a madman and re-watching the videos over and over, just to get a grasp on what is going on. All this is topped off with the instructor talking a mile a minute (does he even breathe?) and making numerous mistakes throughout the videos. This will then prompt you to pause the video you were watching to go search the forums in order to see if the way you were taught to do something in a previous video was incorrect all along, just to find a post that confirms that the video did in fact have an error. Do yourself a favor and skip directly to the practice quizzes. You'll be equally clueless as to what is going on, but you won't have wasted time by watching pointless videos.2.) I'm assuming the assignments and practices quizzes are in some way correlated to the subject matter depicted in said useless videos in point 1. If there is, then the questions therein are massively beefed up version of the subject. Nothing made me feel quite as stupid as practice quiz 1 of week 4 (this is where I finally gave up and called it quits). The only redeeming factor is that I'm not the only doofus in the room. The student forums are full of equally clueless people.3.) For the price of $50 a month, I expected this course to house all I would need to ease me into the topic of Linear Algebra. Instead, it feels like I've been thrown into the ocean with cinder blocks strapped to my feet without knowing how to swim. Logically, I started grasping for the life boats that are Khan Academy and YouTube. I shouldn't have to go to external resources if I'm paying money to be taught something, but I did. Even though these external resources helped me better understand the concepts, the quiz material still looked like absolutely gibberish to me. That's when I knew this was no ""Beginner"" course.All said, just buy a Linear Algebra text book off of Amazon if you want to learn this topic. It's cheaper in the long run, and coupled with Khan Academy, it'll get you farther. The only reason it isn't a single star for me is the fact that maybe it is beneficial for people who actually like math.",0,86,Andrew T Medhurst,9781766

It would also help if you have some rudimentary knowledge of programming i.e. know basic syntax, what a for loop or a while loop is and other basics.  I know a bit of programming and i'm pretty ok at math so the course was manageable for me. Especially good was showing how all of the concepts learnt can be applied to understanding the Google Page Rank algorithm.The best part of this course is the conceptual overview it gives and the instructors constantly reiterate how this type of understanding is more important than just being able to chug through a whole lot of algebra.  Computational skills aren't really that important because apart from very basic examples, a computer is pretty much necessary to do the calculations anyway and as we all know, just because you know how to plug stuff into a formula doesn't mean you have the faintest idea what you are actually doing!I think a very bright person could probably fully understand this course coming at it from scratch but I know that I would have struggled if i'd never glanced at the math or done some basic programming before.",0,0,John Farley,39531482

Look, two recommendations about this course: this is a tough course! Especially if you've never seen Linear Algebra. Don't let this course be your first contact with Linear Algebra. If you do, at least take a famous reference book like Strang and follow the course with the book. Also, do not expect to watch the videos and understand the content magically. The course is full of assignments and challenging exercises, which are fundamental to having fun with the MOOC.

T​his course helped me to review knowledge and, more than that, to develop new intuition about some topics in Linear Algebra. The instructors are great! The video production is really good!

I like it because it encourages self-learning than being spoon-fed by the lectures.

Not going to lie, this was the most challenging coursera course I have taken so far but that means I actually spent hours studying!

My tips would be to watch the Youtube videos they recommend early in the course and attempt all the ungraded exercises. Utilize the discussion forum if you are stuck. I find the discussion forum and Youtube playlist really helped me grasp the concept. If you can get the textbooks, it's not necessary but they are also great study supplements

Teaching material is very clear and nicely structured - I've shared the first video about Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues with many people: it's illuminating -; also, quizzes and programming assignments really helped in understanding some of the main concepts. Actually, the nice balance among theory, hand-made calculations, geometrical examples and programming assignments provides a valuable way to learn from multiple perspectives.Apart from this. I realize that I still have to completely ""digest"" some of the concepts that have been introduced here. In other words, I've learned to use them decently but for sure I need to reharse some of them in order to fully understand their meaning. But, by the way, this is fair enough: linear algebra is a complex and deep subject and five weeks are probably not enough to fully understand its main principles.   ",0,0,Stefano Casali,3282066

The videos are very well produced, animations look great and explanations are crystal clear. The instructors present the topics in a friendly way and always keep the focus on the concepts rather than on manual calculations (of which you won't be doing much in ML...).  The only downside is that watching videos more slowly (0.75x) is not fluent. I don't know if the issue is on my end or if the videos don't have enough frames per second.

63200668~COURSE!~ARf5_jvZEeeYEBLbuVGJ2g,1601900349589,5,0,"First of all, the instructor clearly loves the subject he is teaching. You can tell immediately by the voice and the gestures.Second,
 the fact that he is not a pure mathematician means he is constantly 
looking for the link between what he is teaching and practical examples.
 That's a must when you are teaching math to students intending to use 
it in real life (Machine Learning).Third, there is a good structure to the material being taught, always building on what has previously been taught.Fourth,
 is the amount of quizzes and exercises. Math can only be learned 
effectively if you keep challenging yourself in quantity and quality. 
Everyone remembers the quality bit, but some miss the quantity. Not this
 instructor I have to say. Congrats for that.Fifth, intuition 
is being built from day one. Big applause for that as Linear Algebra 
lives and dies by the amount of intuition that's being put into its 
practice.Sixth, my hat's off for the esthetic quality of the figures and exercises, and for their clarity.Seventh,
 even for an engineer like me (graduated over 20 years ago I have to 
say) who's been best friends with Linear Algebra and Calculus for the 6 
years I was in university (10 semesters + a final Master's thesis), this
 course wasn't trivial, and kept me making an effort at every bend, at 
every corner. This is something I am grateful for, as while I was 
refreshing concepts that I hadn't touched for 20 years now, I did have 
real fun.Eighth, the coding examples are a magnificent tool 
that greatly helped strengthening some concepts (like Gram-Schmidth, 
etc.). Amazing job there.Ninth, you can see how towards the end of the course, gears are shifted, pushing the student to get mental agility, and conveying the student the importance of intuition building (+ some algebraic symbolic manipulation) as opposite of focusing mainly on the symbolic manipulation. A good approach nowadays that computers do the computation for us, as opposite to what it used to be some decades ago. I really liked the fact that the instructors (Dr. Dye and Dr. Cooper) tried, both, to covey this very practical philosophical paradigm from day one.My most sincere ""cum laude"" score for this course.Nabil Chouaib.

Particularly the questions about finding the effect of using a particular Link matrix on the eigenvectors. These questions were not easy to answer as intuitively speaking I did not learn how to interpret the meaning of different values in the eigenvectors matrix to answer those questions forex. it makes the eigenvalues small or It makes the eigenvalues we are looking for larger.Overall - it is a really useful and much-required course to fill in the gap between the mathematical fundamentals and the practice of machine learning.

The eigenvector materials are conceptually slippery.  Maybe one more example to work through, with clumsier numbers?

It is not an in-depth formal introduction to the mathematics of linear algebra. For those who are looking for that, the course simply does not deliver. Secondly, while it is technically possible to complete this course without any beforehand knowledge of the topic, I think this would be incredibly challenging to do. Indeed, the course is not intended to be a first primer in linear algebra. The ease with which the instructors just juggle the cosine rule, or calculate the inverse of a 2 by 2 matrix indicates that they do assume you know such things. So also absolute beginners will be disappointed with this course. However, if you have had linear algebra in your past, and you are using this course to refresh your mind, it is absolutely brilliant.
