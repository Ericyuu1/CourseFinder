6929141~COURSE!~JVw44kxSEeiKBBJnjV2o_g,1612301213474,1,0,"Not a beginner-level course - or at least not for someone who has no previous knowledge of using GIS. There is no attempt made to define key terms or ideas, and the first assignment has very few directions for someone who has never used a GIS system. Definitely no step-by-step and I am having to rely on Google to figure out what the instructions mean, rather than being taught by the course itself.",0,2,Sarah Westerman,6929141

106409770~COURSE!~JVw44kxSEeiKBBJnjV2o_g,1652234225715,2,0,"I​ like the struture of the course and the fact that the course uses an open-source software: QGIS. Unfortunately, the English translation is not particularly good, which impedes understanding. The worst aspect is that the course uses an older version of the software than the current version.  Differences between the older and current version mean that the prompts provided by the course exercises do not seem to be appropriate for the current QGIS version. As I could not get the exercise to work, I wrote on the course discussion forum to get some advice, unfortunately I am yet to hear a response and looking at older posts, this question has been asked previously to no response, so there doesnʻt seem to be much active support for the course. I am stopping the course after the exercise as there does not seem to be much point continuing.",0,1,Alan Hudson,106409770

45056478~COURSE!~JVw44kxSEeiKBBJnjV2o_g,1627826632700,2,0,This course is not at all for beginners especially when you are a job person in parallel. There is less learning mindset but putting students into struggle is more obvious. No proper answer matching mechanism and in case of a wrong answer there is no hint for correction or missing point.,0,1,MUHAMMAD ASGHAR KHOKHAR,45056478
19922468~COURSE!~JVw44kxSEeiKBBJnjV2o_g,1587734233058,2,0,"This course is really good for learning QGIS and SQL queries for GIS. Being a civil engineer, I hope I can use it frequently in my job. The course content is good but the quizzes and assignments are really really time-consuming due to their format of evaluation. Since the course is translated to English, there are unusual pauses in sentences and the constant flow of speaking makes monotonous and hard to grasp the sense of the sentences. So. you must be attentive all the time. This course is good if you want to know something about GIS but not for certification. My suggestion is: just skip the quizzes and try to grab the knowledge.",0,5,Sudan Bhandari,19922468
42348207~COURSE!~JVw44kxSEeiKBBJnjV2o_g,1586841229850,2,0,"Take this course only if you want to learn QGIS and only QGIS badly. Though the lectures are informative, the quizzes will surely drive you mad. The questions are made as vague as possible and the checking system checks only the text. No matter you query is working or not. If there is even a single space missing as in the actual fed answer, the system will mark it wrong. The discussion forum is small and sometimes useful. Not many people are available there. ",0,7,Ayush Kumar Singh,42348207
118692553~COURSE!~JVw44kxSEeiKBBJnjV2o_g,1670871022357,3,0,"If you are not a native French speaker, the translations to English can be a little jarring and confusing at times. I speak French fluently and still found parts of this course difficult to understand as English is my first language. I would recommend the French version of this course if you speak French, but would recommend you find a different course in English if you don't. The information in the course was extensive, however the videos could get quite long. I would appreciate shorter videos with more quizzes in-between. The quizzes that are currently on the course could be better formatted so that more answers are multiple-choice instead of filling in a box where the formatting of your answer could be the reason you don't get a point. For example, you write ""shape and direction"" instead of ""direction and shape"".unfortunately, I ended up leaving the course halfway because I found a better course in English. I have to pay for this new course (from UC Davis) but it has so far exceeded my expectations and suits my learning style better.",0,0,Isabel Anne,118692553

53532856~COURSE!~JVw44kxSEeiKBBJnjV2o_g,1599114188510,3,0,This course really helps me to understand how QGIS works and gave me all the tools would need to start my development in GIS. I found a hard time with the quizzes at the end of the lessons due to translation problems and quizzes sections due to very specific answers. Something very important was the pace of the computerizing voice was annoying some times. Overall a good learning experience.,0,1,Carlos Alberto Salgado Lizardo ,53532856

Spatial and SQL databases through Spatialite can be a challenge for someone unfamiliar (like me) with these types of databases.  It forces you to think hard.
