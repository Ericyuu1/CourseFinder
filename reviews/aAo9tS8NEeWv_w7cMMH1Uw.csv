4822431~COURSE!~aAo9tS8NEeWv_w7cMMH1Uw,1475821140566,1,0,"The information was interesting but sort of long.  In fact, I started this so long ago that I don't remember most of what was said, only that it was long.  I did enjoy the first course, America's Written Constitution but someone was paying attention then and it was on the older format so it was better.  I rate the course so poorly, however, because of the total lack of staff involvement and the worthless peer review papers.  I have a huge problem with the peer review process.  It is of no value and should be banned.  Be that as it may, however, it takes weeks to get reviews and there is NO ONE FROM THE COURSE STAFF PAYING ANY ATTENTION TO THE COURSE!!  There is not one posting from course staff in the forums.  There has been no response to any of the so called, ""comment on this assignment"" messages I've been leaving since JULY.  There has been no response to an e-mail, supposedly sent to the instructor on my behalf by the Coursera help desk weeks ago.  It is obvious that the instructor has abandoned this course.  If no one is going to pay attention to it, it should be taken down.  If you just want the information, watch the videos but don't expect anything else, including any response whatsoever from this course.  I've wasted too much time on this.  I'm done.",0,3,Pamela E Marsh,4822431

By using his book as the notes for lectures, he doesn't give himself a chance to prioritize content so it's kept clear in the exposition. His favorite word is uh-um. In a classroom (face-to-face) situation, the lecturer is likely to see and react to listeners' look of confusion; in a studio he is just talking to himself. He repeats points -- this can be good if done smoothly but it's very confusing when the lecturer is inarticulate, like the present case. It's really too bad because he clearly has a lot of knowledge that could be used to popularize thinking about the unwritten constitution.",0,1,Harold Ormsby Jr,4140597
