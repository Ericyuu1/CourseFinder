64306929~COURSE!~P71s724mEeaWZAqzz79ZVw,1594046705851,1,0,"Horrible and Worst course I have taken. Information was too too repetitive, like really repetitive! The reason why is that some videos are the same like the intro the information about nanotechnology, graphs, the video about going to the lab and a lot of other things. Got very bored with the course when I was in week 3 and it made me lose interest. Videos are too long and is just straight explanation and no excitement. I give this a 1 star out of 5!!!

The lab sessions were really interesting and engaging. It is the presentation that I had an issue with. Most of the research students and faculties for that matter, had a very monotonous tone with many of them often reading from a teleprompter and not even looking at the camera. Although the narration was very well written, it was not very well presented, with the exception of a few. At times, it felt like an advertisement for the RTNN website. I would recommend this course for anybody looking forward to learn these characterization and fabrication techniques, and not to someone who's just passing through. ",0,0,Vivek KR,29164192
