But, the course delivery and assessment are horrible. There is little engagement and all she is doing is reading from powerpoints. There are no examples provided and no detailed study of curriculum given. The assessments are extremely tedious and not really based on what she is teaching but rather on what she means. I only passed because I am an expert in curriculum already. Again, if you know nothing it's fine.

The discourse between the two professors is a plus to the course. As an educator and short-story writer, it gives me an opportunity to dramatize my response. I believe that the peer-reviewed assignment should allow the learner to express his views to make his/her point. The learner cannot analyze an issue with five hundred words.
