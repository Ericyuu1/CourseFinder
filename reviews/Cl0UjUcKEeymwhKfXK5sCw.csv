90535643~COURSE!~Cl0UjUcKEeymwhKfXK5sCw,1651832386744,5,0,"This was my first dive into SQL and it was as smooth and informative as possible. My target was not only to get familiar with mail SQL operators, but also to understand the environment in which it is used. All this was explained in a very simple way. The course material is very good structured and the length of  each module was ideal for me as a full time employee and a mother of two. Also this was the optimal balance of theory and practice for me. Alan is a brilliant tutor! It is very important when tutor describes the backstage of the processes and warns about potential problems that could be faced because of this or that action. And Alan really inspires for further learning.To summarise, I would recommend this course to everybody who decided to start with SQL.Many thanks!",0,2,–ù–∞–¥–µ–∂–¥–∞ –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä–æ–≤–Ω–∞ –õ—É–∫—å—è–Ω–æ–≤–∞,90535643
