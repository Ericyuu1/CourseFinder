The only problem with this course is that it does not appear to be popular. I am now finishing the capstone project and it seems like we are 4 to 5 students active on the forums.When the grade is based on peer review, this is very stressful! I don't even know if the other students will complete and review my assignment on time before the deadline. To be fair with UC Davis, I think it is OK to rely on peer review for the first 4 courses of the specialization; this would reduce their workload. However, I really think that grading for the Final Project should be done by UC Davis. This will remove any risk of plagiarism and lift up the people who really worked hard on their project.In addition, I had some issues with some of my peers who made me fail an assignment, without any justification (this was in another course of the same specialization). I think it should be the duty of the UC Davis team to intervene in such a case, especially when you have such a small number of students doing the Specialization.",0,22,Anthony Lapierre,36295864

However the reason it does not get 5 stars is that when I signed up to the GIS specialisation in April 2016 I was led to believe that course instructors would review my capstone project. Indeed, this was one of the incentives for me in signing on to the specialisation. I realise that with the number of students undertaking the course this did not become very practical, so that the capstone project was peer reviewed instead. I found this somewhat disappointing though as the feedback gained was often quite limited and it reduced the value of the Certificate. ",0,11,Gary Scott,6493552
