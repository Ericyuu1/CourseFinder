The presentation in some of the modules is perhaps an example of how not to do it, reading fro a script in a monotonous voice.

It started off well and then the last few weeks of lectures I felt was random and didn't tie in as well as it could have. I understand wanting to talk about William Dick as it is a part of veterinary history, as well as where this course is from, but it felt like too much information and focus for one week. It would be great to maybe start off this course with a brief history of vet medicine and tools and that's it.There was course material on understanding terms for body components and directionality which is helpful, but then that was it. There was a large part about heart segments which felt out of place. This course is to provide some information to see a glimpse into being a vet. We get shown all the terms for parts of the heart and other organs aren't discussed. Perhaps breaking it up over maybe general organ locations or examples of what being taught without going into specifics for only one part. It felt very odd. That was then followed by respiration and then vet history and it seemed thrown together.

There is a lot of emotional investment in being a Veterinarian, often you have to walk the fine balance between animal's welfare and owner's economic capabilities, or find yourself before some ethical conflicts. This is a moment with rising attention to vet's issues as burnout, 'compassion fatigue', etc. that mostly stem from the fact our profession is (sadly) not all about animals.  All in all, it is a fun course, maybe a bit of a self promotion from the hosting university (which is understandable and didn't influence my rating), but to me it doesn't deliver on the question: ""Do you have what it takes to be a vet?""",0,33,G.

I learned much about myself and have a clearer picture around whether a career in veterinary medicine would still be a good fit for me. (dream I put off #life) I believe a combination of hands on study would help me to further my academic skills within this field. Additionally, I was very challenged in ways I didn't expect and in other areas where I expected a deficiency in my learning there was none. Either way I succeeded and passed my tests and assessments successfully and was able to delve deeper into areas I hadn't dreamed I would. The only suggestion I have is utilization of an interactive video for blood flow through the heart which would be greatly beneficial to many including myself. Thank you for such an engaging and engrossing program.  ",0,2,Quantina Beck-Jones,3439847

22445719~COURSE!~ClCx1sbdEeShXyIAC5MC2w,1478496898102,5,0,"This course was very interesting and gave insight to the kind of material first year veterinary students would be learning plus history of the profession (mostly the school).  The professors present actual anatomical (dissected) organs and histology slides.  I also thought the husbandry section well done.  The clinical portion is a little weak but understandably, given the medium and safety issues.  I still enjoyed it.  The history portion is a bit too in depth, I feel, and though interesting, spends a great deal of time on the history of the school and founder itself.  They are very enthusiastic though, which is a plus.  The course does a lovely job of presenting some of the various studies that go into this rigorous education/career, such as client interaction, anatomy, histology, animal husbandry, and examination skills.  It is so much more than just a love for animals.  I will certainly look into some of the other animal science-related MOOCs offered by Edinburgh.  I had no difficulty in completing this course in one week although I do have a medical background.",0,3,Laura Strand,22445719
