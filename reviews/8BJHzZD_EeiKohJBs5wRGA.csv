For example, they teach CNNs before gradient descent or the basics for training a model (like training splits or criteria to evaluate a model). Lack of order, toghether with confusing figures and poor metaphors, make impossible to properly understand any concept, and that can be seen in the discussion forums. In addition, there are gross conceptual errors, like suggesting that problems with non-linear solutions requiere NNs and can't be solved with linear regression algorithms. In fact, the whole course is centered in neural networks despite being presented as an introduction to ML and sells the idea that somehow NNs are the ideal solution to any non-trivial problem.

22289712~COURSE!~8BJHzZD_EeiKohJBs5wRGA,1672240270986,3,0,"Good introductory course, quizzes are alright, but the coding  assignments are a fail. I liked the videos, they give a founded overview over the mathematical and conceptual foundations. In fact, you can watch at 1.25x speed with no problems. The course skips topics like decision trees, knn, and r regressions other  than logistic regression, as that is the basis for neural networks. But it's all good, there's another course here tha covers these. NNs and applications are covered well. Quizzes are good, sometimes a bit ambiguous, but if you pay attention to the videos, well doable. My biggest problem with this course is the programming assignments. I think they display a complete lack of didactical effort or understanding of their students' perspective. I'm not talking about suggesting a python version from 2019 or so, that is incompatible with latest libraries which are also necessary for the exercises. Also the (recommended) Anaconda is probably the worst package manager ever known to mankind, I'm not going into detail. I ended up doing pip and it worked fine, just sorry for the lost time. The biggest problem I had was the coding assignments. The labs just present some code examples and go like ""you figure out the rest of it"". Not even hints or some master solution to look it up, after trying by oneself for several days.And even if you figure it out in the end, you're still left guessing why your 4 layer network does 96% accuracy, while the two layer network from the example does 99%. No comment, not even a ballpark figure how it should perform. There is some help in the forums, but to me the descussions there show that most people are struggling with that. Even having a reasonable background in linear algebra from uni and some Python experience I ended up  looking up stackoverflow and other resources for hours. Especially the NLP assignment cost me several days, bc the lab creators think it's good to swap a few dimensions in the input, as opposed to the rest of the internet apparently.  And skip over the batching in RNNs, because, yeah you go figure it out. In summary, I'm  not really convinced about this one.  On the one hand, good intro to understand the concepts and applications and you can finish in like two weeks, depending on how well you do on the labs, And of course if you can spend 1-2hrs per day on videos and quizzes. On the other hand, the conding assignments are frustrating as hell and I don't feel like I got any routine in pytorch. I guess more, but simpler coding tasks separating individual aspects, and some kind of help to get to a solutions, I would have given it 4 or 5 stars. ",0,1,Witold Drytkiewicz,22289712

If you're not interested in those methods or the aforementioned applications, I'd find a different course.- There are coding examples provided with simple written explanations, but otherwise this course doesn't focus on coding so much as discussions of the actual methods and algorithms. If you want to learn deep/machine learning coding libraries, I'd find a different course.- Based on the discussion boards, it doesn't appear that this course is actively maintained as of January 2023.

Watching them and reading the text will not give the student the skills to solve the assignments, forcing the student to search online for a better tutorial. I recommend providing the complete code to create a MLP, CNN, SWEM, RNN, LSTM and GRU. With a basic template created, the lab questions can then have the student change epochs, batch sizes, etc.I am aware that some basic templates were provided, but providing a SWEM and having the student convert it to a RNN is a huge jump. I took detailed notes during lectures and read the lab notes, but ultimately had to find other resources to complete the assignments, because the answers were not provided by this course.
