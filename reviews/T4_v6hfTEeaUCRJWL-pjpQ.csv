It is indeed a challenging course when we look at it from the point of how the information is showed and urged to be remembered. The professor is very well prepared and he clearly knows what everything goes about.For example the Trash Can Class was better explained that all the papers about the issue on the web. Still, this is a very bad organized course. The evaluations have a lack of interest in giving feedback and it's a terrible choice to have the final exam as a 111 question test. It is just very confusing and stressful. Every module is compose by some lectures, a module-quiz and a sum of talks of the professor with the students. Still, there is something very important, this course needs an urgent update. Given that the course was offered on 2012, I'm really surprised that Stanford did not pay attention on giving an upgrade or just making a new version of it with more updated content. For sure, social media, the world and more have changed the way organizations work and are analyzed by experts. One of the most unpleasant things in the course are the technical issues on the video. The green screen technology has a lack of professionalism, it gets boring to see a terrible and word-laden slideshow with no videos, no music, complicated concepts and more. The colors and the render of the video keep changing every time as if it was a wrong-connected projector and the eyes of the professor have been confused with the green screen, so you can see what it's behind. I mean, this are small issues, but I cannot shallow how one of the most important universities in the world ask us to be critical about the lectures and to give opinions about organizations when the course is bad organized, non-updated, and made without detail focus. It's a great course still to learn and re-learn about organizations, in my case I studied corporate communications in Mexico and this course gave me a new way to see organizations through other issues I didn't know. Good option to keep learning and to know more about important cases. I look forward for an update!",0,20,Emiliano Calderón,27178126

The provided PDF is very useful and contains lots of good content structured in a solid manner. The examples used to highlight the presented theories are mediocre; they are often either far removed from most people's experiences (e.g., Cuban Missile Crisis) or too education-focused or too US-centric; the instructor also often uses situations he faces in an academic environment as examples of applying the different theories, which is not interesting for people taking the course to better understand business organizations and/or people not currently enrolled in or considering employment in an academic institution.The quiz at the end of each week is mostly good, as it builds on the questions posed while watching the videos, though it's possible to answer them by studying the course's PDF. Some questions in the quizzes test attentiveness rather than understanding.The final quiz is, unfortunately, an exercise in memorization and reviewing the PDF content. There is simply too much nitty-gritty material covered across the 10 weeks of the course and there are too many contrasting theories and aspects to really be able to answer 117 multiple-choice questions in a row without questioning the point of it all.IMO the many-question quiz is an outdated way of checking for obtained understanding and knowledge, and some of the questions don't really mean much outside of the context of the course. For example: fine, I know that theory A differs from theory B in some minute way mentioned in a video or documented in the PDF. It's however very likely that this difference will not be something I will remember months down the road or something that will impact my application of either theory, so why focus on this difference instead of applicability of the theories on various situations?I applaud the fortitude and memorization skills of everyone who got 100% on it, though I cannot understand how that translates to proof of a better learning outcome than just barely passing and calling it a day, with the PDF as a useful reference to remember all the nitty-gritty.For those wanting to dive deeper, the Screen-Side Chat videos are very useful and often more insightful than the main course videos in answering ""what if"" questions, and I strongly recommend them.Overall, this is a very insightful and well-delivered course that was a good use of my time. It provided many ""aha moments"" related to my business experience in change and improvement initiatives, as well as regarding motivations of mergers, acquisitions, and general joint ventures. The course would benefit from a more application-focused and understanding-oriented means of checking the attendee's knowledge retention, but that's really nitpicking.",0,0,Isaak Tsalicoglou,8318375
