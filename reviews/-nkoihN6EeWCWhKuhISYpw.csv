70858894~COURSE!~-nkoihN6EeWCWhKuhISYpw,1600090255584,1,0,This course is poorly taught and very basic. The material is largely not related to data management and there was very little time to truly develop practical skills in REDCap. The lectures are first takes that have obvious mistakes (one guy literally starts over and they never edited this out). Completing this course is meaningless and does not provide any tangible benefit for employers and employees. The majority of peers did not do the assignments at all and their grading/feedback was not helpful.,0,3,Conner Imbody,70858894

A major issue with this course is the assignments being graded by other people taking this course, it would be fine as long as someone running the course checked the grades provided. One person graded my assignment incorrectly so I lost marks I shouldn't have, I wrote to the course admin about it and never heard back. These issues paired with the cost of the course (and having to pay extra for the certificate at the end??) does not make it worth taking.",0,9,Megan Lovatt,55077505

However, the worst part is the peer assignment grading system which I don't know if it's a Coursera thing or it depends on each university. I finished the whole course and still needed my peer grading from week 1 to get the certificate, and I had to repeatedly post and beg for other peers to review it until I got it, unbelievable. I wasn't the only one. I was shocked to see how many students have posted on the forum begging to be reviewed, and you start the game like ""I'll review yours if you review mine""...unbelievable. You can't leave a person at the mercy of others, you basically can't move forward until you get your peer reviews.

Some good points were the lecture video length (not too long for study in my free time) and the activities conducted in RedCap.

The access to a user-friendly automated tool (REDCAP) for class exercises adds a great deal to the learning one can achieve in the course.

But overall, the information presented is suitable for anyone interested in learning more about DM in the health field, and I would highly recommend this course.
