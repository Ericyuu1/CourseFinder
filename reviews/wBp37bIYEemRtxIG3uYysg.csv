68307704~COURSE!~wBp37bIYEemRtxIG3uYysg,1622549932418,2,0, The labs are not good. It would be way better to organize the whole course more like course #1 with more videos. This course seemed more like a really cheap one compared to the first. ,0,1,Sebastian Reimold,68307704
1305549~COURSE!~wBp37bIYEemRtxIG3uYysg,1590986240923,2,0,"I enjoyed the course overall and finished, but feel like it could be soooo much better. Really a wasted opportunity here. The video explanations were solid, but not near detailed enough to feel comfortable doing the exercises. Many of the Jupyter notebook sections were simply a lot of reading, no chances for the students to get some hands-on experience with actual coding. And lack of instruction plagued too many the exercises. This could be an outstanding course if more time was spent on going over more of the content in greater detail and building out the exercises.

33520672~COURSE!~wBp37bIYEemRtxIG3uYysg,1578778692064,2,0,"Course had good content, but lacked significantly in teaching videos and and feedback.  Lack of feedback included was within Jupyter Notebook (reading and programming assignments) and Discussion Boards.  Course took a lot longer to complete because of lack of feedback, requiring me to find outside sources (i.e., YouTube videos, internet articles, WikiPedia, etc.) to learn concepts presented in course and to complete required programming assignments.  Quiz content was well-supported within course content.     ",0,2,Christopher Aquino,33520672
37564853~COURSE!~wBp37bIYEemRtxIG3uYysg,1629253683197,3,0,"This review comes with two caveats: (1) this is not the type of material that interests me and (2) it is not the type of material that I learn easily.  Having said that, I think this course tries to introduce too many concepts without expanding enough on any of them. As a result, assignments are often just regurgitating code and substituting variables instead of doing any quality ""thinking"" about the topics. The last part of the course contained grammatically incorrect assignments and was difficult to understand. But, the course was put together very well. And, I recognize that my low rating might be more a result of my dislike of the material than the instructors or the course material. ",0,0,Lorraine Magrath,37564853

12588980~COURSE!~wBp37bIYEemRtxIG3uYysg,1627865824376,4,0,"I believe within the limited time duration of this course, it has done great to provide students some exposure to data manipulation/ data wrangling but definitely it doesn't touch on how completing this course can benefit Accounting students... Perhaps other courses in this specialisation will tap into that.
I'm quite sure that course creator has put a lot of thought into this, to see what they should introduce to students but a lot of googling and self-taught are required for those who want to complete this course. Learning this course can help you identify what each of your coding do to your results, so I think it is a great start. 
After this course, I think I still need to read more about Python and practice more. But great course.",0,0,Zoe Tuong,12588980
