There are two things wrong with this class:The professor is trying to teach this more as a freshman, first college class, blow your mind sort of experience than an actual class where students actually learn things. The issue is that he is so interested in doing that that he gives students so much incorrect information, he presents currently debated subjects in Social Psychology as settled and he lectures on things he is obviously not qualified to.For instance, he claims that violent video games cause violence. This has been repeatedly debunked since the 1990s and is not thought of as a plausible theory nowadays.  To take another example, Professor Plous declared(without evidence) that sex is just a category that people have made up with no basis in reality. Not only is this obviously incorrect but Professor Plous provided no evidence for this and he is clearly not an expert on that matter(he is a Social Psychologist, not a philosopher, biologist or geneticist).He is clearly just trying to provoke a reaction by presenting ""facts"" in an authoritative manner than actually teaching real social psychology.That is the first large problem.  The second large problem is that there is an obvious political bias to this class and the professor is trying to get his students to proselytize it. For the two honors assignments(pick 1 for credit) you could either:Try to get someone to vote for your political candidate in the 2020 presidential election(it is obvious which candidate the professor was trying to get his students to agitate for) or2. Try to convince a group of your acquaintances of the realities of certain ideologies taught in the class.  Complete with a set of leading questions that were over the line of being ridiculous.I was shocked when I saw these and now I am appalled at such blatant attempt to use a position of authority(professor) to try to influence politics in a Social Psychology Course.  A Psychology Course! That is utterly inappropriate and the professor should be ashamed.To conclude: If you want to learn about the field of Social Psychology, do not take this course. If you want get fed wrong facts in an authoritative tone, take this course.  If you do not want to get proselytized at about various issues the professor cares about, do not take this course.  If you want to get ridiculous assignments that include open electioneering in a Social Psychology course, take this class.",0,51,Jacob Nachsin,4810123

27955126~COURSE!~qLwmkiOZEeadsBKew8xmjQ,1642869595432,2,0,"The course had some interesting content.  I was familiar with many of the experiments discussed but it was good to see them discussed more fully.  The course had two major weaknesses, however.  First, the lectures often made sweeping claims about behavior without defining a metric for that behavior, such as the claim that people are bad at predicting their own reactions to situations.  What is the metric for such a claim?  How accurate does a person need to be to be ""accurate"" or ""inaccurate?"" On a related point, the questions asked of participants were often not well defined, allowing people to interpret them as they wished. For example, people might claim that a dispositional trait led to a particular behavior, but the psychologists claim that it is situational because most or nearly all people  behave in some way.  This does not differentiate between situational factors and moral agency, however.  If a bank truck crashes and spills money all over the street, it might be true that most people will pick up the money, although it is not theirs.  This can still be considered a dispositional trait because it is still dishonest to take other's money, and people have moral agency. 
 
Second, the course veered too far and too often into political polemics.  I would agree with some of the views presented but disagree with others.  In either case, I didn't take the course to be proselytized and many of the arguments would only be convincing to someone who was unfamiliar with the issues. ",0,0,Chris Neely,27955126

The course may be kept open till the last due date, and option may be given to students to pre-close it before due date if they want to do so.

I am so excited and happy to achieve this step and just from the first attempt. Before the course, I was alien to the social psychology field, even though it had attracted me much. I am a political observer, and after a while of being in this field, what I found to myself my work doesn't satisfy me in its evident form. Policy, economy and culture - the fields linked to people,  need a psychological approach. Trying to find answers to all inconspicuous through social psychology, we can actually understand the reasons standing behind the hidden curtains. There are a lot of problems that need different approach precisely by exploring the psychological factors. Our world is a picture of our thoughts. If we people feed our thoughts and feelings with hatred and offence we will cultivate villainy and atrocity. Unfortunately, we are aware of our fundamental essence what is created by God. I cordially believe in one person's power. I believe in one step, in one opinion, in one insight and in one perception. A building is starting from one brick. We are all humans that one brick of colossal construction. I summarised what I have read and watched throughout this course, that helped me a lot in constituting my life roadmap, came to the conclusion that actually all researches are based on the principle of one man and one decisive step. It was a miracle journey to my inner me, my self-world.  I warmly thank Prof. Scott Plous for his comprehensible and smooth style of narrating and rich sources presented for student's use. I recommend this course to all who wants either discover to understand ""Who am I?"" or predispose to make a significant and salient step in their life.

Everyone. after i completed the course i realised anybody who wants to know why people in general do what they do can take this course.Assignments/Quiz- One of the things i loved about the course is it's assignments.They are very engaging, makes sure one is thorough with the study materials as all the assignments are usually where we have to apply them while doing it. The assignments are fun and a great learning experience. there is one quiz at the end covering all the topics and with average difficulty level.I read in some comments before starting the course that there is pressure to join the ""social psychology network"" for a fee so i was a bit skeptical, but on taking the course i dont think there was a pressure, more of a suggestion and there are always alternatives present which one can choose. even if one does not join the network they can access the the materials from the website which is really cool.

course for anyone who wants to get a start into this subject matter.  The Materials are A+, and the
Lecturer has a strong, impressive background. You will also get to interact with

studies. Equally, you will get to mix with students from a wide variety of
cultures and backgrounds from around the globe.I would suggest that when you go into this course go fully prepared that

not rush through the materials as the concepts and studies are many and you will come out a better person for your input. One thing I assure you- you will have fun. ",0,4,Avi,31688885
