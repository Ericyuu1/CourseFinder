No one is commenting on anyone's posts anyway, which invalidates the point of posting things publically in the first place. Instructional videos are poorly produced and too loud in the app for the intro. Also, I don't need an intro segment for every video uploaded as its redundant. Instruction is campy vs scientific. Might work for others, but I am turned off and unengaged. From what I have watched so far, I have already heard this material from elsewhere.

I understand it was probably an effort to increase engagement but I actually consider to not follow the course when it seemed like there were so many of those. Also I think the 23 second intro to each video is accessive, it could be used in the first lecture but I was constantly just skipping the lectures forward after that. I also question about whether they should have included any mention of protein/eating because they really didn't give enough nutritional information, in my opinion, since this is targeted at a general audience what they said was very left open to interpretation which is good in some cases (and I liked what they said about steering away from supplements) but I feel like for others it could lead them down an unhealthy path.

pleased when you talk about the various benefits of exercise, not just for the body
