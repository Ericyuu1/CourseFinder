61519073~COURSE!~dYlOzglOEeW-USIAC8GCHA,1675185670414,3,0,I think the course should be more practical oriented that can inculcate software running skills in the students. The course is more theory based with limited exposure to practicals. For instance multiple examples be presented step by step to run software. Similar limitations were observed in the network analysis in systems biology.Thanks. ,0,0,Muhammad Shahbaz Yousaf,61519073

8688744~COURSE!~dYlOzglOEeW-USIAC8GCHA,1571835581784,5,0,I liked the case based approach and thought the choice of the papers was good. The approach of asking about the workflow of the paper was also a good point IMO. The case based approach really gives you a appreciation of all the steps in a complete study and how they apply different experimental techniques to 'prove' key aims of the study. ,0,1,Tim Roberts,8688744
