I learned a few things, although I already had experience in Sports Marketing.One thing I didn't like was the introduction of seemingly complicated concepts to explain simple ideas. For instance: Noon Nopi seems like a ""buzzword"" to convey the *very* basic idea of adapting to the audience and context.Also, most of the content from the Viral Marketing, AR/VR and Influence chapters are just common sense. These parts weren't challenging enough, to be honest. And I believe anyone who has lived in the digital era will feel the same.Also - this is be a very minor issue - the Professor's body language seems to be ""overdone"". It feels wrong. In case it isn't natural for him to point at the audience/camera, maybe he shouldn't do it. But please, professor, don't take it personally, it was a very minor issue. And I don't think I could do a better job :)I really liked the expert interviews. Especially those with John Davis, and the Audi Korea Head of Marketing. Good structure. Good answers.

The discussion forums were insightful and the questions made me think and apply theory to practice.  The length of each module was adequate and not too convoluted to follow.  I particularly enjoyed the interviews that were conducted with industry majors that allowed me to see the practical use for the topics discussed.  Great course! I'd take it again :),0,0,Jeanneth Jacome,24339780
