The course would benefit from being shortened; speakers need to be more concise, more pertinent. Making their presentation less of a chat over coffee and more of an attempt to convey their message simply by using less words. It’s almost as if they suffer from verbal diarrhoea. It would be helpful to reduce the length of the audios by 20-30%. The 20-30% gained could then be used to widen the reach of the course – dealing with issues that were not raised.
The number of bugs - or perhaps small errors is a better way of referring to them - needs to be very much reduced - more proofreading - more cleaning up - less repetition! Removal of misleading ""helpful"" suggestions relating to downloading audio – there is so much feedback saying this isn’t possible. It simply doesn’t work!

There could not be a more in-depth coverage of this mystical subject normally associated with the requirements of a Himalayan retreat or for being ordained under a monk; nor could there be a serenity that comes from experientially undergoing the course, thanks to a teacher who himself is a practitioner and the depths that he helps students of the course plumb for themselves to understand the how and why. I found resonance in the contents with Christ's teachings and could draw a number of parallels to give me a suspicion that maybe, there is some truth in the allegations that Jesus went to India - to learn under Buddhist Monks based in the Himalayas - before starting his short ministry in Israel. Whatever the truth, I have enournmously benifited from the course and my only complaint would be dear Prof. Chris Go-To Jones' tendency to use very long sentences when he writes those empathetic emails to graduates of his class, helping address each one's problems from lived experience. However, there could not be a more personal and genuine connect that evolves into a relationship from a  course taken anywhere on any subject - a continuous hand-holding, as one faces the reality of one's own baggage that can only be dealt with by practicing mindfulness.

I'd like to make particular mention of  JC Desai, who was the one that responded to most of my inquiries. I was impressed the quick response time.  And being new to online classes, I was a little nervous about a few things I didn't understand, so it was nice to know the mentors were there providing extra back up for us when needed.   If I had to make any constructive criticisms they would be:  1) That there may be a bit too much material for a beginning course.                             2) And the other would be that I didn't like that our passing or not passing the course depended on whether or not there were students available to grade our peer graded assignment on the deadline date. I was a little too close to the deadline, and was not sure if  there would be anyone left to grade my peer graded assignment.  As I understand it, that would have meant me having to do that part over again.  As it turned out that did not happen, but if it had, I felt it was unfair to have that as one of the last assignments.   All else was fabulous.

And I couldn’t believe it. Then I decided to send Congratulations Email to you for cooperation with totalizer regime of Iran, about Deprivation innocent people from their right of  education.  I have to say as a human I didn't choose this country for born and living and as a woman, I have been faced with cruel rules, critical problems and humiliations, because of the female gender.   I had enjoyed through the course, I had enjoyed from the concepts about making peace and communication with other people, but at the end, after study ridicules restricted rules, I realized there is a long path to reach and feel peace and free our heart from anger and have negative emotions together.

A good place to start for those new to mindfulness and an opportunity to broaden and deepen one's practice for more long-term practitioners.  A variety of religious and secular perspective are covered, both current and historical, with a view toward ethics and practical application.  The perspective presented is unbiased and encourages independent thinking, self-analysis and reflection.  It was well worth the time I invested and I intend to continue referring back to the notes I have made as well as the resources that have been provided throughout the course.

It not only de-mystefied mindfulness, but increased my own mindfulness, even though I have benefited immensely from a Vipassana course several months ago.  Dr. Goto-Jones has  navigated the controversial subject of mindfulness brilliantly by his own articulate manner of objectivity, while tackling topics such as religion, philosophy, and commercialization head on, without superimposing his own views, leaving the ultimate choice of what concepts and beliefs one wants to retain, modify, or discard entirely to the student.  To that end, his highly qualified, I even say, wise guests contributed significantly through their own views and/or exercise guidance.  I hope many more will benefit from this course in future.
