In general, this might be a good class for someone who has no experience in mental health or in academic circles. (1) Most affirmations during lectures weren't based on scientific studies. If it were, then the references weren't provided. Affirmations like ''3% of people experience psychosis'' needs at least a reference to a meta-analysis.(​2) The links provided in the lectures were websites. This works for high school, but not for a class given by a university. Also, some of them were outdated and didn't work.(​3) The lectures tone were friendly instead of academic. (​4) The exams question were confusing. In fact, they weren't really questions, but a sentence with a box. ''Essay refers to at least one lecture'' dosen't explicit what is expected from students to write in the box.

I am disappointed by the course. It is understood it is a
MOOC but it still doesn’t have to be this superficial. All in all
this course was a waste of time. 
The constant
repetition of the message that family and friends are of huge
importance is a slap in the face of all those who are precisely
dealing with issues caused by family and have no real friends. It is disappointing for a Positive Psychology course to presuppose that
everyone has someone close to turn to. This is not the reality for many people with mental illness issues. Moreover, the constant referral to a psychologist or psychiatrist to help in
emergencies does not reflect the reality of the Australian health
system where you have to wait for months to see any of these
specialists or pay a fortune. 
Also, I was taken
aback by the referring to Aboriginal belief systems in past tense.
This is very offensive for an Aboriginal person. Aboriginal
spirituality and beliefs are very real today. Please fix that
particular video ASAP.

Most of the speakers were really obviously reading a script behind the camera, and it was very weird to watch, I had to look away because it was so awkward seeing their eyes darting back and forth. I'd prefer a dynamic speaker who says 'this expert said this' than a boring expert (sorry guys). The eye thing was a real turn off, and some of them obviously felt really uncomfortable in front of the camera/teaching online. If they are going to read from a script anyway, better to choose someone better at on-screen facilitation (and get the expert to write the script!)2) The content felt quite disjointed in places; like it was trying to cram all things 'mental health' into one module, but they didn't align or synchronise. I wasn't sure what the main takeaways were supposed to be. Just a small small insight into everything, which felt confusing.3) The reading links were either a) outdated/a replica of the course content, b) didn't work or c) often were just random Australian website pages to join en event or workshop. This isn't 'reading for learning' in my opinion. They could've been much better. 4) Ultimately, I didn't feel like I learnt that much about mental health/psychiatry. It was very basic, and high level. I think I learnt more from reading books, but this course took much longer. I think this was because it was too broad, tried to cover too many topics and not enough time spent understanding them all properly. Thank you!",0,46,Olivia Hough,22432141

I am visually impaired but I successfully  worked on the assignments and attended all the recorded lectures!!! thanks and thanks a lot!I now have the experience in identifying mental illness, use of respectful language in describing the mental condition of a person (Person before an illness), the possible recovery options and understood the need for constructive lifestyle to ensure good mental health.Thanks and thanks a lot!!!I however did not succeed in using the NOX app player in my Laptop with JAWS software; not sure of the reason! I need to find out more because, I installed it with the help of a sighted person but though I have the latest JAWS verson installed, it could not read for me hence; I did not fully enjoy using the software independently and this calls for adjustments or double check for any user elsewhere like me who do not see, to have an amazing experience with full access of all the content. I succceeded in the course due to the fact that, I have an iphone which really helped to bridge the gap but not fully!
