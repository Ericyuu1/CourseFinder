1061147~COURSE!~IjzcekeSEeaL3g5tgt_P6Q,1567516335234,5,0,"This was the course I was looking forward to and it was fun. Dividing each week into 8 bars was smart. I was surprised that we were provided with the B-section and I felt a little cheated. All, I understand why we were told to use major and minor pentatonic chords but I was hoping for more flexibility than that. I feel like I need another course that would take me to the next level. One thing that I think could be added is for students to pick a song from a fake book, maybe in F or Bb etc. We could analyze the chord progressions and come up with a different melody perhaps. I think that would be instructive. For me, something like Billies Bounce or Blue in Green. I may still do that. Oh, the survey I did was for course one. I did not realize it was supposed to be for the entire four courses in the specialization.",0,3,John Emlyn Pugh,1061147
