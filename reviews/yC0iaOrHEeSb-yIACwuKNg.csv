Comparatively speaking this course can be made more challenging and I think it can be made as challenging as the ones offered by top universities in North America. And probably students can be advised to take DC and AC circuits first before taking this course. I like the way both the professors have explained the details thank you to both of them. I'm very proud that we have a platform where we can improve our skills that's why just to reiterate this course can be made more challenging. ,0,2,Rizwan Khan,81294323
