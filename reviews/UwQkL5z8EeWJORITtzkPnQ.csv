I am glad I took this course. A word about Larry DeBrock (The professor of this course). He is fantastic. I believe he has decades of experience in Economics. He made the course fun and inquisitive at the same time. I did hear from alumni that the professor may teach differently depending on the course taken (this is one of the courses that he teaches as part of MBA courses).
