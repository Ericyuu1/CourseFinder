78711488~COURSE!~CB_oYF2OEeuaew6diVe1Ww,1640711140437,4,0,The course was indeed helpful but did seem to be geared towards having some level of understanding of certain bash scripting functions. Overall a very good introduction.,0,2,Terrence Blacknell,78711488
39990131~COURSE!~CB_oYF2OEeuaew6diVe1Ww,1625995002260,4,0,The course is a good foundation to build upon. You need to have some understanding of terminal commands beforehand. Some of the topics aren't explained properly. But still considering it is not a course but a guided project I am happy with completing it. Accent might be a problem for some people. Also I had some problems with cloud workspace it was lagging very frequently.,0,1,rajiv kumar Kale,39990131
