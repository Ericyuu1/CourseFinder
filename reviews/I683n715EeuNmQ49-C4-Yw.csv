The short videos were very helpful to explain specific ideas; the course would have benefitted from more videos and walk-throughs of solutions to exercises in the text. Throughout the course, the student is asked to complete exercises in the text but there are no solutions offered in either the text or the video, except for a couple of times towards the end of the course. Seeing the coding solutions and examples are necessary as a learner. If you struggle with developing a code that works and don't have a live instructor to ask or email questions to, the student must rely on web searches to find coding solutions. If you are going to offer a course that has no live instruction or support, you need to provide more coding examples that can be referenced after the student tries on their own.",0,1,Cynthia May,114098204

I wish that the assignments submitted by fellow students would open into the online lab area instead of downloading. Many of the students submit screen shots are other potentially harmful files that I do not want to download and risk running on my computer. Although I'm careful with what I download, it still exposes my personal device to unnecessary risks.",0,1,Adam Sayler,5513256
