110427132~COURSE!~zVzG3kcJEeymwhKfXK5sCw,1664290690406,3,0,"T​he material is OK. It gives a good overview of relational database design. The course is not rigorous and the assignments are easy, although they give the user a chance to practice, if even at a minimal level. The grammar of the instructor is bad. I've had to look up several concepts taught, because the instructor was not able to adequately describe the material. He would fail elementary school English grammar. I can forgive the instructor's poor pronunciation, although it did get in the way a few times when he pronounces words so incorrectly that it seems he is saying just the opposite of what he intends. I had to rewatch several concepts due to the poor grammar and pronunciation of the instructor. Mind you, I speak several languages and have lived and worked in foreign countries and know the importance of correct grammar and pronunciation to adequately express thoughts and concepts.",0,2,Richard Lyons,110427132

We were asked to answer questions like ""according to you, what is the most important take away blablabla"", and the answers were graded by the other students. This is a course about database design, is there no way to make an objective evaluation of the students' progress rather that some subjective bullshit that depends entierly on one's ability to write a story ?",0,5,Philippe Cotte,46813748
