Yet, I did not know about much of this course content. The lack of attention that Patrick Henry gets in the historical narrative of the revolution and years after is tragic.

law & studies from outside USA, I found this an extremely interesting and
beneficial course. Prof. Ragosta has put exceptional efforts into defining
Henry’s personal life, family, education, legal career, political life and
ideals. Moreover, he has also cleared certain misconceptions about Henry in
great length, including the tarnishing of his image in certain areas.  I do have few fundamental disagreements on: [1.] Henry’s
views towards Slavery (I didn’t feel that Henry was against slavery at all),
[2.] Rivalry between Jefferson and Henry (I don’t feel that the collective
evidence presented is sufficient to state that Jefferson was hell-bent on
tarnishing Henry’s legacy) and [3.] I don’t feel that Henry understood
Jefferson and Madison’s concerns about the excessive over-regulation,
discrimination and tyranny in Adam’s regime, although it was pointed out that
Henry was strongly influenced by the French Revolution and the view on ‘anarchy’
towards the end of his life.  Nonetheless, I strongly recommend this course to anyone. Kudos
to Prof. Ragosta for putting exceptional efforts, his knowledge, sense of
humour and captivating lectures. ",0,1,Anujay Shrivastava,19701149
