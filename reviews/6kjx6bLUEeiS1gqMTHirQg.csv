65923912~COURSE!~6kjx6bLUEeiS1gqMTHirQg,1602799666771,3,0,"The course itself was good and thorough, however, the work load went from just quizzes and a simple, easy peer reviewed assignment to a snowball assignment that was a lengthy report for the last week. I was quite shocked by this and I think the assignments should've built up to this.",0,1,Stephanie Primov,65923912
1556786~COURSE!~6kjx6bLUEeiS1gqMTHirQg,1573933210822,3,0,"This course is very interesting. It gives you an overview of how to run user tests. The workload is too much skewed towards the end of the course, which makes it a bit too hard to complete. There were some things missing in the materials, I think. For example, I didn't learn how to properly code critical events during user tests, so I had to just ""figure out"" what to write down. Qualitative data analysis was also not 100% clear, so I fell back on my intuition. Nevertheless, I found the skills in this course really valuable.",0,0,Daniel Morillo Cuadrado,1556786

However, the scope of the final assignment is a bit too large, and would have ideally been split over two or more weeks. The instructions were a bit lacking as well, and while there was a lot of space for flexibility, this isn't very easy to handle when assignments are to be reviewed by peers. ",0,0,Snigdha,62327630

210720~COURSE!~6kjx6bLUEeiS1gqMTHirQg,1547111423621,4,0,"This course was excellent. Although the assignments were very hands-on and useful, they proved to be a bit too demanding, leading to some students not finishing on time. This led to the evaluation taking ages, and thus I had to pay for a month extension. This is the reason I'm not giving it 5 stars, not the assignments themselves, which I liked, but that fact that I had to wait literally weeks for other people to grade my assignments, which costed me money. I'm also not very happy with the fact that courses 4, 5 and 6 don't still have an open session, so I'm basically blocked for more than 2 weeks and I can't continue my path. For that reason, I will cancel my subscription until these courses are open.",0,0,Juangui Jordán Aldasoro,210720

But I can recommend this course 100% in terms of content. The videos and content are very high quality! A lot more professional / orderly than the face to face school.  I chose the specialization, I love the course and I can implement some of it every day. However, at the end of the day, without ETCS, I will not be promoted nor will I get a pay rise at least here in Switzerland. Apart from that, it's 100% worth it.
Pro: Super professors!Very good content, deep enough and well organised.
Very good slides to apply directly.

Contra: 
Only everything that concerns an online course. (and you probably already know.) 
No recognized diploma
No contact with the professor, work is checked by fellow students.
