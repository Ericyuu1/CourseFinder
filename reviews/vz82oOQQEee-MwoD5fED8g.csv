4138534~COURSE!~vz82oOQQEee-MwoD5fED8g,1526496071560,2,0,"I find this course shallow. The videos and materials are very short and never get into any depth. I did not find much substance in the course. The only useful part for me was the peer discussion and seeing the opinions of other students.It is more effective to find a good science-journalism article on the topic of genetic data privacy, rather than to do this course.
