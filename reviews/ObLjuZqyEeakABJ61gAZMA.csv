31985712~COURSE!~ObLjuZqyEeakABJ61gAZMA,1593772368584,3,0,"There were a lot of errors in the lecture transcripts, and the lecturer's accent was so pronounced that correct transcripts would have been useful for anyone, let alone for someone who needs to rely solely on the transcript. Someone only reading might end up wondering what saxophones have to do with treatment rooms, and what on Earth is prime stalin dose profile... The solutions to the quiz questions were not obtainable from the course materials in many cases, especially the ones with calculations, and while they were mostly basic,  to be frank I find it subpar course design to not make sure the material matches to the questions, without making it clear that the course requires the student to find information outside of the course material. The graded quizzes were identical to the practice quizzes, which makes them mindless repetition. Also, because the questions were vague in many cases, it would have been easier to do the practice quizzes with trial and error (unlimited tries) than finding out by googling what the question is about (the English of the questions wasn't always too easy to interpret).
