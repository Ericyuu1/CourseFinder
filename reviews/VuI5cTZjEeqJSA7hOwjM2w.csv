The course is designed universally for any foreigner so it covers pronunciation of all the sounds, thus those explanantions might seem a bit excessive when explained sounds exist in the mother tongue of a learner. But that's a plus, I just wish there was a bit more specific course for speakers of my native language so I could focus on the most challenging sounds more (/w/, /h/, th and s/z sounds in the positions one after another). 

What I really lacked is explanation of some consonant combinations that are pronounced differently and are not obvious for non-native speakers, by that I mean -mb endings like in words: comb, womb, tomb, bomb etc Maybe there are some other little secrets of consonants pronunciation I don't know still.
