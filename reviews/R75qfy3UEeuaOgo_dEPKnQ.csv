110749572~COURSE!~R75qfy3UEeuaOgo_dEPKnQ,1665246469794,4,0,"Overall this course effectively explained the various reimbursement models and gave some history about how health insurance began and how it has evolved into the current system we have.  It is clear that the current system is unsustainable and that changes must be made. Where I have a difference in my opinion about the reasons the US health system has evolved into what it currently is. The blame is set squarely on the shoulders of the providers as the main reason for increasing costs.  There is no mention made of the contribution for profit healthcare systems have had in this dysfunctional system. For example, one or the sponsors of this course Humana made a huge profits in 2021.  I quote from Fierce Healthcare ""  In the second quarter of 2021, the insurer reported $588 million in profit for an increase of 18.4%, according to its earnings report​ Humana also brought in $23.7 billion in revenue for the quarter, an increase of 14.6% from the $20.6 billion reported in the second quarter of 2021. ""  The CEO of Humana made over $16,000,000 in 2021.  The medico-legal enviornment which clearly drives up cost was not mentioned and the general societal attitude of "" do every test"" , expensive and uncessary end of life care among many others  requires a complete shift in policies and hopefully attitudes.  I feel this course contained bias that needs to addressed.",0,0,Jeffrey Alper,110749572

28535125~COURSE!~R75qfy3UEeuaOgo_dEPKnQ,1646320088245,4,0,"Very insightful course for professionals needing an insight and levelset into the value based payment model. The additional resources information in my case is very helpful for anyone curious to get more clarity on some of the concepts and topics introduced in the course. I reduced 1 star as the oral narration on some of the sections of this course was way too fast. I've taken a few other courses on the value based secialization series and didnt face this issue. It will be helpful if the delivery is a bit slowed down to give the listener time to digest, comprehend and sink in the content. Otherwise, content wise loved the bases covered and makes me feel more confident about my foundational understanding of value based payments and with this foundation,  I will be able to build on more knowledge from my work experiences.
