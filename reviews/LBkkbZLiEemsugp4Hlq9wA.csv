One can study the basics of auto-correction, Markov and Hidden Markov Models as well as the N-gram models and very important approach - Word2Vec, which is the essential part of the modern deep learning algorithms. I really enjoyed this part. However, there are some minor suggestions: 1. Lectures duration could be longer - it will help to provide more depth in materials in both math and code side. I know that this is a simple version of real academic course, but in order to increase the quality you should consider the increasing duration;2.  Programming assignments are not balanced and there are still some minor ambiguities. For instance, the first and HMM assignments are tough, whereas the last one is a piece of cake.3. The course can be enhanced with the additional part dedicated to Probability Theory, maybe a few lectures more.I recommend this course to everyone interested in NLP.

There seemed to be little or no TA support. Many people were posting questions and not receiving answers from TAs. I posted the mistakes I identified in the course content, but I don't think anyone is going to act on this. It would have been good if the last exercise were repeated in Tensorflow.

I'm glad that they tended to focus on the basic and essential concepts and not on the details too much like data cleaning although they do show you how these things are done too.  But there are really a lot of things to digest.  These courses can potentially fit into semesters in school but I think they successfully covered the important materials well.  I especially enjoyed learning new things like hashing, dynamic programming, and Markov models.  I found the labs to be very helpful because they helped divide the amount of material to digest into smaller portions.  I also found them very helpful for the homework.  Although some people didn't like the short videos, I actually liked them.  They were mostly to the point and they were easier for me to review.  People comment that they miss Andrew Ng's lecture.  Unfortunately, I don't think Andrew can teach many more classes because he's busy with many things, although that would be awesome.  However, I think that Younes did a great job of teaching.  If I understood what was said and am able to do the quizzes and homework, then I'm good. Eventually, we're gonna have to work and think independently, anyways.

48546862~COURSE!~LBkkbZLiEemsugp4Hlq9wA,1611601042235,5,0,"This course gradually ramps up the sophistication and interest from the first course in the NLP specialization.Week 1: Autocorrect and Minimum Edit Distance is OK, nothing to write home about but gives you a sense of how a basic autocorrect mechanism works and introduces dynamic programming.Week 2: Part of Speech Tagging explains Hidden Markov Models and the Viterbi algorithm pretty well. More of a sense here of learning something that will be a useful foundation.Week 3: Autocomplete and Language Models explains what a language model is and builds a basic N-gram language model for autocompleting a sentence. Again, good foundations.Week 4: Word embeddings with neural networks was for me the most interesting part of the specialization so far. The amount of lecture & lab content is considerably higher than in the previous weeks (which is a good thing in my view). The pros and cons of different ways of representing words as vectors are discussed, then different ways of generating word embeddings, from research papers dating from 2013 to 2018. The rest of the week focuses on implementing the continuous bag-of-words (CBOW) model for learning word embeddings with a shallow neural network. The whole process, from data preparation to building & training the network and extracting the embeddings, is explained & implemented in Python with NumPy, which is quite satisfying.I found that the labs and assignments worked flawlessly. They are largely paint-by-numbers though, I would have liked to have been challenged and made to think more. The teaching is pretty good, though there's room for improvement. It tends to focus a little narrowly on the specific topic being covered and has the feel of reading a script. What I would like to see is more stepping back, thinking about and explaining the larger context of how the topic fits into current NLP and the student's learning journey; then engaging with the learner on this basis. I did feel this course was a little better than course 1 in that regard. Overall 4.5 stars but as there are no half stars, I'm going to let week 4 tip it up to 5.",0,0,Dave Jenkins,48546862

I must say, once again the balance between mathematical formalism and hands-on coding is just on point! This is also not easy to achieve. I quite enjoyed also the infographics about the word embedding model developed during the course. I have been reading blog posts and papers about the technique for some time now and I did not see any best explanation than the one in this course, chapeau! Nevertheless, there are also points of improvement to consider. One of my main concerns is that at the end of some assignments, there is very little discussion about the validity and usefulness of what we get at the end. Although in the motivation a lot is being put forward. For example, while building the autocomplete, there were a lot of time dedicated to motivating why is this useful and why one should learn, but at the very end of the week, when we finally build one with tweeter data, there is very little analysis on these results. This is a bit frustrating. Of course, one cannot build very useful models while in an assignment in a Jupyter notebook, nevertheless I am positive that you can find also here a good balance between analyzing the model's outputs and inquiring if indeed we achieved the goal we set at the beginning, and if no, why not, etc. Clearly, assignments are not research papers, but a bit more careful treatment on that end will make this course achieve its full potential.
