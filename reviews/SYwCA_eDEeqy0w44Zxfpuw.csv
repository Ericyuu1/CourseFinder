24615908~COURSE!~SYwCA_eDEeqy0w44Zxfpuw,1624034387647,4,0,"This was another good course from SAS and Coursera.  I felt that some of the presentations were hurried and quite dense and I had to review some of the videos several times and use other resources, but on the whole, this course covered using SAS for regression modelling well.  Definitely not for someone without a solid background in statistics.",0,0,Tom W,24615908

Thank you Coursera and Instructor Jordan Bakerman for teaching and sharing this course.
