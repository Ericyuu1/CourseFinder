111089743~COURSE!~JSv_tqavEeujrAoup8YoCw,1661529702087,4,0,"This course was a great introduction to how the media responds to requests from PR practitioners for coverage of their stories. I learn about AP writing style, components of press releases and press release pitches, how to relate to journalists, and how important it is to keep the audience in mind, as well as provide newsworthy press releases. The peer-review assignments were challenging and I really enjoyed having the chance to research and write a press release. It can be frustrating waiting for your peer-learners to actually review your assignment, but patience pays off in the end.",0,0,Diana Waterman,111089743
