By readinf its title, one could reasonably infer, at least I do, that the course deals with how mitigation must be different between developed and devoloping countries as well as among developing courses, taking into account local contexts such as resources, sociall demands, different climates, etc.Actually, the course is about a defining a ""super-wiked"" problem and the building different models scenarios. The authors of the course have implemented these tools in some developing countries but they could be applied just the same way in developed countries.Best regards,Adrien Poisson",0,0,Adrien Poisson,74751146

I would like to suggest:1) to change the name in order to make clear that it is about the specific MAPS approach and not about ""climate change mitigation in developing countries"" in general terms.2) to integrate development professionals and some policy analysis / political decision making experts in the revision of the course but also in the MAPS approach in order to make it more effective or relevant for climate governance. 3) to include (more) content about low carbon development and climate change mitigation strategies in some key sectors in the development context in order to increase the benefits for students interested in mitigation. 4) to reduce the parte about the own difficulties of scientists and engineers when interacting with politics and stakeholders.5) to try to simplify the MAPS approach to make it more accesible to governments and regions in more poor countries.
