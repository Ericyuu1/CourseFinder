It's a regular engineering work that requires way more than couple hours to be done carefully (unless you design quadcopters for years).I only finished it because it was the last task of the course series, but the task is completely irrelevant. It requires only extremely basic Fusion skills.I would be much happier with some production-related task that suggests developing a part optimized for a prescribed set of manufacturing tools... or something like that.The long discussion of the quadcopters on week4 was a complete  waste  of time for me.

I personally wanted to learn more about CAM. How do you design for different processes and what do you need to consider for different processes. This course touches on this slightly, however, I would say that only makes up for around 15% of the content. Relative to the Digital Manufacturing specilisation, it is a decent course, but, it is probably too specific to quadcopter design. It is fantastic to have an example which runs through all the courses (CAD, CAM, CAE/FEA), however, the course seems to be purely based around this. This of course is counterproductive to an extent, because then you only learn the tools and processes behind making one thing (although it is a complex part).I have given 3 stars because it is very well structured nonetheless, however, it should really be re-advertised. If you already know a decent amount about CAD/CAM, I would say stay away, unless you wish to learn about quadcopters. ",0,0,,37208966
