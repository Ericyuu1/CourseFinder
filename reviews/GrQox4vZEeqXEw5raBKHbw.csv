1228965~COURSE!~GrQox4vZEeqXEw5raBKHbw,1673120452091,4,0,"This is a really good course. I learned a lot. The OpenStax text is excellent. Professor Hafner is excellent. The only negatives for me are that in order to do all of the homework problems, you will likely have to do some additional sleuthing beyond the text and the lectures. Also, the auto-grader for the homework can be finicky. I spent a day banging my head against the wall because I entered ""m"" for mass instead of ""M"". I also learned by trial and error that subscripted variables should be entered as m_1, rather m1. Nevertheless, this is a really impressive job by Rice and Coursera. I liked it enough that I'm on to Energy and Momentum.",0,1,Tom Beatty,1228965

The only complain I have is that faculty and teaching assistants are not very active on the forum. People normally wait for months before they get a reply.",0,1,Anurag Garg,63194864

We were on our own with very little instructor interaction  and had to deal with our own questions.  I would recommend more support from the teaching staff.",0,1,Lisa Filanosky,79253234

111385043~COURSE!~GrQox4vZEeqXEw5raBKHbw,1668480846971,5,0,Jason Hafner's lecture videos made this course a joy to follow. There were one or two  problems in the homework assignment I felt ill prepared for and I had to resort to the internet to find similar problems (which did deepen my understanding so not necessairly bad) and a tiny problem with parsing in one  of the answers but  overal the combination of clarity and fun in the lecture videos more than made up for everything. If you want to get a basic understanding of physics I can highly recommend this course. (presuming I now have a basic understanding of physics ;-) ,0,0,Floris Kooij,111385043

As the professor says, real learning happens when one is confronted with challenging problems, and this course provides many interesting ones. I learned a great deal, not only in physics but in problem solving in general. Looking forward to the next course !

3370584~COURSE!~GrQox4vZEeqXEw5raBKHbw,1612309577564,5,0,"Course was excellent, but a few of the questions in the problem sets had a wrong answer coded into the parser, making it very frustrating to try different options until finding the one that worked, even though it was wrong.  I made sure to point out those mistakes using the feedback option in the questionnaires, so they can be fixed in the future.  Also, the parser when working with symbolic answers was wrong in several answers, working for example with ""mg"" instead of ""m*g"", which should not happen, since ""mg"" is nothing but a constant.  I hope these are fixed for future courses.  But all in all, it was very satisfying.",0,6,Gabriel G,3370584

A real step up in complexity as you head into the exams, so be careful on that. But we're here to stretch ourselves, not just repeat what was said in the lessons.A nice piece of light heartedness with the stupid physics tricks at the end of each week. Gives us something to look forward to!Looking forward to doing the other courses on this specialisation.",0,3,Timothy Hills,74467245

25965969~COURSE!~GrQox4vZEeqXEw5raBKHbw,1608776605485,5,0,"Dr. Hafner is a fantastic teacher, he illustrates concepts with concrete examples and provides demonstrations and historical tidbits that reinforce them instead of leaving you only with a mathematical treatment. He does this in an entertaining and funny way too, but don't be fooled, the treatment is fully rigorous and is similar to what you'd find in a freshman calculus-based physics course at a respectable university. For this reason, you should come already knowing things like trigonometry and rudimentary calculus (basic derivatives/integrals). The course loosely follows a free text book online which offers readings and additional exercises, it's optional, but if you are seeing physics for the first time you might need this resource.The production quality is very high, and you are treated to silly demonstrations each time you complete a problem set. A fantastic specialization, much better than the competition from other top schools (I've used them too), you come away with a stronger conceptual understanding and the rigour to back it up. You'll only wish your future physics courses were taught this well.",0,5,Jack,25965969
