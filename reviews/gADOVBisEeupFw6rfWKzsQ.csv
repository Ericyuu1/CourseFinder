43893550~COURSE!~gADOVBisEeupFw6rfWKzsQ,1609164978058,5,0,Abby Saey's courses are some of the best Project Courses I have come across in Coursera. Her explanation is easy to follow and she covers all important tips and tricks clearly. This particular course is very useful as it teaches how to use the Eduflow platform for Employee Onboarding and Training. I highly recommend this course and other courses by Abby Saey. All the Best!!!,0,0,Bensen Alex,43893550
