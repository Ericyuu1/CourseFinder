68155925~COURSE!~iSz7OEC2EeWBrBIWi3mmCw,1617021217766,1,0,"This Course did not meet my expectations, which were fairly modest to begin with: all I wanted was to learn a bit more about Inferential Statistics. Instead, I got nothing from the course, apart from a short introduction in R (this was the only good thing about the course and the reason for the 1 star). The course structure seems logical, but the way the lessons are made is really bad. Videos are short and lack any explanation whatsoever (this is the whole point of a lecture - to explain!). Anyone who is doing this course is already at a computer and can google any formula for any of the presented concepts. What I wanted to see is a good explanation of why we use the said formula. Unfortunately, the course doesn't offer any. The quizes at the end of each week do not give explanation for the wrong answers. There is no way for a student to understand and learn from failure. It's strange that the course has such a good rating on Coursera, when most of the course's forum is filled with messages from frustrated students, who have similar complains as I am. The course may be suitable for someone who already knows these topics very well and only wants a certificate. For someone like me, who actually used all these tests in practice with statistical software, but wanted to understand the reasoning behind the tests and formulas, this course is a waste of time. That is my biggest regret: I wasted a lot of time without learning anything.",0,0,Alexandru Gudima,68155925

They just spit formulas and formulas and formulas - as if we did not have statistical software to help us - and rarely provide good, objective and clear explanations of concepts and etc. I mean, all the tests assumptions, 'when to use' and benefits are there, but are shadowed by the enormous amount of formulas and statistical tables (all the hard work that we can easily simplify on R or Python, really. Furthermore, some week quizzers need herculean efforts to complete. Not because they are hard, no. But because if you answer something wrong, you have to do that again, because it doesn't indicate your previous answer. The quizzes also don't explain where you got something wrong and how to solve it (I mean, they say 'check the forum', well good luck with that. I am still waiting for some comments on the post I made on the forum). Furthermore, bad-wording is common on some quizzes and sometimes it is not specified to which decimal place I need to round my results. For real, I failed the week 4 test 3 times because some answer was something like 1.66667 and mine was 1.6667. Please, INDICATE HOW MANY DECIMALS I NEED TO ROUND.

I often have to go to other sources to clarify what was meant. Also frustrating is that there's no feedback on the exams, you're left to guess what you did wrong.

Oftentimes new concepts are explained and gone within seconds, and it largely comes down to memorizing formulas rather than understanding them. It seems like the lecturers were reading off a script that does not necessarily take into consideration the capacity of a student who just began learning inferential statistics.I don't know - if one is already somewhat familiar with the materials or a genius then he or she may not have a problem following the course. But I, having had a reasonably good knowledge in basic statistics before the start of this course (obtained good results in both offline and online upper-secondary school-to- elementary freshman level basic statistics courses), frequently had to watch other MOOCs (e.g. there is a great course on inferential statistics on Khan Academy - longer videos for the same topics but they let you grasp the principles firmly) because I simply did not find the course videos sufficient.On the positive side, I found the R-labs helpful. On top of that, quizzes and exams were quite difficult for a MOOC, which sometimes caused frustrations but still forced you to put a significant effort to learning.On the negative side of the difficulty, sometimes I was stuck with utterly no way to proceed in the quizzes. Forums are not very active. Because the lectures are short and packed with content, they often did not contain any hands-on problem-solving procedures, and the student is left with abstract concepts and formulas at the quizzes.

Here's why: *** The slides are beautiful and visually appealing, making following the rigorous content easier to digest.  *** Instructors are captivating and articulate, the explanations are clear and concise. *** The assignments are very very tough, making the course incredibly challenging, but worth it. Honestly, I don't get why people give 1 star because the course is tough. This should be a huge plus. It was a real challenge getting 100% for everything. For every quiz, I attempted 2 - 3 times to get 100%. The challenge is worth it. I couldn't thank you enough for this course. You explain tough statistical concepts like the difference between prediction intervals and confidence intervals really well. Also, I think this course has the best teaching for Analysis of Variance (I have taken a few other statistics moocs). Also, your course helped me appreciate the meaning of R-squared, standard errors, confidence intervals in a very intuitive fashion. There are many other new things I've learnt from your course, some of them I thought I knew, but you helped me to either ""Aha"" or understand them more deeply.Before this course, most of the time statistics to me is like plug-and-play using procedures and and softwares. But now, I can understand the concepts and what the calculations really mean.Thank you for creating quizzes that make us really do step-by-step calculations and not just plug data into equations to get results like so many other statistics moocs do.The pedagogy is really great. Sometimes quizzes can be frustrating because I need to read very carefully into the meaning of the questions and all the options. However, the learning experience is really worth it.Again, thank you for an amazing course!

14332189~COURSE!~iSz7OEC2EeWBrBIWi3mmCw,1460836421878,5,0,"The course is great, I feel like I learned a lot. One thing that I would have found very useful, however, is feedback on the quizzes — sometimes it is very difficult to figure out what went wrong. This could be implemented by giving people a choice to see some feedback and then no longer being able to re-take a quiz, so people can't cheat but still get positive feedback.All in all, it's been a pleasure! Thank you very much!",0,0,András Bárány,14332189
