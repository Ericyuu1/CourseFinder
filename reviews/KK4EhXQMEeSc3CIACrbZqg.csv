The Bocconi tutor is clearly knowledgeable of the subject and I learned several things I did not know about PPPs. There are however many things that are frustrating with this course. The assignment tests is one of them. They are written in poor English and clearly not checked by an English native. Also, the pass rate of 80% and the way it is calculated is very annoying. There must be a better way to test this subject on. For instance, if you select the wrong answer in a question, maybe link it to the course content where you can find the information, or explain why it is wrong in the answer sheet. The course also needs an update - I believe this was done in 2015. A lot of talk about the financial crisis in 2008/09. In general, I still don't think I hav a good concept of PPPs after taking this course. Too little time spent on the actual structure, the different types of contracts, consortium trade-offs, key contracts and key negotiating items, more examples of successful and unsuccessful PPPs, how the market has developed (e.g. private infrastructure market and PPP share of private), new trends in the industry, drivers of PPP growth, and more.
