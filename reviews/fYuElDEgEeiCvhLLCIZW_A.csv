121061552~COURSE!~fYuElDEgEeiCvhLLCIZW_A,1677530857323,1,0,"Great example of what's wrong with technical training. Lot's of syntax that you won't remember unless you are already familiar with it, (often intrusive) quizzes on syntax that you've only just seen (sometimes for only seconds), important themes and ideas lost in the implementation details, covering too much material at a superficial level instead of less material and actually learning it, skipping over the necessary mathematical/statistical background in order to quickly advance to blindly coding, skipping over the broader understanding of the (multitude of) libraries that were used in order to go right to using them, and meaningless labs that give the illusion of deep understanding but are in fact cut-and-paste fests devoid of understanding. I'd rather have taken a slower course in just pandas and a separate course in the linear algebra and statistics being used (with some math pre-requisites). I was also recommended this course immediately after finishing part 2 of introduction to python and I don't feel like I have nearly the python background that this class assumes, however I guess flaws in recommendations are not necessarily flaws in this course (unless it purports to be perfect for python novices).",0,0,Joseph Alacqua,121061552

This was due to the following reasons:1) a lot of interaction with not working IBM infrastructure. It took me around 3x as much time to get required things working on IBM cloud and IBM Watson compared to the time spent for actual assessments. It is annoying if it's getting that obvious that IBM wants to use the course to promote own products. This is sad as we all already pay for the course...2) There occurred quiet some arrows in the labs which even after months (according to the discussion) have to been corrected.3) The amount of hands-on training in the notebooks/labs was really small. It was not a lot one had to program on their own and the parts which had to be programmed were only an exact copy of what was already done before. Even the final assessment did not really contain a real task.4) Many concepts weren't explained in depth. The explanations just stayed very superficial. Some concepts like fit()/fit_transform() which appeared in the labs weren't explained at all in the videos or in the labs. This led to a lot of confusion as could be seen in the discussion threads.As we all pay for this course please increase the amount of actually explaining concepts in depth and the amount of real in depth hands-on training and reduce the parts on IBM Watson and other such stuff.

Why cram so much into this one class!  The material is broad enough that it should be covered in 2 classes not 1.  And as I've found in all the classes in this certificate program, there are not enough problems given to help students exercise all they are learning.  There should be problem sets (with answer keys) given after each week that helps to drive home the important concepts.  These could be optional, but I think it is imperative that students have an opportunity to work through more problems to help lock all of this important information in.  There should also be links to places to go to learn more about each presented topic. And the amount of errors in both the videos and labs is really bad.  The class preparers (IBM) have done a horrendous job of catching and fixing the multitude of errors in the videos & labs that simply lead students astray.  They have to find some method to get all the material correctly updated quickly and I suggested they should keep an ERRATA PAGE that lists all of the known errors that haven't been fixed yet.  This would help them to keep an active punch-list of what has to be corrected and allow students to more easily check if a problem they are seeing is related to incorrect materials without having to scrub the forums to try to find answers.  And the forums are not run very well.  It generally takes a day to get any answers and the answers are not very thorough and in many cases just wrong.

However there were too many small disconnects in the course, especially between the video voice-over and the slide material.  It was like the video presentations were not sufficiently quality checked to make sure her spoken words matched the written words.  In weeks 4 & 5 there were a couple of times when she named one function and the slide showed a different one.  When one is still low on the learning curve it is very important that the consistency of the material is solid. When there are needless ambiguities in the material, valuable learning time is lost trying to figure out something that is more ""container"" than ""contents"".  This stalls the learning process and can create a lack of confidence in the material.  Good but it could have been better.",0,2,Wayne Kurtz,27746111

 This course on data analysis with Python started with basics and covered topics on preparing data for analysis, performing 
 simple statistical analysis,data visualization, predicting trends and patterns to have  meaningful conclusions.
 Course structure is nicely organized with step by step lectures with quizzes at interim levels aided by practice session.
 Course has an interactive window which is similar to Jupyter NoteBook so that learner can practice their learning within the online course itself.
 Moving forward to applicate these leanings in automating domain specific tasks in my portfolio.
