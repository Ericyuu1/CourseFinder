63925820~COURSE!~20cUeRNfEemsugpc-osVtg,1619192658285,1,0,"The structure of this course is in my opinion is poor.
The majority of the course is just a collection of reading material, most of which is simply not necessary. This course would be better served by clearly structuring the course material, providing only necessary reading that re-enforces the learning pathway.
While I appreciate the work that has gone into the course to bring this material together, most of this the reading material is repeated, the learner is expected to read hundreds of pages of documents, most of which is simply irrelevant.

It would be more efficient to simply ask the learner to read a book on privacy, as at least this will have a structured approach.

I feel as though the course was very quickly patched together, throwing any pdf document into the mix, that may have a slight connection to the actual learning material. This makes the course extremely tedious to understand, and leaves little room for learner motivation.",0,1,Ulrich Rivers,63925820

Answers to questions of Quiz 1 (after Week 2)  are found in Week 3 and 4, and the issue is left unresolved for at least 8 months (judging from the discussion forum) I​ had to google to pass the quiz as the names mentioned in the questions were not even mentioned in week 2 at all. I would say if you are self-motivated and are not willing to explore, the course coordination is not an issue for you. ",0,1,Chak Kuen Chong,104853987

20196745~COURSE!~20cUeRNfEemsugpc-osVtg,1670334621251,4,0,This course was awesome. Learned a lot about privacy laws in the USA. This also gave me prespetive on  two school of thoughs regarding privacy; privacy as economic ommodity and privacy as fundamental human rights. For me personally i think we should take privacy as fundamental human rights and not as mere economic commodity.,0,0,Bijaya Budhathoki,20196745

São clássicos no tema da privacidade americana, porém também apresentam documentos muito atuais. Um ótimo curso para se aprofundar no tema da Privacidade dos Dados nos EUA.
