5184607~COURSE!~iCIGe_T6EeS-1yIAC7MN4w,1585647423954,1,0,"Whilst a significant improvement on the dreadful first course in the specialisation, I found this course frustrating and poor in several key areas. Firstly, I am a Biomedical Informatician with several years hands-on experience and am looking to build up my skills in Systems Biology, and I hoped this specialisation would help with that. Based on the first two courses, it doesn't - at all.Firstly, whilst the lecture videos are much better than in the first course, it really adds little to investigate lab procedures in such detail. An overview of how they work and a focus *on the data produced* and to how that are relevant to models based upon differential equations would have been excellent: this only happens in the final week! The instructor has never posted once in the discussion forums since the course began and there are issues reported with the quizzes which appear to not have been rectified - so the quality control is poor and I found for me personally, much of the material was irrelevant to my aims and objectives in taking the course.Coursera really have missed an opportunity with this specialisation: the MIT Synthetic Biology course offered by edX is excellent, even though it requires a very high degree of background knowledge it doesn't shy away from the materials (it required too much Molecular Biology for me though it's an excellent course). ""Experimental Methods in Systems Biology"" *could* have been excellent - IF the material of the final week of lectures had been the majority of the coure. Very disappointing and, honestly, a waste of money in my honest opinion.",0,7,Paul Godden,5184607
75849788~COURSE!~iCIGe_T6EeS-1yIAC7MN4w,1609652896981,3,0,"3stars for the lab video, -1 for quizzes, -1 for the long lecturesThis course has the best lab videos to offer. I have real experience for most of these techniques so I should be qualified to say that the course is extremely helpful to those who will touch on these stuffs. The concepts and the principles of techniques are covered comprehensively but could have been more concise; the lectures are generally too long. The major downside, as others have pointed out, is that the quizzes are not well-organized. There are too many confusing multiple choice problems; the tester clearly did not know the choice should be independent. I've passed this course with 100% grades (with a lot of attempts and trying) Some answers are clearly incorrect if you lookup the literature; the tester should consider some techniques would be improved overtime and therefore some limitation will be lifted, but this course will stay on coursera forever). Furthermore, some problems are not covered or not emphasized in the lectures. ",0,2,Guolong Mo,75849788

108619152~COURSE!~iCIGe_T6EeS-1yIAC7MN4w,1659136180138,4,0,"I will likely come back to finish my specialization at another time.  The course content itself was truly excellent.  Very comprehensive and I especially appreciated ""going into the lab"" and seeing the experiments being performed real time.  I also was glad for the case studies, the readings and being able to download course content.  The only thing I was very unhappy with were the quizzes.  Specifically: 1) many of the questions seemed to be written by grad students rather than the professor. They were both immature and overly complicated.  2) Some of the content in the quizzes was not related to the course content/at a level beyond what the course teaches.  3) There were typos, sometimes the author(s) forgot to remove their notes as to which were the correct answers, while conversely some of the language was overly and unnecessarily dense.  This course shouldn't be about assessing someone's language ability or my ability to interpret what the writer was trying to communicate. I'm not talking about scientific language either.  4) The multiple selection questions are simply ineffective, especially since the feedback on them is all or none.  It was very unclear which in the multiple select you selected right or wrong out of the 4 or 5, and therefore you didn't/couldn't learn anything from your mistakes.  As a teacher myself I know that multiple choice questions are not great for assessing in-depth knowledge.  But at least you can learn from your mistake(s).  To summarize, the course was great, the quizzes are a frustrating mess. Thanks!  ",0,0,Carmine Hanks,108619152

However, I think the assessments need some reconfiguring or at least better support for discussion forums/advice on how to approach them. Some quizzes contain very vague questions, typos, and overloads of information. I often found myself just trying to figure out what the question was truly asking. I do like the essay approach as it integrates knowledge well and makes for a challenging exam. It has been noted by several students in the discussion forums that Quiz 1 in particular has some questions that seem to have no correct answer (I spent time going through the permutations myself just out of interest). Overall, this course was a great overview of experimental techniques in systems biology for those willing to invest themselves in the literature in particular, but the assessment structure and implementation was lacking at times.
