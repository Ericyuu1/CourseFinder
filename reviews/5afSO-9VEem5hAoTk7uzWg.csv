This was a top-notch course that I literally did for fun - I have no need for coursework, I am completely done with that portion of my life.  What I appreciated about this course was the level of information that was presented - it was fairly advanced for the layperson yet made very approachable.  Dr. Wilson has a great enthusiasm for the subject matter (a GREAT enthusiasm) - and uses real-life research examples to populate his lectures.  Personally, despite having had a statistics course over 20 years ago, I learned more here than I did in my college class - and these lectures are done in nice short ""soundbites"" so you do not get overwhelmed.  The use of technology, yet not being beholden to it - and having a great stage presence in communicating makes the lectures enjoyable.Additionally, while this course seems to be a couple/few years old, Dr. Wilson has taken the time to add up-to-date, relevant COVID information to the course as time has passed.  This is a bonus.  Having been both on the student and teaching side of things, it amazes me to see teachers/professors/instructors who will never update their material (this is at all levels of schooling and even here on Coursera).  On top of which they will use ""peer review"" in grading/teaching (which is beyond ridiculous and the ultimate in laziness); and around looking at other courses here on Coursera many have even dropped whatever help there was when those courses were first offered 6 years ago (I would stay away from those courses - those ""peer review""  assignments will kill your grades if you are going to take them for certificates - read through the syllabus and the reviews).  NOTE TO COURSERA: PLEASE DO A FULL AUDIT OF YOUR COURSES (AND LOOK AT THE COURSE OFFERINGS AND REVIEWS, THE STUDENTS ARE LARGELY RIGHT) - IT MIGHT BE TIME FOR SOME OF THE PROFESSORS TO UPDATE THEIR MATERIAL OR HAVE IT REMOVED FROM THE COURSE LISTING.  None of that happens here.  It is pretty straightforward (it might be why there are so many 4 and 5 star reviews, oh, plus it is just a good course).  What you have in this course set up by Dr. WIlson and his staff: lectures for each week, after the lectures a medical paper to read, then a quiz based on the lectures/paper.  There are forums and Professor and assistant are available for questions.  FYI - I did not even fully read the papers at the end, internet problems on my end, so I am getting out with a ~85% if I wanted the certificate.  And that is not with trying very hard - as they say, you get out what you put in. ",0,0,Yasemin Tulu,6363769
