122085463~COURSE!~q4WjaqgaEeuCfAr94DTRdQ,1675861946756,5,0,"I liked the course very much. It gives a nice overview over urban health and provides some planning ideas and examples. For my taste, it could be a little more in-depth. For example, introduce more theoretical planning approaches or show more projects that deal with different aspects of improving urban health. However, I definitely liked the combination of short videos and reading papers, which is similar to university teaching. I also liked that you embedded interviews, opinions, and experiences of experts from different countries. Thank you and greetings from Berlin.",0,0,Julian Anders,122085463

41195652~COURSE!~q4WjaqgaEeuCfAr94DTRdQ,1664723164614,5,0," This course serves as an insightful overview of the prevailing perspectives, both historical and current, on sustainable urbanization. A ever-increasingly important topic to deal with, as more and more of the world’s population are occupying urban rather than rural localities, the offering shares a multi- and interdisciplinary approach that puts human and natural well-being (instead of the profit motive) at the center. The cities of today and of the future should be smart, green, healthy, climate-resilient and, most importantly, sustainable – lest our species and the ecosystem services we rely on continue to be imperiled by an increasingly-inhospitable world. Everyone living and have experienced being in a city – virtually all of us – can relate to at least one major point from the shared material, and this can be an impetus for advocacy to make urbanization sensible in our various localities.",0,0,Aedrian Abrilla,41195652
