The good part about the course is the case study approach to teaching which makes it easier to apply in a practical setting.,0,0,Varun Reddy,19000859
47162759~COURSE!~fn1ZVMZlEee_GgpOk9kbPg,1583604544068,2,0,"The instructor was very dry and the information was presented in such huge chunks, it was difficult to digest",0,1,Guenivere McAllister,47162759
73712563~COURSE!~fn1ZVMZlEee_GgpOk9kbPg,1604672909654,3,0,"I am grateful
to the course organizers for putting it out there.As a
general introduction, the course needs a better explanation of how its different parts
come together. For instance, Part 1 sessions on organisations and change does
not link up with the last few sessions which introduce Health Systems. The
presentation of the sessions on organisations and change is overloaded with
detailed personal experiences of the lecturer, there are no references to where
the models come from, and the models themselves don‚Äôt seem thought through.Week 2 is
much better than Week 1. I think the view of the PHC is obsolete, same as the
WHO‚Äôs view of it. Nowhere in the world does PHC fulfill all the roles expected
of it, including education and social mobilization, or ‚Äúfixing the local
markets‚Äù example. With the amount of money allocated to PHC in M/LICs it‚Äôs not
realistic to expect all that. I did like the HS building blocks explained on
the example of the malaria program, I found malaria more relatable than the
example in Week 1. The ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù session is informative and the one on
private vendors is interesting, although a bit repetitive, and there‚Äôs a
mismatch between the voice-over and the slides in a number of videos. What I
really liked in Week 2 is the matrix of the Global Fund CSS blocks and the
community systems.Week 3
seems an improvement in setting the stage and good overview at the start of the
lecture covering the main elements. I do not understand why, while the course
is on health systems, the practical assignment is not on health systems, but on
organizational change.Week 4
material on policy making makes an important highlight of the responsibility of
policy administrators, and I liked the comparison between the different policy
formation models. The lecturer is spot on about the detrimental impact of
WTO/patents. The lecturer‚Äôs accounts of advocacy implementation are a clear
value-add.Generally I
think it would be best to have a separate course on organizational change and on
health systems/community systems. I do not think the health systems and the
organizational change parts of this course blended well together.Some
detailed observations are: the course could benefit from mentioning
sources/providing reference links. Also it would be great if there was a
possibility to fast-forward/rewind by 10 seconds, like on Netflix üòä I personally find many of the
illustrations/pictures used to be a bit dated, and more diversity in the images
would be welcome. The image on slide 10 of Week 2 struck me, it‚Äôs about
nutrition, on the image there are two smiling men who are at a table with food in
front of them, and there is a seemingly sidelined woman holding a child who
sits at the edge. It would be good to mention something about the role of
gender or intra-family food security! I think sometimes the lecturer goes in
too much details on the clinical aspects of different tropical diseases. I do
appreciate the time, effort and resources that were put to produce this course,
with a few changes the course can improve.",0,0,Nonna Turusbekova,73712563

37619689~COURSE!~fn1ZVMZlEee_GgpOk9kbPg,1588927720647,3,0,"The course format is not particularly student friendly. Relying solely on videos in which the lecturer presents field experience over a slide deck that is not always synced with what they are saying is not exactly the peak online learning methodology. Adding some readings, linking additional resources that the students could explore (the JHU website has multiple amazing online tools), breaking the very lengthy course videos into smaller pieces would make for a more impactful educational experience. On top of that, the peer review system is not exactly fool proof, and even after you have successfully submitted your assignment, one can wait for multiple weeks before obtaining the certificate, as there is apparently not enough peers to review the submissions.  The discussion forum for the course is filled with people asking for reviews. That being said, the course content is interesting and I believe that the whole Foundations of Global Health is potentially quite useful for people looking to cement their GH experience and knowledge. For people who are only getting started in the Public and Global Health, I'd suggest taking the course ""Essentials of Global Health"" from Yale University which is for free, a lot more interactive & student-friendly and introduces students to multiple online tools that are useful for further research and better understanding.
