13430936~COURSE!~udpGdb3wEeesZwqFmMw-wA,1614366782124,4,0,"The course is, in my view, of high interest.  Not only this course, but both of them I would say, Ferrous Technology I and II. I am, by training a Doctor in Mechanical Engineering and my majors have not been Metallurgy or Steel making, as they were only something more or less marginal in my studies. Now, being retired I felt a renewed interest in the study of steel and steel making, being also well conscious that steel making has changed a lot since I left university and new steel specialties, microalloy steels, lightweight steels, etc. have appeared in the market and this circumstance  made the refreshment of my knowledge of steel doubly interesting. Both courses, I and II have been engaging, full of condensed information and so I would recommend anyone who would like, or need to come to grasp with the steel making state of the art, to follow these courses, Ferrous Technology I and II. Thank you Pohang University for a well done job !!As suggestions to improve the quality of the course I would mention : 1) Sometimes the text that accompany the graphs shown is too small in size to be read in the computer screens. I would suggest to make them bigger. 2) It would be convenient to give a bibliography with book references that a student that would like to deepen into the given concepts could use for that purpose. 3) Sometimes I have had problems in understanding the English of some lecturers but this is fully understandable, as none of them were native English speakers. In any case the available English subtitles have helped me to overcome the problem.",0,0,Juan M Sansinenea,13430936
