6478918~COURSE!~bbRq8eTnEeqnpA6eTsnlnw,1651007589933,5,0,"This has been the best Python guided project I have taken so far (of six). The instructor explains everything clearly, and provides additional code snippets to illustrate the algorithms and data structures they generate. The solver strategy is explained well, as is the recursion. Where I struggled to follow, there was usually a clear illustration in the following code block, and I took my time to comment each of the sections to improve my understanding.
