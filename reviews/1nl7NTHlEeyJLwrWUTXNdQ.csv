I didn't know anything about any conspiracy theories, until the pandemic changed everything. (Right now it's Jan 1, 2023, in the USA).   Unfortunately, now it seems like a good idea to know some of the most prevalent and violent ones out there.   :(After taking this course, I'm not sure I feel better about the conspiracy theories circulating here in the USA!   But I do strangely feel relieved that conspiracies have always attracted a certain audience, and have been around for a long time, and the world didn't end, so we might all be ok after all.Peace, and hoping 2023 is better than 2022 for everyone!",0,1,Kathy Conner,60421895
