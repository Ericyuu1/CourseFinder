6923489~COURSE!~ZNeGqEC2EeWC4g7VhG4bTQ,1660961039238,1,0,"I found this course very very difficult with a complete lack of real learning support. The discussion forums are clearly not monitored, not even on a weekly basis, with dozens of posts dating back months and years that have not been responded to.The course description was completely inaccurate in it's estimation of the time that would need to be spent to actually learn the content and do the weekly assessments. The content is great, and it covers a good range of basic statistics, but the teaching videos are so dense, I would have to watch each video at least twice, and spend time pausing and rewatching in order to take good notes. Often taking between 30mins and one hour for each video. I often had to search online on other platforms for better explanations of the content.It was not made clear in any of the course information or introductions that we would need to learn a new piece of software in order to complete the course, and I think that for this basic level of statistics learning R is not an appropriate software. It involves coding and is too advanced. The interaction between Coursera and the Datacamp platform where you learn R is poor. I wasted around 9 hours working my way through the first 5 chapters of R on Datacamp because there was no notification or mechanism to tell me that I had completed the introduction. It prompts you to carry on from one chapter to the next, and into the graded assignments without telling you that you have completed each section and that you should go back to the Coursera platform to learn new content before moving to the next chapter of R.I only persisted with the course because I needed to complete it to get into a masters program and because it is cheap. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, and I will be sending feedback to my university to tell them to take it off their list of prerequisite options. ",0,0,Gina Moss,6923489

The fact of aborting the subjects in a very fast and superficial way leaves something to be desired and ends up generating a lot of confusion both in the course and in the programming part. I would need more examples and activities so that knowledge could be absorbed more easily and intuitively. There are some calculation errors in the videos and the lack of some references associated with tables Z and T that generate a lot of doubts and confusion.
Anyway, I expected the course to be more organized.

The primary reason why I took this course was because I wanted to learn basic statistics without using python or R. Unfortunately for those of us who just wanted to learn statistics, this course requires you to learn R, which is something that should be made clear to people before they purchase. As for the rest of the course, the first two weeks are done well. While the concepts are presented quickly, those two weeks have the benefit of having a ""summary"" video at the end in which all of the concepts are brought together using an example. Starting in week 3, a different instructor presents the material. His primary goal seems to try and speak as quickly as possible without explaining much of anything.  In fact, he will sometimes slur or stumble slightly over words due to this. The slides used in the videos are also riddled with errors., as pointed out by people in the discussion forums. Despite all of this, week 3 was still manageable because the material presented is very simple. As you progress through the course, though, and as the material becomes more complicated, I felt like I was just plugging numbers into formulas without really understanding what I was doing or the concepts behind those formulas.All in all, save your money and go to stattrek or another site if you actually want to learn statistics.

The content starts from descriptive statistics, moves on to probability then basics of inferential statistics which include estimation and hypothesis testing.However, I gave it a 3-star for its inaccessibility. If you use a screen-reader with this course, you would find that most of the stuff would be inaccessible. The lecturer instead of saying out the formula on the board, just points to them and assumes you are seeing them. In that respect, you may need the help of someone to help you. To me, this defeats the whole purpose of learning: You need to be independent. So you end up guessing or making some readings outside the course if you want to pass.A big plus though, goes to the R Labs by Datacamp: I think this course helps anyone new to statistical computing.

However, there were no practice problems besides those in the videos, so there was basically one or two examples of each concept. It would be extremely helpful to have practice problems. I don't think that including practice problems and feedback would be that technologically difficult. Just a few multiple choice questions per lesson with comments explaining why a choice is correct or incorrect would be immensely helpful. The quizzes are somewhat like this, but the feedback is minimal. Alternatively, this course might include questions during the videos similar to in the Quantitative Methods course in this series.

I am aware they could have organized the practical part with some other tools, but for me R is a necessity and a must. However, there are some drawbacks. 1. The presentation quality between two instructors was noticeable. Somehow, one of them was repeating more, had a slower pace, more vivid examples, which I prefer. 2. There are several important mistakes with numbers in the presentation slides. Many students have already noticed that, so it's a pitty no one corrected them. 3. This drawback is more for DataCamp, and not for this course, but the spelling was really bad. Too many obvious mistakes. 4. Final test. It was quite demanding for me.

I came away with what I wanted: a basic grasp of key concepts in statistics that previously I had merely a superficial understanding of -- standard deviation, confidence interval, Pearson's r, etc. The video lectures were fantastic: clear, engaging, fun. I liked that I could pause them when I was confused on a point. A couple of criticisms, though. First, I found the r program frustrating at times. Sometimes it was used in a way that helped me to better understand the course's key ideas. But too often it was an exercise in guessing the obscure programing code to use. Since I'm unlikely to ever use the program again (and I suspect this is true of most students), overall I found the r programming of limited value. The other drawback of the course -- not your fault! -- was the same problem with all on-line courses. At times, I just wanted to ask a question or get a clarification on a point, but that just wan't an option. Finally, I think it would have been helpful had you provided an in-depth explanation of how to arrive at the correct answer for each question on the quizzes. For the quizzes, I was usually able to figure out the right answer (eventually), but not so for the final, which didn't provide any explanation as to why I got certain questions wrong.

The course has not provided learners with sufficient materials, such as standard z-table, t-table, etc. Several concepts are not thoroughly explained (the P-value, for example), perhaps due to their toughness, so good articles with elaborate explanation on these concepts would be a great addition.
