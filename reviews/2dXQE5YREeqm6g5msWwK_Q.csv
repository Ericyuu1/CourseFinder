115170335~COURSE!~2dXQE5YREeqm6g5msWwK_Q,1671402687893,5,0,"Why we the Learners need to WAITING SOME other learners to Review our assestments  before to finish the course? Why now we are dependent from that? I do not like that because WE all giving efforsts and energy to Learning, spending hours, days, and in the end we need to waiting? Why is so complicated? We need to Reviewing and voting because we are obligated to do in order to receive votes from others... tand who knows When...? The other learners also votoing because they should be voted by other learners etc etc...? I do not like that because instead some teacher or professor to review my assestment, my work,  it should be done by learners as me who even will not read my assestments...they just need to do it, so to open way they to get votes back some time... but when..?! I finished other coursera courses and there was not complicated. Just make the grades assestments like test quiz, get 80 % and that is.What makes You more different/special from other courses so to make it so complicated and fake? Learners to vote for another learners assestments.. if they vote for me after 1, 2 months? I finished my study and now i am waiting...? And its not only 1 assestment. They are 3,4 assestments waiting....Its like Paragraph 22. I am dissapointed from the process of this course.",0,0,Dani Alex G.D.,115170335
