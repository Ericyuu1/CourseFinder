Labs of that course basically based on some tutorials where most of functional code cut off. The way code cut from tutorials leave no chances, especially for beginners, to fill the gaps by themselves. For example, ""Build sequencial model"" #your code is here - without any guidance on what layers should be used, how much of them needed, which specific parameters need to set up. Even knowing what is possible to fill the gap, beginner unable to define from scratch which architecture is relevant for this case. S​o there is only way to coplete notebooks - copy/paste.
