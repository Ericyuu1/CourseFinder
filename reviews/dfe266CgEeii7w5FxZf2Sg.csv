The teaching method is extremely tedious as no innovative methods to explain the concepts have been used. If I am doing a course from Imperial College of London, I expect it to be something with a leading edge. If I wanted to look at a person talk & add simply attach invalid links for reading, i'd rather deploy Google & YouTube. ",0,0,Dr Shreya Bhardwaj,58867886
