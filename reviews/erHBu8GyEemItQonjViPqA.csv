86987467~COURSE!~erHBu8GyEemItQonjViPqA,1629280694835,1,0,"I feel that Michael has tried to cover a lot of points in brief and in theory but the structure was not followed properly, as in storage was discussed in later weeks whereas it should have been discussed earlier. For me personally, it missed usage around Azure portal much and was a lot theoretical. Practical usage and probably simulations would have helped alongside. T​he final exam missed feedback page where it showed correct or incorrect answers. Few of the questions seemed wrong having written to select 3 options but where only 2 applied, and some with multiple options to select but no fixed no to choose given.",0,0,Jasdeep Singh,86987467
399165~COURSE!~erHBu8GyEemItQonjViPqA,1618093385708,1,0,"Final Test does not provide feedback on question but only score. Additionally score does not change if you try to retake the test, unless you get an additional question right. If you select an additional wrong answer the score still shows your maximum score.More that all, the questions are NOT all covered in the lessons.It was by far the worst course I have taken in Coursera.",0,1,Margherita Bruni,399165
50026919~COURSE!~erHBu8GyEemItQonjViPqA,1610015027641,1,0,The final exam is not straight forward with ambiguous answers for some of the questions. You are not able to know which answers you gave were wrong which makes it difficult to score more than the pass grade and get the certificate. This is very frustrating.,0,11,Samuel Wambugu,50026919
73937189~COURSE!~erHBu8GyEemItQonjViPqA,1608352232794,1,0,Exam questions are not set properly and for few the answers are not in-line with questions. Still I cleared the exam with 81% :-)  These questions are good for Azure Administrator or Architect exam but not for fundamentals. Please work on the questions and give proper option / answer to select. 1 STAR is more than enough due to the poorly set of exam questions. ,0,1,Kuldeep Nerlekar,73937189
72986183~COURSE!~erHBu8GyEemItQonjViPqA,1603097905723,1,0,This was a terrible course.  The labs don't work and the final exam is horrendous!  I would NEVER recommend ANYONE take this course.  The instructor couldn't pronounce simple tech words... it was like he didn't even know the subject very well himself.,0,6,Chris Leonard,72986183
