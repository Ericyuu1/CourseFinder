Additionally because the lectures, lab, and quiz used all the same examples this means we would see the exact material presented over and over with no clear pedagogical reason.Additionally the course seemed overly preoccupied with OOP to the point of replicating the functionality of several built in pyTorch classes obfuscating the actual material with no clear reason given for why we were creating our own version of extant classes.Lastly, the quizes almost never asked any questions about pyTorch.

46170544~COURSE!~sPepfpkeEemvnQ4fUTFrrA,1588772537209,2,0,"This course is difficult to rate as a learning experience. There are some very good parts yet there is also some very poor material. I would say that if you are already very familiar with machine learning and Python BEFORE taking this course, you can still draw some useful learnings on how PyTorch can be applied to various problems, and how to create convolutional neural networks with it; but if you are uncertain about some of the key concepts, this course may only end up making things worse for you.To give an idea of the problems, there are issues like: -	When explaining the train/validation/test data logic and how validation data can be used to prevent overfitting, the videos keep calling training data test data. -	Pytorch is used for some really fancy stuff like defining functions and datasets, but then those functions are not parametrized in any sensible way – meaning if you want to compare loss functions from two different initialisations of the model weights, you are expected to define a new function so you can just change the variable “LOSS” to “LOSS2”, rather than just passing the loss function as a parameter or just initializing or returning it. Given the Pytorch logic is not your regular Python stuff, a best practice should be provided – it is definitely not writing a new function every time. So be warned: if you know what you are doing, and simply want to learn how to do it with Pytorch, this may still be a decent course for you, just ignore all the stuff where the instructors make mistakes (and they are plenty, also in incorrect quiz answers). But if you feel at all uncertain, I suggest you hone your machine learning skills elsewhere, because otherwise this course will leave you totally confounded on even the very basics of machine learning.On the upside then, you learn Pytorch through repetition. In the beginning, the logic appears very intimidating, but then you gradually learn the logic and you can do some very impressive stuff quite easily in the end. Be prepared for the amount of repetition, however - first the stuff is shown on a video, then you run the exactly same stuff in a lab, and unfortunately the Skills Lab is not at all efficient for some of the stuff - I ended up downloading the notebooks and using them on my Watson Studio account for much faster performance.",0,3,Juho Härme,46170544

I found that to be more confusing, they use far too many colours and are too liberal with their use.-Lastly, the labs completely broke down in the second half of the course. My understanding from the course staff is that an upgrade was made on the backend which did not go well and thus caused those issues.

A large amount of information has been compressed in a short period of time. The synthesized speech runs too fast. Slides on videos also change too fast. Some of them appear less than a second. A learner has to pause or even rewind a video to catch and explore them for understanding.Multiple errors in lab solutions (I would call them even bugs). Some of the proposed solutions do not follow requirements specified in preceding cells.Wrong information in slides. For example, 'hidden layers' instead of 'neurons in the hidden layer' or 'hidden neurons'.Too many spelling errors in videos, quizzes and descriptions apparently made by non-native English speakers. For example, two instead of too, ture instead of true, supper instead of super, rergresstion instead of regression etc.Technical issues with labs appear too often - cannot start the server or unavailable at all for multiple days, broken conda installation due to outdated or incompatible module versions (in particular, torchvision and pillow).I was expecting much more accuracy from a course led by IBM.

The 2 labs can be combined into a single notebook. The 2 quizzes can be combined into 1 quiz of maybe 5 or more questions.
