1427998~COURSE!~buqL0cU7EeyptA5gfrY35Q,1672612912301,4,0,"The lectures are well presented, they explain internals behind things I code with C. Unfortunately the course material takes for granted your experience in understanding many technical aspects which aren't easy to understand if you never used assembly before. There are so many things covered here, these things are still black magic no matter how hard i try to understand them. The course lacks some basic examples or coding exercises you could do on your own to follow along with the course material, gradually building your skills and confidence.",0,0,Ernest Warzocha,1427998
