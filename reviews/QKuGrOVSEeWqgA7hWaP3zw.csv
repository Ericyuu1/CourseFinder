Stimulating and thoughtful with lots of ideas that I found relevant to my own experiences in the UK and Hong Kong. As a retired Geography Teacher, with a particular interest in the historical geography of rural settlement, I joined the course out of an almost casual interest in how the geography and sociology of urban settlement has developed over the last decade. I am now 'hooked' on the idea of a 'globalising urban world' and am reading 'on' and around the subject with renewed interest and making plans to visit some of the cities mentioned in the course.Thank you for opening up this fascinating insight into the world of the 21st century.
