25516397~COURSE!~KiBHguBOEemNmw4gGersHg,1638244839795,2,0,"It emphasizes programming and the fundamentals behind machine translation, not machine translation  itself (which was my focus or desire of study). Therefore, it is more oriented towards programming than translation or machine translation post editing itself.",0,4,Bruna Bonatto,25516397
32889430~COURSE!~KiBHguBOEemNmw4gGersHg,1613430901815,2,0,Good content but assignments slightly too easy and pleeease improve the English skills or use German instead and place subtitles. Thank you!,0,1,Mohamed Boudan,32889430
73350162~COURSE!~KiBHguBOEemNmw4gGersHg,1605277735488,2,0,"Kurs eher an Programmierer als Übersetzer orientiert. Die Erklärungen waren ziemlich komplex und erforderten meiner Meinung nach gründlichere IT- bzw. Softwareprogrammierungskenntnisse. Wenn der Dozent auf Englisch spricht, sollte seine Aussprache auch verständlicher sein oder zumindest sollten die Untertiteln nicht automatisiert, sondern richtig korrigiert sein.",0,6,Paula Barrientos Miguel,73350162

I passed all the time to figure out what the text would have to mean (e.g. ""source text"" became ""sewer text"").",0,1,Cristina Gadaleta,73779032
80103541~COURSE!~KiBHguBOEemNmw4gGersHg,1616243120033,4,0,"This course gives a good overview on the topic with good ressources and references for further reading. The only thing, which could be improved in my opinion is a more engaging way of presenting the lectures, but this is complaining at a high level. ",0,2,Bernadeta Chisarau,80103541
77414134~COURSE!~KiBHguBOEemNmw4gGersHg,1608657463672,4,0,"This course is not easy to follow. The additional readings are typically scientific papers on the topic, which is not helpful. How about a beginner's course on the topic?",0,8,Tomasz Muehleisen,77414134
12994796~COURSE!~KiBHguBOEemNmw4gGersHg,1607796521445,4,0,The 6th and 7th week are difficult the follow- too much theory and not enough practicals and very few examples. Week 1-4 is really good.

76095723~COURSE!~KiBHguBOEemNmw4gGersHg,1606082474409,4,0,"Course is very nice as an overview of the state of research in this area. Lot's of links to scientific papers, but no project included. I would love to work on implementations of some techniques mentioned there. Probably would continue with some TensorFlow tutorial.",0,4,Taras Bunyk,76095723

It is a very good course if one wants to get a broad understanding of machine translation. The tutor creates his own graphical representations that clearly convey the idea behind each concept, which I have never seen used in somewhere else, and they work extremely well.The tutor pronounces certain English words differently, but I get used to it quickly, and it doesn't bother me since.",0,1,Joe Hsiao,299152
