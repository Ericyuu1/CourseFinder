3713636~COURSE!~KRRDpBa-EeaXaw7Yj6TwHQ,1520426167687,2,0,"I have completed more than a few courses on Coursera and I can assure you that this course has the poorest production I have ever seen.All instructors read their scripts in a very boring, sloppy and incoherent style. The amount of effort you need to put in just to understand the lecturers is astounding.Several questions (end of videos and exams) seemed completely irrelevant and some were written very poorly.The exams added NO extra value to the course, all questions were copied from the videos. This is unfortunate because the exams could be a powerful tool to challenge students to use the knowledge they have just acquired.Video editing was very sloppy at times. At points it seems as if the editor had a stroke.And the worst part, I could've guessed more than half of the course material just with my very basic understanding of biology. Don't make a 3 week course if that is far less time than needed. The course basically gives you many general concepts without delving an inch deeper.In my opinion it is ridiculous that you have to pay in order to get a grade on a course as bad as this. I probably won't do a John Hopkins course on Coursera anytime soon.",0,8,Dekel Wainer,3713636

The pictures and data helped me to understand, but the language needs to be tweaked to make it easier to latch onto understanding, such as ""the cancer is essentially 'playing dead' when it goes past immune checkpoints"" or something like that. If that's how it's meant to be understood, that is. I realize cancer is a fairly weighty topic, but the way you teach it doesn't have to be, it should be easy to remember with memorable imagery.
