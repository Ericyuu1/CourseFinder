3107969~COURSE!~00A5f3pyEeWUswr9_O_RKw,1537790572431,2,0,"Ok, what I really like about this course are the instructors and how they approach the topic. You learn everything from preparing to doing the actual interviews including challenging topics like negotiating the salary. I normally would rate this course with 5 stars but what extremely annoys me are the assignments. Quizes are hard and so are the recordings you have to prepare. This would be OK if passing the assignment would not be associated with playing the lottery. You need 16 out of 20 points (5 questions with 4 points max) to pass an assignment. Getting 4 points is really hard since you have to perfectly fullfill the respective evaulation criteria (e.g. do a 5 minute talk --> Was the talk perfectly effective? Speaker perfectly enthusiastic? etc.). Doing so is nearly impossible for the average student because nearly nobody is a perfect speaker. Before knowing how hard it is to pass I rated many other students with 3 points per question, not knowing that they would fail. And under normal circumstances I would have given them 2 points because the evaluation criteria are really hard to accomplish, if you are honest. Moreover, often you only have one reviewer and deadlines can't be met because nobody or only one person review your assignment. Submissions are also often lacking, so you can't evaluate them, which is necessary to pass the course. In the end, I like the content of this course but I feel that it's much too difficult and random to pass assignments. Of all the 10 courses I did on Coursera this one was the hardest to pass and I'm about to quit it since you have to spend a lot of money when it takes so long to finish.",0,2,Manuel,3107969

If you fail the test you should have something leading you back to study sections so you can reivew the material that you fail.  I in my group was not the only one to feel this course lacked all the correct information to get 100% on all the test.  I'm glad this one is done and in the books. ,0,2,Marilyn Lacey ,48706353

6191907~COURSE!~00A5f3pyEeWUswr9_O_RKw,1459405738898,5,0," This course should be taken by anyone involved in the processs of applying for job interviews! It's both useful and pleasant to take. I work for a big company, in France, in the field of ""science & technology R&D"", and my lab recently opened a position for which we started interviewing applicants a few weeks ago. As a member of the team the position is opened to work with, I've been involved in the interview process. I was just amazed to see how unprepared the applicants were : they made mistake after mistake. Since we also have trainees and Ph.D students in the lab, who'll soon have to search for their first job, I had a look at the MOOC offer in the field of ""preparing for job interviews"", in order to see what advice I could provide for them to get prepared for this key step in building their career. I registered to this MOOC, as an auditor, and started browsing through their videos and accompanying documents. I just got caught in right away, despite the fact that I couldn't participate (neither submit nor evaluate) in assignments: one needs to be pay for that, and I had no real interest in doing so, for now, although I truly think it's worth the cost if one is in the position of preparing for job interviews. I realised that, if the job applicants we interviewed in my lab had taken this remarkable course prior to their interviews, this would have saved them so many basic mistakes. If you never had the opportunity to reflect on what a job interview process is, and are applying for interviews, just give it a try: I bet you'll benefit from this experience a lot... and it might simply change your life! This course is the second of a series of 5 from a specialization. I already audited the first 2 courses, and I'm just eager to see the next two come on stage (the last is a capstone project I'll skip for now.)  ",0,1,Maxime Zabiégo,6191907
