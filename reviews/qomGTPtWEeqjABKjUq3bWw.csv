100376627~COURSE!~qomGTPtWEeqjABKjUq3bWw,1646335125829,1,0,"Instructor promises that we will get a link to download the data and script. Link to course material does not work as expected. Takes you to a place where the free storage for the files has expired. The only way to get the files is by enrolling in a PAID SUBSCRIPTION. This issue was reported in the course user forum a month ago. No response by anybodo so far. Best for students who have taken some trainnig in R and the RStudio environment. If you don't know much about either and then try his techniques, you may get very frustrated. And again, can't do it on your own once you leave the course, unless you want to pay a subscription to some hosting company. ",0,0,Harlan Black,100376627
