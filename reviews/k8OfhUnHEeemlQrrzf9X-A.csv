Partly irrelevant, partly totally repetitive (if the lecturer says 50 ""again"" in a few videos, he knows himself that he is just repeating the same thing again and again), mostly vague and high-level and partly just wrong (especially when it comes to brand strategy). Expected more from IE Business School",0,2,Nils,56085563

The reason I gave this a 4-star is because of the redundant assignments, like their other courses on this specialization. Maybe it would be better if they could just move those last ""capstone"" exercises to a separate course, since the capstone assignments, especially for this one, are only repeating the same tasks from the weeks before, and maybe not all students also wish to push through with a capstone.",0,0,Jenalyn Lopez,75194994

44699948~COURSE!~k8OfhUnHEeemlQrrzf9X-A,1585655409036,5,0,The course has the word BRAND in it but underneath the covers it gives you the taste of what creative advertising is about. In my searches on the internet you will not be able to find a hands on course like this that hits the creative artistry meets business which is what creative advertising is about. The course itself is fun and easy to understand. The projects can be completed however in reviewing my peer's projects this subject is difficult to master. Some of my peers really put together some wonderful projects and they have that artistry and business acumen to do well on the project and also have real tools to take this into real world experiences.  Those peers were few and far between. Coursera is experiencing large issues on peer review projects and they have decided to do peer reviews because then they have scalability to enroll many students and have the projects graded at no cost.  The truth of the matter is that students enroll but few keep going to get to the point of handing in projects. The end result you have to go begging to get your project reviewed and its questionable that the reviewer is experienced enough to do a proper review. I rather have an expert give me low marks and be critical so I can really gauge on the skillset I have for this specific subject. Overall for the course I recommend it. It serves best for creatives who have real business acumen. A business person will be drowning a bit on the creative side and an artist will need to have some business savvy to put together a good project. Overall an outstanding course!,0,3,Verghese Thanjan,44699948
