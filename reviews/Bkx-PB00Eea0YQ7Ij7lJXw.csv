But the quality of this course on text mining is far below the average level of the first three. Go find some other courses if you want to learn text mining with Python. There are too many areas of flaws in this course. I am only highlighting the top 5 below: 1. lacks good connection throughout the course content. This problem exists almost everywhere, both from slide to slide within a video and from video to video. Many times you would have questions in your head like “why is he talking about this?” or “what is this?”2. use example just for the purpose of showing examples. Don’t really explain the point it is supposed to explain. In many times the examples do not provide clarity, but raise more confusion instead. 3. assignment tasks either too simple, or remotely related to what is introduced in the course. The worst case is assignment in week 4, where the assignment is so poorly constructed. You have to spent days to figure out the right answer. They call it “debug”, but there is nothing wrong with my code. I would say it is more of a process to “try to figure out what the instructor is asking for”.  4. talks too much about the theoretical things, not very good introduction of using python. Even when python code is demonstrated, it is almost always in a very abstract way. This is significantly different from the first three courses, and very annoying. You would need to spend about the same amount of time googling how the packages work as I have never took the course. 5.

This is an issue with every module of this specialization but Text Mining has been spectacularily bad. You need to spend hours browsing the discussion group just to figure out what is expected. Mentors are doing a great job explaining in the forum, but there is no feedback loop - the instructions are never corrected. Sometimes you see a forum post about a misleading or simply wrong instruction, that is dated 6 months ago, and the instruction still hasn't been corrected. It's like no-one cares. I feel like 70% of the time I spent on this course wasn't learning Text Mining, it was dealing with ambiguous instructions or autograder issues.",0,8,Emil Krause,7349483

IMO, the lectures were at much too high a level while the programming assignments were very detailed with vague instructions and little guidance.  There was no link between what was discussed in class and how the fine details of the assignments were to be understood.  In addition, the course was published with errors in the auto-grader and no resources in the Resources link (not even slide decks from the lectures, so to review material you were forced to re-visit all the recorded lectures which was very inefficient).   My recommendation to Coursera and the Univ of Michigan is to completely re-do the course, doubling the number of lectures to provide not just the broad overview of the topics, but also some detailed descriptions of recommended ways to implement what was discussed.   I would also recommend using Professor Andrew Ngs Machine Learning course as a guide for how to create great programming assignments, with detailed PDFs (typically 5-6 pages) describing what is to be done AND WHY (linking back to the lectures) and ""telling a story"" that is cohesive and leads the student to create something end-to-end (in small steps) that does something amazing by the end.  The programming assignments in this course seemed, in contrast, to be a shotgun blast of ""do this"", ""create this"", ""make this happen"" with little context of how the small pieces fit together or what the overall goal of the assignment is to accomplish -- and at the end, a feeling of ""I passed the autograder's expections, but have no idea what I've really done or why"".

The assignments for the first three weeks were great in quality, and even though I had to spend some time on some 'unnecessary debugging ' due to their Autotrader every time I submitted my assignments, it actually was not that difficult to figure out. So I think it's still worth it. I gave four stars because I feel the final weeks' content was way too general. The videos in the fourth week only gave an overview of the subject from a very high level, provided no coding examples with real-life data. I feel there was a big gap between what was taught in the lectures and what was required in the assignment of that week. Also, the wording of the last assignment was very unclear. I would recommend this course to others because the first three weeks' content was great and you could learn a ton from the first three weeks' assignments especially.   ",0,0,Gina Guan,27878220

The reason why I took 1 star back is that the instructor seems to be not very well prepared for this course. First, he used 'so' too frequently while lecturing. I am not saying that he should totally not use any filler words (like 'hmm' or 'um', and 'so' is one of them), but saying that using many fillers could cause distraction and confusion. As 'so' is one of the transition words, it implies a logical connection between 2 sentences. Using 'so' a lot was actually distracting me from following the course material because I had to identify which 'so' was a filler so that I could ignore it and which 'so' was a consequence indicator so that I could pay attention to the following sentence. Second, he sometimes seemed to get lost with the slides. For example, from Week 3 Video ""Learning Text Classifiers in Python"" slide at 13:36, the slide was easy to understand by showing the codes saying ""NLTK.classify has something called SklearnClassifier which could let you use some models from scikit-learn such as naive_bayes or svm and here are 2 examples"", but his way of explaining the slide was quite confusing.

It was an order of magnitude times better than the previous course, 'Applied Machine Learning,' by Kevyn Collins-Thompson. Professor V. G. Vinod Vydiswaran started most lectures with a purpose and an alluring example. He spent a good amount of time building intuition behind the algorithms and techniques involved, and saved most of the coding for challenging and satisfying homework assignments--all qualities that the previous course did not have. Finally, professor V. G. Vinod Vydiswaran was simply energetic about teaching. I didn't have to change playrate to > 1.2x. I genuinely enjoyed his teaching style. This course has restored my faith in the 'Applied Data Science with Python' specialization by University of Michigan and I am confident in my ability solve text classification problems in Python.
