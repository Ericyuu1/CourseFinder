There was an entire section of code and video which the instructor seems to have missed altogether.The instructor seems to just copy the spec_augment library from some GitHub repository without showing which package to install. Overall I would say this was very poorly executed.Very little discussion was spent into why spec-augment was used at all? Even a signle statement saying that the masking improves the Robustness of the Acoustic model (without the LM) on datasets such as Librispeech without any noise aware training shows good results would have sufficed. ,0,0,Agrover112,35597372
