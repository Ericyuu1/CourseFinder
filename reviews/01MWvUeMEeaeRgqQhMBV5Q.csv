The first 3 weeks are great and I found it very useful. After that the lecturer goes quite quickly through certain models and calculations, with the main issue being he interchanges multiple terms continuously without properly explaining what each term is. I found myself constantly stopping the video, rewinding, scrolling down to the transcript to try and understand the flow of the lecture, which at times appeared all over the place. Many of the calculations in the quizzes are not accurate. I found no matter how many times I did the calculations that I was often a few decimal places off what the answers were and often picked the answer closest to my calculation. Often this resulted in the correct answer, but to provide us with numbers without decimal places and then to give the answers with decimals (clearly using decimal places to work the answers out), meant that the answers we calculate were often quite distant from the correct one.

Since there is no other lecture material it is difficult to understand. Especially if English is your second or third language it might cause some extra frustration since finance is a whole new language in itself. Many times the calculations just don't seem to add up.

I was working on questions for Week 4 and couldn't figure a few out so I took them to someone in my Finance dept who also couldn't figure out how certain values were being arrived at. We worked backwards from other answers and still couldn't determine how values were being calculated. I submitted my issues to the Forum and received zero response; I had no choice but to proceed. Same thing occurred during Week 5. I eventually got in touch with Coursera support who advised that the teachers are not required to respond to any questions (and I saw that the teacher had been in the Forum), but rather the ""community"" would respond. I pointed out that there are a few flaws in that thought process, and now that I'm well past those weeks there are zero responses in the Forum. They created a help ticket but I never got a response.There are several points where the teacher is working on a spreadsheet but you can't see what he's seeing so it's hard to follow, and many times when you can see his screen it is too small / not focused.I'm not saying I didn't learn because I did; I took copious notes and ended up creating my own spreadsheet for many items which will be useful.
