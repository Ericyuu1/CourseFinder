1689750~COURSE!~frvQnkLfEeusyQ4n_00ahw,1676243739661,1,0,"The Course  title and description is misleading. The course covers topics like conductors and insullators and wires and router hardware. It has nothing to do with the actual IoT de[ployment or interaction with any of the popular cloud infrastructure like AWS or Azure. Further, the whole specialization covers very little of Arduino. In short, fell flat as far as expectations go.",0,0,Alok Jain,1689750

The only thing that I would change is that the practical assignments are not related with the Cloud implementations of the IoT applications. There are many Cloud technologies provided by different vendors such as AWS, Azure, etc, that could be added as part of the practical part instead of orientate it to Machine Learning. Other than that I loved the course.",0,0,Gonzalo F C,24886973
