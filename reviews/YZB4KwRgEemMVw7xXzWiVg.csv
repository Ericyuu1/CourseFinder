53193789~COURSE!~YZB4KwRgEemMVw7xXzWiVg,1586652303361,2,0,"The course is a very good entry point for understanding a mess US gun laws are thanks to both pro- and anti-gun activities. Some of the topics are covered quite well, with a lot of data and sources.Unfortunately, that's it on a positive side.The course takes a neutral to extreme anti-gun position and plays very safe. The very idea of using evidence-based politics is great, but not a single example of an evidence-based failure of any of current gun regulations is suspicious at best. For example, a lot of material is revolving around Maryland, but when talking about National Integrated Ballistic Information Network, you will not hear a word why Maryland has closed its IBIS or New York - its CoBIS (both were parts of NIBIS).Worse yet, some positions taken during the course are denying each other. In Week 2 Prof. Jon Vernik is absolutely happy about an assault weapon ban (which doesn't completely ban large capacity magazines - remember it) in Maryland while talking with Attorney General Brian Frosh. In Week 3 Prof. Jeff Swanson says that 17% of violent crime inmates having serious mental illnesses doesn't mean SMI are affecting violent behavior (despite only 4,5% of US population having SMI overall, according to NIMH, not mentioned in the course) - having quite a time to discuss how much Mr. Trump is wrong saying ""mental illness is an issue"" about one of recent mass shootings. And then in Week 5 you're presented with a list of mass shootings that were a reason to ban ""assault weapons"" in some states. It's not mentioned, but if you check any of those events, you'll find a mentally ill person almost every time, sometimes with years after years of problems well known for people around and doctors. In case of Nikolas Jacob Cruz, for example, we talk about five years and at least two suggestions to submit him to involuntary treatment before the actual shooting. And finally Feb 2020 JHBPSH report (not in this course) uses exactly one sentence in a whole wall of text - ""In addition, the study did not find an independent association between assault weapon bans and the incidence of fatal mass shootings after controlling for the effects of bans on large-capacity magazines."" To put it short - no evidence that a Maryland assault weapon ban is of any use, and SMI looks to be an issue at least in case of mass shootings, despite Prof. Swanson position.Overall this program is not bad but is very one-sided and has to be taken with a grain of salt. It mostly presents topics of rare disagreement and carefully avoids any possible gun regulation failures.",0,6,Illia Kondratov,53193789

Still, especially if the course is intended for high-school students who are not (yet) scientists trained in critiquing studies, I fear this course has left them unable to evaluate papers by any metric other than ""I like/dislike its conclusions.""That criticism would be unimportant in a course that acknowledges that there are two sides to both an undecided scientific question and a hotly disputed political subject, and so discusses both.  Unfortunately, only one side has been well presented.  I think that harms the understanding of both the law and the science, and erects obstacles to discussion between persons with different opinions.In contrast, I have only great praise for Dr. Crifasi's presentation on safe storage in practice; Professor Meares' presentation on police-involved shootings; and the Week 6 materials on ""Cure Violence"", on cooperative efforts around promoting safe storage and suicide risk recognition/suicide prevention, and on place-based, community-led ""healthy neighborhood"" interventions--all OUTSTANDING!",0,12,"Ippolit Matjucha, MD",41657799

I received a lot of surprising information about how much overall (not everything) gun owners and non gun owners agree on policy. Thank you guys for an easy to use course on the education of gun violence! This is an ever-growing issue in this country.,0,0,Lily Cohen,41934261
41665591~COURSE!~YZB4KwRgEemMVw7xXzWiVg,1559787044112,5,0,Look fwd to updates on this course if possible to augment our knowledge. Perhaps a residential seminar annually & follow up courses as new research comes in and can be applied. We are beginning to define the narrative with evidence based and evidence informed data which we can use practice. Stories as to the train cost of gun violence and the efforts to stem from it need to be told.,0,2,Douglas MacLeod,41665591

Then I suggest anyone taking this course settle into a comfortable chair in a peaceful room each time you tackle a week's content. This is not light breezy material and deserves your clear attention. The amount of concrete data on way to SOLVE gun violence is uplifting and promising. It's implementation becomes another issue, but second to the purpose of this course.",0,2,Dana Zurzolo,41983586

The pacing was excellent, and the fact that the studies in question were listed on the slides and included in the available readings was a great help.",0,0,John Lestrange,41688577
