37563833~COURSE!~dB5r2uTgEeubuw5vhJdWSw,1646155268721,5,0,"This is a brief but excellent introduction or refresher (depends on your exisitng level of knowlegde) to JavaScript security, Web browser security, Node.js security, and web site authentication. The Instructor is obviously incredibly knowledgable but he describes concepts at an elementary level which is easy to understand. I did have to replay a few segments of video but I think that was a reflection of my lack of prior knowledge rather than poor explanations by the Instructor. I learned much more in this brief course than i expected to I consider it time very well spent. ",0,0,Gary Crosby,37563833
