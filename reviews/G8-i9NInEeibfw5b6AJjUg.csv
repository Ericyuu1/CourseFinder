Is there a cause effect relationship here or is it really just co-incidence?

14820168~COURSE!~G8-i9NInEeibfw5b6AJjUg,1561368243651,5,0,"This course really shows the multidisciplinary field that Astrobiology is in a clear way. It's an interesting mix between introducing many subjects while at various moments diving into the material a little bit more.The biggest plus for me on this course was the fact that the course gives rather concise info per subject per week, but through the peer-reviewed writing assignments you really have to the think beyond the material and tie things together yourself.Also, Prof Impey is one of my favorite online teachers (I've tried about 20 MOOCs and actually finished 15 of them in the past five years, so I've seen a variety of online teachers ;)) I hugely appreciate the fact that when you are enrolled in one of his two courses, you can participate in live Q&A sessions about astronomy once every few weeks.",0,5,Hester van Breederode,14820168

Some jokes are very refreshful during the lections and the lections itself are neat and clear. Thanks to (tech.) help also. That's very important too.Quizes and other works are better than in Astrophysics course  (at least when I took it) but there is still missing attachments before the lectures (like slides or reading list, e.g.), but i believe it will be corrected sooner or later!I highly recommend this course. Especially for amateurs/begginers.Thank you!",0,2,Maya,28844934

Prof. Impey clearly explains the subjects but also makes it entertaining.He talks in depth about many subjects that I have trouble finding anywhere else.After taking his last course astronomy: exploring time and space, I was so excited when he came out with this course and I was not disappointed!

5312211~COURSE!~G8-i9NInEeibfw5b6AJjUg,1558989631171,5,0,"This Astrobiology course is not the first course I have taken about Astronomy. I took ""Astronomy - Exploring Time and Space"" some years ago, and found it fascinating, very well structured and interactive. Since then, I have been following, as often as I can, Professor Impey's Q&A sessions LIVE or else on YouTube replay. So when I learned there was to be this course on Astrobiology also by him and the University of Arizona, I immediately signed on as soon as it became available. I had taken a previous course on Astrobiology, an Introduction to the theme, by the University of Edinburgh. That was several years ago. Astronomy has always been my hobby, ever since I was taught by an old ship's doctor, on a trip across the Atlantic, how to identify Orion in the sky. He had the adorable German way of pronouncing Betelgeuse (he had been a ship's doctor in the Kriegsmarine in the war). He said it as ""Bay-tell-goyze"". (Well, that's certainly better than those who say it ""beetleJuice!)I have been keeping up with the so many new developments there have been in the past forty years or so, and the discoveries on Europa, Enceladus and Titan have absolutely blown me over. This Astrobiology course was perfect to learn all the methodology for searching for life elsewhere than on earth, and beyond the old ""Goldilocks Zone"". The lectures were all excellent, and the two assignments towards the end of the course were challenging and really cemented the knowledge learned. I certainly recommend this course to all and any who are interested in Astronomy. It is a course for beginners but also very much for those who already have some knowledge about the issues, but who want to have them restructured with the latest developments, and in a professional way, as Professor Impey does so well!Thank you to all who put this course together, and thank you to the mentors who sent me interesting comments and feedback on my responses.",0,5,Hernan Reyes,5312211
