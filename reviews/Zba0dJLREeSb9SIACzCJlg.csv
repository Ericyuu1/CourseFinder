2702104~COURSE!~Zba0dJLREeSb9SIACzCJlg,1440223114772,1,0,"A rather non-engaged teacher ho does not know what goes on with the reviews.  She does not have enough people to review the written assignment and the assignments go UN-reviewed leading to a 'no-grade' whihc is ridiculous.  It is not even clear how the written reviews are graded. She is not involved and does not serve to inspect the work of the students to ascertain that a grade is in order.  Three reviews are requited for a grade, but she has so few reviewers that one might only get one review and then fail.  Very inept. Stay away from this one. She does not get involved with answering questions of students either. Her internet activity is rated a 2/5 whihc I did not know until I got involved with this course. Observation of the video showing her teaching is terrible. She places herself in front of the camera and one cannot see the placement of the student's fingers or most importantly what is actually happening on the fret board with the finger movement. She also places herself directly in front of the camera blocking a clear view of everything - poor video skills. ",0,1,DanielSubach,2702104

The reason it gets 4 instead of 5 stars is because, when I took the course, there was some trouble getting timely feedback from the peer graders (and delayed feedback will negatively affect your grade). Also, this is a tiny thing, but the Vivaldi music at the beginning and end of every single video got old really quickly, especially since there's a mistake in the recording.",0,0,Robyn James,2841690

94149554~COURSE!~Zba0dJLREeSb9SIACzCJlg,1636735378013,5,0,I loved the course content. I am principally a pianist and piano teacher but have been doing some early- level violin teaching with some piano students and wanted to ensure I am doing it properly. Stacia and her colleagues are very technically astute and know how to train students in a way which prevents technical problems from the outset. The tutors are upbeat and well organized and I believe this confidence is infectious to anyone who teaches anything. I am utilizing many of the ideas in this in my own violin practice and have found that my set up and tone is already more stable. ,0,0,Gabrielle Francesca Peacock,94149554
