26323667~COURSE!~A9OckSDZEeWXzxJxfIL00w,1547313628286,4,0,"Overall I enjoyed this course very much. Excellent choice of readings. The irony in this course in that Peter who has a slower paced presentation is very understandable compared to  Murray whose presentation is much more dynamic but extremely repetitive. Everything Peter said was clear and logical. I had difficulty with what Murray was trying to say when he interpreted the literature. For example, he talked about how eroticism was related to violence but the only example he gave was a boy trying to impress a girl by fighting. He did not relate how eroticism and violence co-existed with the Nazis. He talked how people react when they are victims of violence but only related it to the boy pulling off the wings of a fly. He did not discuss how the Jewish people related to the violence. Did they take their suffering out on fellow Jews? I found it difficult to understand what he was trying to say. He talked in circles on the first ""This Way to the Gas"" lecture. He could have cut that lecture to one sentence: ""Borowoski was not writing about himself when he wrote in the first person."" He never explains why people would get pleasure from reading about the Holocaust. I listened carefully to everyone of his sentences and thought them basically repeating the same idea over and over in a different way. He talks in circles. The best part was when he read from the book. He talked in circles about shoes. Just say shoes were necessary for survival. It's like he's talking off the top of his head without doing any prep work.

Step by step we understood the events unfolding in Eastern Europe- Poland, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Russia. At the same time there was detailed analysis of events unfolding in Belgium, Holland, Denmark and France. The detailed discussions about the literature on Holocaust is a BIG bonus.

25565446~COURSE!~A9OckSDZEeWXzxJxfIL00w,1511925206090,5,0,"I found this course very informative and followed a logical pattern. I knew a lot of the history of the Holocaust but never really thought of it the way the Professors present it and get us to explore the whys and hows. All the true facts are there and can't be denied even though there are those who live with the denial. To explore the Holocaust through witnesses, survivors, etc puts a whole new perspective on things. To understand Nazi Ideology and all it's lunacy was a true eye opener as I've dealt with more of the battles and always thought of the Holocaust as it happened and that was that. I thoroughly enjoyed this course and hope to find more or similar ones in the near future.      Just as a note, recently found out my ancestry probably goes back to the Ukraine, Jewish and family name of Lipsitz as in the lesson. Raised Roman Catholic but the family knew there were secrets which our father for some reason never divulged before his death in 1990, nor did our mother say anything even up to her demise in 2014. Interesting and now my personal investigation continues for the truth and the whys and hows also.      Thanks for an enjoyable time and take care.",0,3,David Hearst,25565446

The 2 professors who present the material are both experts in their respective areas: Holocaust history and Comparative Literature. They present the material not only from a profound academic understanding, they are both children of the Holocaust. And so they convey the material in a deeply personal and human way as well. Using the Holocaust as a momentous backdrop, the professors challenge the students to examine important philosophical questions throughout the course. The books and movies discussed are absolutely wonderful.
