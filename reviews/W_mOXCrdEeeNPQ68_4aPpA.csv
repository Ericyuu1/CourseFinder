Andrew Ng talked about the same matrix multiplication and derivation processes over and over again and how important they are, while at the same time reassuring students that it wasn't a big deal if they didn't know calculus which I strongly disagree... If anyone wants to learn deep learning they should at least understand _the basics_ of calculus, linear algebra, probability and statistics.

What is the purpose of writing on the screen if you can use animations to more clearly connect concepts during your lessons?2- I don't expect that errors to be just rectified before the video. Reupload the video? Errors like that during long formulas and explanations are just going to kill the learning. It is pointless to write before the video that in the future video you will make an error. Just correct it ON the video.3- If you can't explain in-depth calculus, just to di with the help of someone else. You cannot exclude calculus.4- The only thing i've learned in this course is vectorization (thank you). The rest is just copy the formula given during the explanation (handwritten on the screen.....) and paste during the exam. I didn't learn how to apply a neural network because during the ""exams"" it was built already. I expected assignments to make me build an create every piece of the network, instead it was all already done and all i had to do was repeat what Andrew says in the video. This is NOT learning.

So you learn that a^[l](i) is the activation vector for layer ""l"" and example ""i"" but then you get to the python portion and, big surprise, none of that information is even slightly useful.Even worse, the course hasn't chosen its audience.

Most tasks in them are on the level of “copy and paste this piece of code”, “retrieve a value from a python dictionary” or “use a mathematical formula displayed directly above”. I appreciate the effort to make the course more inclusive to people with a weaker background in Computer Science. It would however make the course much more worthwhile to have challenging exercises with optional hints, instead of giving the solution away in each task description.“Neural Networks and Deep Learning” hardly teaches anything, that wasn’t already covered my “Machine learning”. The major differences is that it uses Python instead of Octave and arranges features as rows instead of columns. In my eyes, the learners time is better spent, skipping the first course of the Deep Learning specialization entirely and taking the Machine Learning Course instead. To the creators / maintainers of the course I would advise creating a summary, that covers the most fundamental differences between the two courses (different notation, numpy fundamentals) and make a suggestion where someone who has taken Machine Learning should join the Deep Learning specialization.

I know the goal is to just white box everything, but please, some object oriented programming is desperately needed. For example just stuffing all the caches into a giant list makes debugging a nightmare (what is what? which ones came from activation function?). With all the focus on notation, it really breaks down in the code and makes it hard to follow.  I really like the way IBM did this and taught how to do it ""wrong"" and do it programmatically before actually implementing vectorization to speed things up.

As many people have pointed out, most of the interesting material related to deep learning is already covered in Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course. Before embarking in this specialisation, one should be aware of the following:1-The underlying theory is extremely simple: NN's secret sauce is gradient descent. The fancy terms (RNNs, CNNs, etc) are just variations around the basic Neural Network. 2-The assignments are extremely basic. Very often this a case of filling a few blanks there and there in pre-written python functions. The only difficulty is to remember the various APIs for Tensorflow and Keras (eg: ""should I write activation='relu' or 'Relu' or 'RelU' as a parameter for my Keras black-box ?""). Far from designing an ""intelligent"" machine, I felt that I was the one being reduced to a box-checking automaton. 3-You will pay per month that you spend working through the specialisation. Sorry, busy people. This might seem anecdotal but it changes the learning dynamic entirely, by discouraging time-consuming exploration of the research articles mentioned in the videos, as well as self-derivation of results that are not demonstrated. The clock is ticking. Therefore the implicitly encouraged behaviour is to ignore interesting/optional material and keep filling the blanks in python functions. This review should acknowledge the work of prof. Ng and his team. There are many positive things about the courses that have been mentioned elsewhere.

26867115~COURSE!~W_mOXCrdEeeNPQ68_4aPpA,1505736078659,2,0,"AI is the place to be, no denying that. And I am here to learn.But I am having several problems with this course.First, I am trying to get into the forum. After 30 minutes of searching the site, I have made no progress in any mention of the forums or any clue how to get there. What am I missing?The second issue is that Andrew Ng could, I believe, inject more ""intuition"" into the introductory concepts in neural network learning. To be specific, I believe he should explain that connection  values to and from the hidden nodes change by an error feedback signal which originates from the difference between the net output as it learns, and the correct output as specified in the training set. Thus a picture shows a cat. The pixel vector is presented to the net with the desired output, ""Cat =1."" But the untrained net outputs .15, a number indication ""no cat"" by its low value. So an error signal gets fed back into the net, which learns Make this crystal clear at first.Here is a suggested intro for Andrew:Quote:""A simple way to convey this feedback learning is via an analogy to how humans learn by a fundamentally identical  process.  Many simple examples could be given. A person learning pilot a boat steers the boat too far to the right, so it heads to the dock. Noticing this, the learner turns the rudder in the opposite direction to correct, and the boat gets on the correct path again. After some learning, the student pilot gets a more ""deft"" feel for steering the boat. The errors (hopefully) become less, as the learned control is achieved. Thus, feedback learning is the most natural of human endeavors, and is a major part of what makes humans so successful compared to species with less of this ability. ""Feedback"" was popularized by Norbert Wiener of MIT ca. 1949, who called it ""cybernetics."" Cybernetics is named after the Greek word for ""rudder of a ship."" The fundamental idea is we learn by negative feedback, and machines can too.It is called ""negative feedback"" because the feedback signal is just the opposite of the error at the output of the net, person, boat rudder, etc. If the net output is too high, then the feedback says ""go low."" If the net output is too low, the feedback signal says ""higher.""  In a similar way, we learn from our errors and mistakes in this course,  as much at first by our correct answers. So I encourage you to be diligent and learn this new area of expertise, deep learning technology. Don't be discouraged by the unfamiliarity of the material or your incorrect answers. They are valuable feedback for succeeding in this course!  I wish you that learning success as you join this area of the future as it grows! ""So in conclusion, I suggest hitting the ""feedback"" issue a bit harder in the intro to this great course. Respectfully,John Brookes",0,0,john brookes,26867115
10745980~COURSE!~W_mOXCrdEeeNPQ68_4aPpA,1503226872482,2,0,"The course expands on the neural network portion of Andrew Ng's original Machine Learning course, but ported over to Python. Even though it is spread out over 4 weeks, it really doesn't cover any additional material. Instead, Ng repetitively goes over the math and coding with vectors in Python, while stressing how hard the calculus derivation would be. This might all be helpful to you if calculus was not your strong suit, but my guess is that if you have any kind of background in computer science or statistics, the math in this course would be almost elementary. The assignments are done on Python Jupyter notebooks, which has the advantage of a standard environment, but disadvantage in that it hides some abstractions. Specifically, you lose the sense of what the actual code would look like in a Python IDE. Sure, you can download the notebooks as .py files. Much of the code is pre-written, and you only fill in a few lines of code in each assignment. It would take a lot of self-study on what's actually going on in setting up the programs to actually be able to self-write a neural network. Although Python is without question more popular in machine learning than Octave, it is more popular because of its library support, and in a course that requires you to build your own neural network instead of using libraries (besides numpy), that doesn't matter. I preferred doing the assignments in Octave rather than the notebooks.Since it is impossible to purchase this course on its own, perhaps the bigger question is whether the specialization is worth it. Courses 4 and 5 are not up at the time of this review, but Course 3 is only 2 weeks with 2 quizzes and no programming assignments, and Course 2 is about hyperparameter tuning, arguably the most novel in the 3 courses, but still not something that deserves its own specialization or even its own course.

As for me, I can derive the missing steps by myself as I learned calculus and the linear algebra. But it still good to include the derivations for our convenience. It's not necessary to derive them in the lecture, but still we need some materials that document the derivations.  Second, Jupyter notebook is not a good choice for the course.

This structure of assignment forces the student to focus on matching the expected output instead of really understanding the concept.  I am pretty sure most students did not really grasp the concepts at an intellectual level but still passed with decent grades. This is exactly the problem with schools today and I hope that Coursera is working towards rectifying that. How do we create a learning platform that forces the student to intellectually interact with the problems? Many students that come here have picked up bad habits from their previous learning careers.

Programming assignments were almost like fill in the blanks. They don't give you much room to play around and learn more. Rather they have strict requirements.

Someone with a good understanding of sound production should be able to fix this easily with the help of an equalizer though.The other complaint I have is that there are sometimes text disclaimers before a video, that at a certain timestamp an equation or a spoken sentence is incorrect.

Andrew Ng is ranked #3 in the field of Deep Learning, in terms of the number of citations, on Google Scholar. Therefore, being able to learn from a person like him is an extremely valuable chance. I learned a lot, but would like to tell the things that should be improved:• There are lots of redundant repetition. It kills the flow and creates a serious mess• Assignments are only focused on finding a few missing lines in the cells. Therefore, it cannot evaluate whether you ""understand the big picture"" and ""can build a model on your own"" or not• Sometimes terms/concepts are not clearly explained OR not explained at the right time. Example: A new term ""activations"" comes up in a video, and you wonder what is that. However, you learn what actually it is, maybe in the next video by your own inferenceAdvice for learners: Before starting to a programming assignment, download the whole folder of this programming assignment (you cannot download a folder, but you can download it file by file and create the same folder with its original structure) and work on your computer. By this way, you can prevent the ""kernel disconnection"" risk of the online version, and also replace the notes within the ""Markdown"" cells with your own summary.

I am used to write a code on an empty sheet, designing the code structure, classes etc. Here most of the work was already done and I was required only to put few lines of logic, having almost explcitely stated above the code what I should write.

Also, I miss the little questions inside each video (especially the ones that ask about ideas that are about to be explained and make you think a little more). They have been included in the test at the end of the week, which has now 10 questions instead of 5. I also miss the lectures after the videos, which helped with the hardest concepts. The whole Machine Learning course seemed more inspiring than this one. As a little detail, I preferred the sans-serif font in the Machine Learning course slides than the one used here. The other thing I don't like are the Jupyter notebooks. I get the point and they should be a good tool to code and learn and to evaluate the exercises, but I prefer the pdfs and the downloadable programming files. In the Machine Learning course you had a lot of structured Matlab/Octave files in your computer that you could then reuse easily. Here you have a document mixing text and code and it is not clear where all the code files are or how to download them for later use, Also, I like to program in my own environment, with my preferred text editor (with autocompletion, colors combinations, keyboard shortcuts...). Here you must use a basic online editor that also is hard to navigate through using the keyboard, because the text parts are also editable and selectable and you must jump from one part to another to move yourself through the document. And you need to do so, because your screen has a size and the explanations and other functions are long and they are far away from the code when you start programming. It's a very awkward way of working.The programming exercises are very guided and you must just fill little snippets of code, which is not hard to do. They must ""cheat"" you giving you half the info you need for a formula to make you think a little more or it would be too easy, but the whole structure of the program is done and, although everything is very detailed in the comments, the fact that you don't program all of it doesn't help you understand the key concepts explained in the slides.You must know some Python to be comfortable when coding, because there is no explicit material about the language syntax (in the Machine Learning course there was a video with a quick tour about Matlab/Octave and more optional short videos to learn the basics in less than one hour),Anyway, the course materials are great and updated, and the derivatives role in the learning process is here explained clearly (I didn't understand its importance in the other course).

Questions on the specific formulae notations in the quizzes are also a bit annoying (as one could use different notations, different orientation of the matrixes, so why should one have to commemorate the specific way it was done in the course)? While having a custom backprop implementation is certainly interesting, I'd rather use it as an extra-cirricular material.  The way it is - too much tech detail of the implementation in the assignments to go through, although only useful within the specific framework provided.

But you will be confronted with multiplying matrices and some differentiation. More than anything, I found it difficult to keep track of the different matrices, and particularly their dimensions, which if you do this course you will see is vital. There's also a lot of notation to overcome. You will need to understand some python, particularly how to extract values from tuples or dictionaries, and being familiar with user-defined functions will also help. So, easy?The course starts with a 0-level neural network and builds up to a deep neural network. It's a nice way to easy yourself into what is clearly a complicated subject. The downside (at least for me) was that each week I was hit by yet more new notation, and I felt that some of what I'd been taught in the previous week (and was clinging on to by my fingertips) was almost redundant. It made my head spin. Nonetheless, I persevered and passed the course.So, I've gained an appreciation of approximately how a neural network works. I could not build a neural network from scratch without massive recourse to my notes and assignments, and plenty of time. Is this how people build neural networks, or are they using libraries to make the job much easier (Tensorflow, Keras, etc.?) Or, can I use the final assignment as a template and apply this to many problems? I don't know.I thought the notes were quite poor. There is a mountain of writing on most slides at the end. I scribbled more notes to explain Andrew's notes, otherwise a week later it'll be clear as Aramaic. However, Andrew repeats and explains well what's happening. He has a calm and reassuring manner, which I really liked. People have complained about assignments being too easy. Not for me. I thought they were a good way to reinforce the lectures, and provided a means to see how a neural network could be built in practice.

Those who think it was ""too simple"", it might be the case that it was not the right level for them. Here are some of the things that worked really well. First, the assignments were well structured and built on each other. I really loved how scaffolded the notebooks were. Showing an estimate of approx. how many lines of code are needed is a great way to signal to the beginner in terms of how much work is needed. While the amount of code needed to write is small, you need to understand *why* you are writing it, and that takes mental effort. Second, can't say enough great things about the forums. People are responsive and helpful. I have had more help in this forum than at my formal educational institute where the TAs are not either trained to help or don't want to help or both. Here are some things I wish the course did betterFirst, I wish the connection to the larger picture was made through each exercise. One suggestion could be using modular blocks inside the notebooks to show the flow of data as you code. The flowcharts inside the notebooks can use a bit of work -- especially in matching them to the lecture slides.Second, I wish we had a single page where all the derivations and formulae are provided.

Many topics are explained clearly, with valuable field practitioners insight, and you are given quizzes and code-exercises that help deepen the understanding of how to implement the concepts in the videos. I would recommend to take them after the initial Andrew Ng ML course by Stanford, unless you have prior background in this topic.There are a few shortbacks:1 - the video editing is poor and sloppy. Its not too bad, but it’s sometimes can be a bit annoying.2 - most of the exercises are too easy, and are almost copy-paste. I need to go over them and create variations of them in-order to strengthen my practical skills. Some exercises are quite challenging though (especially in course 4 and 5), and I need to go over them just to really nail them down, as things scale up quickly. Course 3 has no exercises as its more theoretical. Some exercises have bugs - so make sure to look at the discussion board for tips (the final exercise has a huge bug that was super annoying).3 - there are no summary readings - you have to (re)watch the videos in order to check something, which is annoying. This is partially solved because the exercises themselves usually hold a lot of (textual) summary, with equations.4 - the 3rd course was a bit less interesting in my opinion, but I did learn some stuff from it. So in the end it’s worth it. 5 - Slide graphics and Andrew handwriting could be improved. 6 - the online Coursera Jupyter notebook environment was a bit slow, and sometimes get stuck.

Is the course a good introduction? Yes. Prof. Ng takes you from ""a neural what"" to ""damn, my deep learning model predicts cat images with 80% accuracy!""Does it have a lot if insightful content?Yes and no:Prof. Ng's lectures are articulate, constructive, easy to follow and comprehensible.But the quizzes are insufficient in my opinion, you should provide us with many more optional quizzes that stimulates our understanding and creativity.Moreover, shouldn't there be a book which really builds our imagination and inspires us to think outside the box?I understand that someone as busy as Prof. Ng can't possibly make more lectures, the lectures are already ""optimized"" (I can't stop stop with the puns! :D )But maybe a TA could generate optional video tracks, which go deeper into the topics of the main track.Also, I was continuously struggling while using numpy, even though there were some lectures on some functions of numpy. Dimensions debugging was stressful.Not trying to criticize but the programming assignments felt like a guided tour with little freedom on the learner's part, but that is completely understandable since the learners aren't expected to know how to write hundreds of lines of python code, organize the tasks into elegant functions and data structures.One more terrifying thing in the assignments was the sheer number of variables:OH MY GOD, my active memory was failing to retain which variables were being outputted and where these need to go to next. ""I just got W1 and W2, also b1 and b2, but wait, what is this parameters thing. Oh cool, its a multidimensional array. Where did this cache come from? why can't we just call it Z1? this back prop function is really roasting my brain; too. many. variables...

I guess, this may be necessary to ensure that people get the concept in an online course, but sometimes, I find it too repetitive (and I lose focus). There is a consisted effort by the professor to avoid maths (specifically calculus). I find the aversion to mathematics rather surprising. If we look at Ian Goodfellow's Deep Learning book, almost 33% of the book is dedicated to learning linear algebra/probability/calculus. IMHO, maths must not be avoided, but rather embraced.

2259478~COURSE!~W_mOXCrdEeeNPQ68_4aPpA,1534058949085,4,0,"Thanks! Great refresher. Comments on the code could be more descriptive rather than ""Linear -> Sigmoid"".. something along the lines of what's actually going on - providing more of a high level picture/ mapping of how all the functions will work together earlier, similar to what you did for the very last programming exercise for this course (e.g. a quick list of inputs and outputs of all the functions and how they are meant to be used ). Naming convention on variables could be less confusing also (i.e. duplication of variable names both inside and outside of functions and their parameters). It was easy to get lost going back and forth - having the 2-layer network right next to the L layer network was almost more confusing than just to generalize the whole thing from the start. You seem to be re-teaching the old and inefficient ways of doing things just because you are comfortable with them multiple times during these videos.. just stick with the new stuff and stop comparing it to the old stuff - again, people start with your courses, not finish with them after doing this stuff for years using the old ways. Also you used a LOT of tuple assignment across multiple functions which were sometimes hard to follow back and forth. The code is hard to debug for beginners since you can't actually see any of the dimensions of the intermediate matrices as they only exist inside of the defined functions. Please also (along the same lines) be a LOT more clear (lectures and notebooks) on when you use a dot product or a regular matrix multiplier. Your brain just either works way different than mine or you aren't very consistent/ apparent with your notation (e.g. on the matrix multiplication). The course format has definitely taken a big step forward using Python and remote Jupyter notebooks and I have to thank you profusely for that. The course still suffers from what I would characterize as a ""university feel"" for obvious reasons - meaning you seem to teach by inadvertently developing misconceptions or incomplete pictures of the material in your students, making them figure out what will actually work on their own, thereby learning because of the difficulty. Not the most efficient way, but it works. I had a prof in university teach 3D multi-variable calculus who made that seem easy compared to this stuff, when all we're really dealing with here are variables, python functions, and linear algebra. Anyways, I know that was a lot but just giving some real feedback from someone who has the university basics of engineering but is still familiarizing myself with the finer points of Python. Overall this was a good course and it came well recommended. ",0,0,Jason Leacox,2259478

I for one would like to get into the industry and I don't believe that real life work problems would be presented as simple as the home work assignments. This is just my opinion, I guess it depends on your expectations before the course.In conclusion, I would I highly recommend the course to anyone that knows nothing about machine learning but would like to start.

Unlike my previous course using Octave, this course is using Python. This means that you can benefit from the sea of libraries available for Python community including rich web based libraries such as BeautifulSoup or Requests. Plus, Tensorflow is focusing its support mainly toward Python only, so later, it will be more comfortable to make transition from naive machine learning codes to the Tensorflow framework.Second, this course is divided into several courses. I personally have hard time go though the course at once, so previous course offering 12 chapters just in 4 weeks was quite rushing. Obviously, some people out there can follow that while understanding them all completely, I need time to chew on new field of study before I really get something. Probably I'm doing better because I'm learning similar course again, but I think I would have no problem even if it was my first machine learning class.Yet, I removed one star for this reason: the mathematics part needs more explanation. For example, the video suggested me to derive the cost function myself, yet the derived function I got was a little different than the one provided in the exercise. I kind of get what's going on, but I am a bit uncertain as nobody can check my work. Even if I google search 'Cross Entropy loss derivative,' the cross entropy loss equation used were different site by site.

I consider that I did not waste my money.Now for some poetential improvements:Hand writting is perfect for the fluidity of the course. However, it requires a lot of scrutinity from the learner to discreminate uppercase characters from lower case. ie , w versus W, z versus Z, sometimes I got lost and had to spend some time to understand that what I thought to be an uppercase was a lowercase . same for the indice, i versus 1, etc . I would say that a little bit of care in the hand writting would help the learner....Unless this is on purpose to force learners to spend more time in understanding completely what they learn rather than just applying formulas. Also the course is good to understand the machanisms, but to practice the programming exercizes it  requires a little bit of Python knowledge that just knowing a programming language ( I know Fortran, Pascal, VB ). Sometime I got lost, just because of Python language .For instance  I got stuck for a while  with the  foor loop before I  understood that ""for i in range (1,10)"" stops at 9 . This is not common. Also using dictionary to pass or return parameters in a function is a very  elegant way, but not obvious for a beginner.I listed the reasons why I removed one star, it is pretty long.

After 20 years in the job I took this course just for fun and it was worth it. I was just looking for what is this with all those buzzwords about AI and got a first answer. This course is mostly well structured  and the goals are relative easy to achieve, which I'm considering as good in the case the spare time after work is limited.  As an engineer in electronics and automation,  deeplearning is interesting because for so many problems there isn't an easy mathematical formula which makes me curious  whether this becomes a alternative path for some problems. The prerequisite of knowing calculus and the basics of linear algebra like a matrix multiplication should be standard. Deep learning without this knowledge limits the personal capabilities in this field and is slowing down the learning experience.  There is no magic stick without knowledge.  I couldn't  submit the optional basic exercise, because there is a software problem (formatting) somewhere and it was a waste of 3hours and I got no real help for this problem.

All the maths behind Deep Learning was explained intuitively and illustrated with good examples. I liked the fact that the lecturer went into details for those who are interested - I really recommend  these additional materials, even if you have hard time understanding the calculus and linear algebra.

Programming assignments had thorough explanations and detailed guidance how to approach each exercise. I would say that at some point explanations gave away the answer (if you were well acquainted with materials, of course). I liked that during programming assignments I had to implement every functions myself. This really helped me to gain a general understanding about Deep Learning. And thanks for having tests in the assignments! This really helped a lot, because I was able to debug my code before moving on.There is only one suggestion I would like to make: perhaps it would be easier for students if there are smaller programming assignments right after a topic is covered in a lecture. E.g. forward propagation lectures would have a small programming assignment where one would have to implements few examples for forward propagation. The benefit I would see is learning through repetition - it is easier to learn materials through repeating small chunks at a time.

logical jump. Even those who does not know high-level math can catch up.  He tried to relieve students' concerns and
burdens, any time I lost confidence. After completing the Programming
Assignments, I could be comfortable. The assignments come with detailed
explanations so that students can follow up without much trouble. His fast hand-writing was sometimes a little hard to read
(e.g. ""["", ), but typed summaries could clear them out. Having an interview with Prof. Jeff Hinton was also another
big addition to this course. Actually, this was the time I started to gain more

I was very satisfied with the NLP courses. Therefore, I chose to do the DL specialization as well. Andrew Ng is an amazing educator. The material is very well composed and thought through. I had already studied DL from diverse sources and I must say, the formalism presented here in this course is to date by far the best one I have seen. As a mathematician, I know that notation is power. Good notation will save you a lot of time and help you quickly understand and generalize concepts. Andrew Ng knows that also and put a lot of effort making the whole course very precise and without any loose end. This makes the learning very rewarding and easy to follow. The combination of mathematical formalism and intuition is on point and will help learners with a more programming background and the ones with a more math background as well. This is usually hard to achieve, the correct balance between practice and conceptual definitions. Everyone entering the field should be introduced with this choice of formalism and presentation. Congratulations on developing this notation! My only critique that I must make is the choice of the notation about the partial derivatives of the cost function. I pledge to reintegrate dL/dW into the notation, because this makes it clear with respect to what we are taking derivatives and also easier to get your mind around the chain rule. I hope this will be integrated in a new version of the course. But again, this is a small detail in the big picture. Awesome work! Thanks for providing this to the public at a such a price tag.

 years ago when I first did his course on ML, I was enthralled just by 
the way he 'spoke' and 'drew' Maths. However, it was still one of my 
first MOOCs. I really didn't have much to compare. Moving ahead in time,
 I did plenty of online courses, saw plenty of instructors and came 
across a hundred fancy techniques to make us learn. Yet, I could barely 
find the will to complete things in time. Lately, I thought of trying my
 hand at core DL and I returned to NG, except this time I was deeply 
apprehensive and mostly half-hearted.What followed was pure 
magic. With just a digital pen, a writing pad and plain-old slides, NG 
explained some of the most intricate nuances of Adv. Maths in minutes. 
His ways were older than the whole damn digital age but still more

A small suggestion would be - they could consider a pictorial representation of the matrices involved with the dimensions of W, b, etc. when they marry it across respective Layers and Units per layer. It is cool that the professor derives the formula at each step but a small X x Y matrix alongside generally makes it easier to understand. Lastly - the programming exercises get a little predictable once you understand the flow. All the hard work is done by the folks that have prepared the exercise itself; we are just about keying IN the function names and right parameters sometimes.

Dr. Ng explains everything very thoroughly and provides compelling examples of real world application for the material. Occasionally he can be a bit redundant, but I found that helpful, since sometimes it takes more than one pass through the material to understand it clearly. I am also taking his Machine Learning course (Stanford) concurrently and I found the courses to complement each other very well.Additional practical notes: The linear algebra involved in the course is relatively basic and explained thoroughly enough that it can be picked up along the way if you don't have much math background. Also, the programming assignments help expose you to Python syntax. If you don't have much Python experience, use the discussion forums. If you do, you'll find the assignments to be incredibly easy, as they have ample starter code with a few plug-and-chug ""your code here"" sections. These are mostly just to demonstrate how the material is applied. The primary value in the course is conceptual. For someone with very little coding experience like myself, I appreciate how thoroughly the code was annotated so I could get a grasp on what it was doing without having to stab through trying to produce it myself.

I have not studied calculus, but the careful way Andrew Ng's videos help develop intuitions about the algorithms and the way he introduces notation made it possible for me to get a lot from the course. I've never programmed in python before and it was illuminating to see why its so popular in data science given the power of its math libraries.  I wish I'd had as sympathetic a maths teacher as Andrew Ng when I struggled with it as a callow schoolboy.  My background is that of an experimental psychologist and I was relieved to find that in the section ""what has this all to do with the brain"", that Andrew Ng gave a superb explanation that counters the hype so often found around this kind of AI.

I took the Coursera Math for Machine Learning Specialization before taking this course, and the derivation for the formulas took at least 4 weeks of background material about linear algebra and multivariable calculus. Thus, this course aims to give you a conceptual understanding of neural networks that will allow you to implement it on your own. While some might argue that the programming assignments are too easy, or that too many hints are given, I think they're necessary for guiding you in the correct direction during the assignments. If you take the time to read the prewritten code, you will be able to get the understanding you get from writing it fully from scratch and possibly taking hours to debug and to read NumPy documentation.

I don't think this is necessarily a bad thing, because it makes the student focus more on understanding deep learning rather than spending time writing python-based code (e.g. creating the functions, importing libraries, etc). If you don't have extensive python knowledge, you will be able to do the assignments, but I would recommend to try to understand how the whole code is structured and what each line of code is doing. Also, although Andrew continuously suggests to not worry about the calculus, I think it is helpful (and maybe necessary) to have some basic knowledge of calculus (derivatives) and linear algebra (vectors, matrix multiplication, etc) before doing the course.

As aulas são extremamente didáticas e bem elaboradas, o que torna a familiarização com os conceitos de redes neurais (e a matemática por trás deles) mais natural. As avaliações têm tanto um componente teórico (quizzes, mais voltados para verificação de conhecimentos) quanto um prático (exercícios de programação). Por mais que seja positivo haver o componente prático, eu diria que ele poderia ser um pouco menos ""guiado"" - na prática, o que eles pedem é que o aluno ""complete as lacunas"" em um programa já (muito bem) estruturado (e praticamente completado) pelos professores. Senti a necessidade de complementar esses exercícios com tentativas por conta própria, programando os algoritmos do zero, para de fato assegurar que consigo implementar o que aprendi. Esse passo é sensivelmente mais difícil que os programas do curso (afinal, implementar um projeto do zero é essencialmente desafiador).

You get to develop neural networks from scratch, using just Numpy... no TensorFlow or sci-kit learn. It might take time to think about the code structure and dimensions of matrices of various parameters, but in the end, it only helps in developing a better understanding of how NNs work beneath the TensorFlow/PyTorch  (or any other high-level ML library out there) models in practice. Although the meat of NNs, i.e. calculus, is not really required to complete the course (they provide you with all derivatives required), I'd suggest trying working it all out on paper/iPad/tablet by hand.

Practice along with theory makes course very much interesting. In this course, Python is used which is open source and freely available. But it is difficult to execute downloaded iPython notebook as dataset  ""lr_utils"" is not available. However I could execute the code with other dataset but it was difficult initially. There should be separate video lecture about explaining how to solve assignment because initially it was difficult for me to solve the assignment. Grader was giving grade 0 even though code was right then later I found that I was removing some of the lines in comment region and hence I was getting 0 grade even though source code was correct.

The only objection I have for the course is that for the last programming assignment some functions were precoded but not revealed.

build your own neural network python’s solver in the exercises. “Vectorization”
and “backward propagation” will be demystified and clearly explained.For people
with a good level in math, the pace is certainly too slow and you’ll feel that
the math is too easy, so may be another course is more suited. But at least, you’ll
see all the details, vocabulary and construction steps of a multi-layer neural
network in this course.You are very
guided through the exercises but I think there is no interest in less guidance

There are two things which I want to suggest in your courses .The first thing is you should also teach how to use python libraries for deep learning. This will teach students how to use library in different types of problems. The second thing which I found was the course was bit easy and it should be made little bit difficult by removing certain hints such as formulae. This will force students to make notes seriously while listening your video lectures and implement formulae in their code on their own. ,0,0,Khizr Mohammad Khan,47959303

A good understanding of matrix math, especially matrix multiplication, is a benefit to help navigate the courseThe programming assignments use numpy python and are conducted in a Coursera frame Juypiter notebook.

Advice to any new students on this course would be to have a basic understanding of Machine Learning, which includes linear regression, vectorization et.al. , (or simply, ""ML"" course on Coursera). One small amendment on this course could be to reshuffle the contents a little, from different weeks as I found the content which was in Week 4, to have high importance to be taught earlier in this course (for eg, getting matrix dimension right  ), and there were others sub-topics in week 3 as well. I don't remember all of them, as I  took 4 weeks worth of information, in just a single week :)Very excellently taught, and contents, as well as assignments, were of topmost quality.

I have been reading passively for about  a year on resources related to ML and DL, but never got the full grasp of the concepts the way Prof. Andrew explained them. The quizzes where entertaining and insightful, as well as the programming examples. I completed this 4-week course in about 2 days straight; some of the quizzes were 70/100 at my first try but then got to 100/100 after 1-2 tries. On the programming assignments I got 100/100 on the first try (except for the first one which didn't register my last 3 code answers -even though I typed and ran correctly - for which I had to restart the kernel, launched it again in incognito mode and after I was done re-ran all the snippets one last time just to be sure). The hardest part of the course for me was to understand derivatives and overall calculus development and factorization because I had the necessary classes a few years ago, and honestly I wasn't very good at it back then either. One thing I would suggest would be to improve audio quality, as well as editing the videos instead of providing a warning message before a video with errors because sometimes it's hard to follow the course part let alone spot the error itself.Again, I would like to thank Professor Andrew Ng. and the Deeplearning.ai team, as well as the Coursera platform for providing such great realtime capabilities like the jupyter notebook and the automatic grading system.

48546862~COURSE!~W_mOXCrdEeeNPQ68_4aPpA,1581274037352,5,0,"Good introduction to implementing shallow and deep neural networks in Python. If you have no knowledge of neural networks or Python, I'd suggest doing a little preparatory study first so that you know what a neural network is and feel comfortable writing short Python programs.Theory: the course is not heavy on machine learning theory. I had covered the theoretical parts previously in other courses. This course provided a useful summary of these and left me feeling confident that I had a good overview.Maths: this course doesn't place great emphasis on the mathematics. It shows you the relevant equations, with the emphasis on understanding the underlying concepts rather than going through detailed derivations. Sometimes there's an optional extra video going through the equations in a little more depth. A frequent message is: don't worry if you don't understand all the mathematical detail, you can still learn to implement neural networks effectively.Implementation: the course uses the Python NumPy library throughout. It does not go into deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. From the outset, you are taught to use NumPy in an efficient (""vectorized"") way. The programming exercises are well thought through and I found that they all worked smoothly, a pleasant change from some other courses elsewhere.Overall I found this to be a gentle but satisfying introductory course to the Deep Learning specialisation. Andrew Ng is an excellent teacher. His manner is both calm and enthusiastic and he clearly cares about equipping students with the skills that they need and doing so in an accessible way. The optional ""Heroes of Deep Learning"" interviews were particularly interesting, full of gems and hints about what could lie ahead if you decide to go more deeply into the field.",0,0,Dave Jenkins,48546862

1) Introduction to deep learning
2) Logistic Regression, gradient descent on logistic regression
3) Forward and Backward Propagation
4) Computational graph and how to use the computational graph to calculate the forward and backward prop
5) Shallow Neural Network, and how to work on it end to end
6) Deep Neural Network and it's end-to-end implementation on an application (Classification of cat vs non-cat).

Pros: 
1) The course is in Python
2) The way Andrew Ng sir teaches is simplistic and memorable as he starts from small concepts and relates the same concept in complex problems too. For example:- He started teaching forward and backward prop using logistic regression then he carried the same in shallow neural net and finally on a deep neural net.

Cons: 
1) The number of questions in the video is less as compared to the Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng.
2) There could have been more clarification on a few small topics.
3) The video didn't provide any sort of notes or lecture slides.

Proffessor Andrew Ng answered those questions and also made me think of the NN more intuitively rather than mathematically. I found really impressive that while students with no prior knowledge in calculus can take this course with no problem, others, with good knowledge of calculus, like myself, are not bored even when the most basic concepts are explained (such as derivatives). Also, I liked a lot the cat image binary classification exercises, especially since the classifier was able to classify the well-know cat meme image as a cat picture :P .

Prof. Andrew Ng's extensive breakdown of the structure and function of neural networks work is unparalleled. For me personally this course has been of great help. The theory lectures made me understand just how these networks ""learn"". This course is a great beginning and I think, prepares the student well to learn more in depth and advance concepts of deep learning.However, if you are looking to get hands-on experience building and training deep learning modes I would recommend checking out some free resources on YouTube with  the Keras framework. I played around with with Keras following the YouTube channel Sentdex's Keras tutorials. Then took this course to get a more mathematical and theoretical understanding. Some students might find themselves a bit unprepared for the coding exercises, since the lectures are more focused on theory and math, showing little to no code. This is why I thinks this is a great (if not the best) 2nd course, but maybe not as helpful as a first introduction.For a free first introduction, check out the channel 3blue1brown's videos on Neural Networks to get your feet wet, before diving further deep. ;P",0,0,Amit Robert Baroi,34632341
