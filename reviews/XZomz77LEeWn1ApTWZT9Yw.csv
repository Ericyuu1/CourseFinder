If you are a true beginner (like this class is advertised as) I worry this is the exact thing that would discourage or scare you off from something great. The teacher's instructions are very short and boil down to ""just do it"" which... yes, and no. I​t is an intensive project-centered course, and I know it is free/online, but it gives you so little that the peer-review grades/feedback are meaningless. How are you supposed to peer review on something like formatting or industry best practice if you are a beginner and given no guidance yourself? There are also too many assignments, some of which (again, as someone who majored in this in college and works in the industry) felt like ""busy work"" that doesn't reflect real-world practices. For the script itself, it's almost impossible to complete an assignment and receive enough feedback in time to influence the next step in the writing process. I​ think due to the issues I mentioned, most people fall behind or give up entirely. I am writing this in September 2021, and the last assignment I peer-reviewed had a submission from summer 2020 still waiting for feedback. If you are expecting a writers' room/group vibe: DON'T. I​f you are interested in learning Script Writing: check out some screenwriting books from the library, look at blogs, Google the script of your favorite movie/show as a reference, maybe look for a writers' group in your own community.

3804268~COURSE!~XZomz77LEeWn1ApTWZT9Yw,1468757644662,2,0," This isn't a CLASS it's a workshop.Thank goodness for fee waivers; I would have been so upset if I had spent my money on this course. As someone who has taken Coursera offerings in the past, I cannot cosign the quality of this course.This class seems to suffer from both a lack of structure and time. I believe if the course was longer (allowing for more space between unguided assignments) the class would be a little better. I understand that the Instructor is barred by time constraints (this is only a five week course, and an opt-in one at that), so I do relate to not wanting to inundate the class with reading assignment and lengthy lectures.That said, the guidance and lessons are lacking-- even if the class was longer, I would still only give it 2.5/5 stars.It appeared that the onus was on the Mentors to provide answers; for example, the professor mentioned that our scripts are meant to feature half hour pilots. This left many students writing dramas rather than comedies at a loss, since they were planning for hour long pilots. (This, again, is partially an issue of the class being so short; more time to review = the option to have longer pilots, rather than only accepting half hour pilots in order to allow students to review five different submissions within three days.) Since half hour dramas are unconventional, I asked one of our mentors, JZ (who is great) for examples.The responsibility should not be on the Mentors to find out-- information like that should be included in the prompt; if not discussed in depth, then at least as a link or list of examples to research on your own if you have the time + desire to do so. Especially since the assignment boils down to ""break convention with no examples of successful scripts in this fashion."" In a class presumably allowing beginningeres/greenhorns to participate, this is irresponsible and flawed teaching.The same goes of the ""hints"" that are periodically posted (though again, appreciated!) by mentors in the forums-- those definitions and explanations should be included in the meat of the class, not as supplemental elements. In all honesty, if I didn't have prior experience with writing, I oftentimes wouldn't have any idea what was being discussed by the professor. (And one trip through the forums will illustrate that I am not the only one.)The assignments and due dates are oddly crunched together (another time constraint issue, I understand), but the Instructor's videos seem to imply that we should be receiving feedback before proceeding each time? Maybe in a longer course that would work, but here, I didn't even receive written feedback initially, so it would have been a mistake to wait for some to revise by before forging ahead.
If this class isn't going to provide a solid foundation to build on, then it should be made clear, upfront. There is nothing wrong with an experience based / motivation-focused class, but that aspect needs to be transparent. ""We will not provide 101 teachings/readings."" This isn't a class; it's a workshop. It's a makerspace at best. I expected insight and some level of instruction.In one of the lectures, the Instructor literally says:
""I'm not a big fan of some of the classic story structures, defining in what must happen in each act. Or the problem, the twist, the resolution, rising action, denouement, fine action, etc."" He does not define these terms, nor allude to them ever again. These are key benchmarks in screenwriting. Definitions would be helpful for someone just starting out, even if the Instructor doesn't strictly want us to abide by them. His students should leave the class more informed than when they came.Unless you're lucky and receive a response from a mentor or someone with visible background in script writing, the reviews don't amount to much, because very few enrollees seem to know what is going on enough to provide a meaty assessment. That is the fault of the course, I think, rather than my peers. Likewise, The grading system here is atrocious because of it; few people understand the foundation, and thusly don't know how to format or structure. So to then be graded on a purely pass or fail basis (that, looking through the forums, many students weren't even AWARE of until the first review grades rolled in) is ridiculous. And I am saying that as someone that scored 100% on both assignments that I did stay to complete, so this is not a case of sour grapes, but an observation of inefficiency.I understand that the class is based around ""Active Learning"", but for active learning to work and bear fruit, students should be able to engage with/analyze/synthesize/evaluate/build upon class content. Which necessitates actual, meaningful content. Content beyond my fellow confused peers, and 2 minute videos illustrating various ways of saying ""Write Something Interesting and if it isn't Interesting, people won't care."" Not exactly an astute observation that we couldn't glean anywhere but this course.Honestly, my 4th Edition copy of ""The Screenwriters Bible"" is five times more helpful than this course, and it is about six years out of date.",0,0,Jhenne Tyler,3804268

I understand there's not really a practical solution to grading the amount of stuff that must be coming through the course, especially for people who are already full-time lecturers, but the current peer-review system is kind of broken. First the necessity to get 80 for passing an assignment mean that one trolling or mistaken review can force you to retake an assignment - for example, I had to resubmit act 2 because one of the reviewers gave me 0/100, stating I hadn't submitted it, when the reviewer hadn't bothered checking the attached file, and since there were only 3 reviewers it tanked the entire grade. Second, the fact you know the people you're going to be grading are going to be grading you in return, especially if you're a little ahead of the curve and are constantly getting the same people, means you tend to make your reviews much nicer than they probably should be - I know I've voluntarily neutered some the reviews I gave because I knew the person was going to be among those to grade me.Third, there's no actual incentive to providing actual feedback. Throughout the first assignment, I gave detailed feedback for every single review I made, usually at least a couple paragraph's worth, and justifying any points I might not have given, and I just abandoned that in week 3 because throughout the entire course the only return I got was one comment saying 'boring dialogues' with no added explanation. Commenting on other people's stuff just felt like a waste of time because I knew they wouldn't bother with mine. Maybe make commenting mandatory when grading ?Anyway, I still enjoyed the course and the content, it's just that it's left me a little in the dark as to whether I've progressed or not throughout the whole thing, and left me feeling a little wanting on feedback !",0,2,Arthur Boulanger,30486458

The instruction was simple and spot-on. I'd like it if constructive criticism/feedback were REQUIRED when evaluating others' work. One woman seemed very vindictive after I evaluated her episode, and graded me down after that, which I found really disheartening. Working in groups was mostly a lot of fun, but creating an actual group was a little iffy. We could only scrape together five people, and one finished the course early (or was finishing up a rescheduled course late) and never participated, though he asked that we review his coursework. Another never showed up for any meetings, didn't post, etc., and so was simply never present in the group. The remaining three of us did get a lot out of our meetings, however, and we still share info. What a great way to meet other writers in other countries! That was my favorite part. One of our group had one of her episode acts stolen--her .pdf was copied, the name changed, and it was submitted as the plagiarizer's own work within 24 hours. I don't know if this was resolved, but ""EEEK."" A writer's worst nightmare. How about providing a written .doc or .rtf template/sample of page/element formatting? And links to sites or software for formatting and for script submissions to production companies? I am fortunate enough to have FinalDraft 11, but the formatting was tricky and, I can only imagine, tedious and frustrating for those who don't have it. I also imagine that some students are like ""What now?"" ""Where do I send my finished script?"" after the class.

34368802~COURSE!~XZomz77LEeWn1ApTWZT9Yw,1588181322101,4,0,"This course is intended to support writing a pilot script, which was achieved.The reason why this course go 4 stars- My actual review would be 3.5. is because the Teacher David does not review your work personally,  he does not give you any format for things, Such as a Cold open or a character structure in a few sentences. Ect. Instead, we get a vague overview of a loose structure that doesn't let us know details and specifics. Such as: A cold open is scene that is before and after the script that is about 1 page long and can give a piece of the story that also has a beginning middle end. It must include the main characters and also have as much dialogue as possible.  Also, when writing your character descriptions and your Web bible it is best to write something in 2 or 3 sentences, focus on the core of the characters (""good hearted, KInd"")  Something specific. The reason why I write this is because I have spent numerous nights/ hours reading other people's and mine in the beginning  on characters details and relationships and basically a lot of information that was not needed in the character description. Also, I would spend many hours review people work about this characters past and what they thought and the characters actions as if the script was a novel- not a script.  Which made many stories long with unnecessary sentences. Lastly, to improve this class and mention to future takers of this class,  THIS WHOLE CLASS IS BASED ON PEER REVIEW.  The Class is based on a 0  or a 20 .. nothing in-between. So, if someone doesn't like your work- they won't give you a review that good.,, more or less a 0 which lowers your grade.Be prepared to pour yourself for hours over other people's work that I was not interested in. I am certain others have done that through my work, which may have been alright.  It would be helpful to have this on a 1-5 scale.. only for review.

Reviewers (who are purported to be beginners themselves) also at times give seemingly 'blind' grades without sharing constructive comments. The questions that you are graded on e.g. Do you feel immersed in the story? Is the story unique? are highly subjective and solely dependent on the reviewer's fleeting preferences. It would help if the questions were more nuanced and focused on the structure and technical aspects of script writing e.g. format, grammar, three part structureLessons were too short and instructional (less than 10 mins of videos for each lesson) only for certain areas; it seemed like one of the major takeaways was to keep writing which is sensible but not helpful from a beginner's point of view.

Jumping in and just doing it worked for me, as I tend to spend time reading up and educating myself theoretically before ever getting around to actually writing. Seeing sample scripts and discussions of form and writing criteria is definitely important, as I have managed to learn a lot through looking at many scripts and comparing, so I think there's a place for that in the course, but the actual project base was what really made the difference for me. The grading criteria points with every assignment have functioned as vital checklists in which to review not just my peers, but also my own work as well. I really learned a whole lot more about stretching my limits and what I am capable of doing by actually writing than just by dreaming of doing it one day. My confidence is at an all-time high, and now I am actively revising the pilot and working on the following episodes, as well as actively seeking opportunities for further courses, contests, and screenwriter communities and associations. Thank you, David. Before this course, I never actually thought I'd do it, and decided to sign up on a whim because I love writing and I love film and TV, but I never even considered screenwriting as a career or an option, and now this has all been changed. I am forever grateful.
