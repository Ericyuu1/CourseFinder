51385489~COURSE!~QPsZPf2gEeSvCSIAC12B5Q,1587312162534,2,0,"Initially I was excited about this course; however over half of the material is repeated in videos by lecturers.  Even the lectures about the mechanisms of the ebola virus specifically included little to no imagery which would have improved the understanding of it.  Although I did learn a few new things about ebola, most of the course is incredibly repetitive about how healthcare workers protect themselves, the ethics of caring for Ebola patients, and how Emory set up the first containment unit for Ebola patients in the US.

My only criticism (and why I only gave it 4 stars) was the unbridled self-congratulatory tone and Emory-centeredness of the course. I realize this is probably a function of why Universities create these free courses. There is a marketing aspect to it. But it did get a little tedious. ",0,0,Madeleine Morris,8501684

I highly recommend it to the pupil who're interested in these types of case studies on diseases which awoke the health systems all over the globe.
