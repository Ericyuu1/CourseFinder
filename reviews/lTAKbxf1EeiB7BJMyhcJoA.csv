Philosophy of data analysis is all good and well, but there is no technical instruction to go with it. Quizzes and labs stress technical details for which there is no instruction.  Readings are a hodge-podge of unlabelled links with no prioritization or curation. Labs take 15 mintues to start up, and then have 1-2 hour timeouts, at the end of which you lose all work you have done. There is little to no instruction in the labs: the only way to do them is either already understand what their topics (making them pointeless) or to quickly google up answers to technical questions, and blindly run functions (which is also pointless).I have no idea how this course sequence was ever rated as an interesting one for qualification.

By splitting on a date-hash you are not choosing a random sample. For example, in both the airplane and taxi example, If more winter dates were samples, we would expect more delays and longer taxi rides (and thus more expensive). Wouldn't it be better to split randomly, but reproducibly? In both R and Python SKlearn library you can 'set the seed' when splitting the data which seems like a much less biased and just as reproducible way to split the dataset.
