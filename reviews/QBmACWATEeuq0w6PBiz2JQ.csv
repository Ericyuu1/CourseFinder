85879524~COURSE!~QBmACWATEeuq0w6PBiz2JQ,1635875874096,1,0,Quicklabs support is poor. Labs fail to implement (labs in weeks 2 and 3). Instructions are not clear for some labs. This is the las module in this specialization. It is pity that the last module wasnt implemented well and spoils the whole impression for the entire course. ,0,14,GK,85879524

2473920~COURSE!~QBmACWATEeuq0w6PBiz2JQ,1618183261706,1,0,"The Good: The instructors were clear and concise and provided just the right amount of context and justification for the concepts they presented. The Bad: The labs were very burdensome, unstable, and provided very little toward the learning for the course. Even worse: The Qwiklabs experience, having to interact with their support multiple times, was unbelievably frustrating; Bad enough in fact that I doubt I would ever take another Coursera course if it is coupled with Qwiklabs. Very unfortunate.",0,44,Daniel Lauzon,2473920
12807044~COURSE!~QBmACWATEeuq0w6PBiz2JQ,1662219657033,2,0,"The course content is advanced and great for theoretical learning. The practice labs and support by Qwiklabs make it a 2 star course as the 1) content of the labs are not updated to the latest vertex AI platform and outdated2) the python virtual environment package dependencies are insufficient3)the Qwiklabs instances that are provided are not powerful enough to complete labs in the given time.4) Support from qwiklabs point to the same lab instructions but no additional inputs to fix the issuesAlso, the issues mentioned above have been outstanding for over 6 months and unfortunately this course is not updated and is a blocker to earn the Coursera GCP ML Professional Certificate.I have tried each of the labs 2-3 times but could not complete them due to aboveOn the positives, this is good course for advanced practices and capabilities of ML pipelines on GCP. Also, this is the only course that I had challenges finishing labs and I completed labs of 8 of 9 courses without issues seamlessly.Thanks Coursera and I hope Qwiklabs revises the content",0,2,Chaitanya Kartheek,12807044
