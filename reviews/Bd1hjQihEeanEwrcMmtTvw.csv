At present the course is mediocre to bad: its educational value is low: transcripts are disgusting, they are not proofread, omitted pats of sentences, inconsistent English, they almost completely obscure, disrupt the sense of the presentation. The course offers no slides. I see obvious negligence in preparation of many lectures (especially bad week three). The target audience for the course is professional biologist that are comparable with arithmetic and elementary algebra and can easily use an internet browser. The course contains numerous mistakes: in particular, the elementary formula Dr. Cecilia Lasser presented in her week 4 lecture on Differential Ultracentrifugation contains an error.The lectures presented by non-native English speakers are very difficult to understand because of poor & inconsistent English.Please, make the lecture slide available for your students. Please, arrange a forum giving a possibility to ask a questions and get understanding of the material that remains unclear.The lectures on electron microscopy were very good, - thank you, Johanna!The lectures on AFM was the only one that was just excellent, - Thank you,  Dr. Shivani Sharma.Please, review the sequence of lectures: I think the week 5 material may be moved to week 3.",0,2,Shukhman Boris,4578415
