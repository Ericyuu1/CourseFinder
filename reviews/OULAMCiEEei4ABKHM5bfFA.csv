3828758~COURSE!~OULAMCiEEei4ABKHM5bfFA,1560241094430,5,0,"Last course on the Specialization. It cover advanced graphics and visualizations, such as visualizing geographical data, temporal data, network data and interactive visualizations with multiple views.  What I liked the most is the vast quantity of examples reviewed and the assignments which consisted of producing your very own low fidelity sketches of the topics given in each week.I would totally recomend to anyone who wants to dive deep in data visualization techniques and expand visual vocabulary.
