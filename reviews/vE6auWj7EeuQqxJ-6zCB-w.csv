97769530~COURSE!~vE6auWj7EeuQqxJ-6zCB-w,1644501836594,3,0,F​irst: Please know that this project does NOT have a resource section where you can download what you have done - so - you need to copy paste the code for reference (or you can always come back and revisit later if you have a subscription).T​his course is too basic - but gives you a good idea of what to do. Seaborn and 3D plot is just brushed at the surface  - so if you are here for these - better read the contents section.I​ wanted to understand how to make surface maps and contour maps - but these were hardly touched. I​nstructor is good and has clear pronunciation - so please do not take this review as any point towards the instructor. The structure is very basic - but it is a breat place to begin if someone is new to graphs.,0,1,Parag,97769530
