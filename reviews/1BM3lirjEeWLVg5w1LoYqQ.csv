This is quite devastating for me. I can read the slides myself (although I have to download it first, since the fonts on the screen are very small). What I need is the professor to explain the logic behind the formulas, the *why* behind what is written, instead of just reading *what* is written on the slides.I find it amusing that with an expected learning of 8 hours a week, the total duration of the first week's videos add up to a mere 36 minutes. A couple of weeks ago I have just finished a course that subjectively is comparable in its difficulty level. That course is also rich in mathematical content and also requires a commitment of 4-8 hours per week. Each week, the duration of the lecture videos amount to somewhere between 120-150 minutes - and the lecturer didn't read slides; instead, he would explain the logic behind the concepts and provided papers for learners to read on our own time. That approach really helped scaffold my learning.I hope you'd consider revisiting this course's learning plan - or probably just state on the course info page that this course is more suitable for a refresher course rather than an introductory one.",0,48,Deleted Account,2054265

Someone who is relying only on the math prep they give you in the course will likely be very under-prepared for some of the more theoretical homework assignments.With that disclaimer out of the way, this course gives a fairly good overview of important econometric techniques, though I wish they would have done more with time series analysis.A major shortcoming of this course is some of the more complicated material (RESET test, Chow test, endogeneity, etc) were not presented in a complete way (in my opinion). I found myself referring to quite a few outside sources in order to figure out some of the more complicated material.

The only minor complaint that I have is that it still lacks some material on how to apply the methods using common programming languages or statistical software.

The fact is that to apply econometric theory one needs to understand  fair bit of econometric method (that includes matrix algebra, some properties of  inner product space etc.) as well as how to apply those concepts in practice. In this respect this course does serve its purpose very well. Overall, this course focuses some fundamental aspects  and properties of cross-sectional data and time series data. Therefore, it provides one  a good foundation (over 8 weeks) so that one can carry out one's future quest regarding any empirical topic by oneself ! I admit that modern econometric theory develops more sophisticated techniques but all of them share one common aspect i.e. they are based on more or less the same fundamentals or properties. Indeed, this course has been designed carefully by targeting  those fundamentals  and properties. Thus it might be very helpful to follow the modern econometric techniques.However, this course does not talk about the panel data analysis, which share both the cross-sectional and time series properties (more or less). In my opinion it might be better to have at least additional one week session on panel data. In particular, when the data set shares both cross-sectional and time series properties, which  set of properties will  be dominant or how the estimation technique incorporates the variation of two dimensions (i.e. cross-sectional  and time ) etc.  Finally, I like to thank all the teaching members  and moderators of this course.
