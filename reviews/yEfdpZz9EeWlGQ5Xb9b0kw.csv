90733845~COURSE!~yEfdpZz9EeWlGQ5Xb9b0kw,1654839832249,1,0,"As I said for the foundation course of this specialization also, the course framework and reading materials are OK. The reason for a 1 star rating is the design of the evaluation system. There are too many peer-graded assignments with subjective answers giving chance to overly-competitive participants to downgrade assignments unnecessarily. But this is not all, there are so many many plagiarised or blank submissions that it is difficult to find the required number of assigments to rate.The flagging of plagiarised or irrelevant submissions are not even attented to. This causes loss of motivation to complete the course. I would suggest to evolve the evaluation system as I believe the aim should be that the participants get to learn something and not get demotivated to even complete the specialization.",0,0,Vikram Kaushik,90733845

The course is very informative and has a lot of content. However, the 
professor's speech has too many distracting pauses. It's hard to keep my
 eyes open while watching the videos. To reduce the pauses, he should write down his lectures as transcript first, since

No offense meant, but I barely managed to complete it just because I had told myself I need to do it.I came back again to this course to check on something, saw that the content seemed to have changed quite a bit and so decided to have a look at it again.  Surprisingly, it was so much more interesting now because I found the content and structure had been revamped and so I decided to audit the course - again. I am glad I did because now I have decided to go in for a free trial and see how it works for me as it is so much better in presentation and in the sequence of the lessons and lecture videos.  Also, I am thankful to both the professors for really making the lectures also interesting.  A vibrant lecturer engages the student much better and keeps the interest levels high.  Otherwise someone reading from a teleprompter can be a real dampener.Just one request - if the professors can speak just a bit slowly during their lectures.  I understand the lectures are meant to be in the conversational mode but still.  I have had many American colleagues over the past years and am quite used to the accent/s, but when it is a lecture and I am a student, it would help with a slight reduction in speed.  :-)Otherwise, thank you so much Professors Bednar and Love.",0,1,Dr. Neeldeepsingh Sarvaiya,47647449
