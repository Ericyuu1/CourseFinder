I felt that a lot of background knowledge of Agile was required, and since I did not have that, I spend more time looking up the references the teacher made in the lectures than on the lectures themselves.

Good observation of business model canvas framework and good linkage to particular user stories.However, this course has nothing to do with IT STRATEGY mentioned in its title.

Content of the course does not touch true strategic topics critical for IT division - infrastructure strategy, sourcing strategy, IT organization model, financing, definition of AS-IS and TO-BE states, roadmap development, program and projects management.
