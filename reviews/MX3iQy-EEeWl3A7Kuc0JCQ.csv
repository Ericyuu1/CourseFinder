I wish there were more examples and more exercises because some concepts are really hard to understand. Some written notes along with the videos would be really helpful.   ,0,0,Emmanuel Druet,27933328

Also, it provides a very clear introduction to modal mu-calculus, which is something that I never would have had a chance to learn were it not for this fantastic, very clear, and consice course.
