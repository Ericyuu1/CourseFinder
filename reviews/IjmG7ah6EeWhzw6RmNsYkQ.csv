If you miss a single piece of information, you can't complete it due to a 4-out-of-8 selection question every week which you HAVE to answer correctly. After reviewing all videos of week 4 twice, I quit.
- Lectures often lack a continuous thread to follow. Back and forward jumps in time are common. Timelines at the end sometimes help, but are shown too late.- The forum is abandoned! To the point of time there are three (!) posts in the forum and none of the forum operators. No one is taking care of it.- The lecturer's English is not good, but understandable.

Even though there's a lot going on in that part of the world the course shows the true facts of how the civilizations back then evolved and their days of glory and downfall. Jerusalem was small and regarded as remote to the great nations back then but it's interesting how much Jerusalem and Israel as a whole were much involved with all the history being made so long ago. I'd recommend this to anyone with an interest.,0,0,David Hearst,25565446

However, my point is that such a topic, with lots of information, names and chronologies, could not be taught otherwise. I would like to thank Professor Oded Lipschits, as well as his entire scientific team for the excellent course.

written documents is an approach that works quite well.  Professor Lipschitz’ use of maps in the
lectures really helps to follow the battles and takeovers throughout the
Fertile Crescent.  I also have to
recognize the excellent lecture that Professor Cohen presented on the
Babylonian Chronicles.  I hope at some
point, Professor Cohen is able to present a full class on Assyriology.  I will also sign up for any additional
