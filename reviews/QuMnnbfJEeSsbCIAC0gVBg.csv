I wanted to explore about the narrative in online games, not focus on Tolkien's life and works. I also dislike the live discussion parts of the lessons. The idea's great, but some of them weren't very thorough and felt more like comments. I liked the breakdowns a lot better.",0,1,Tatum Derin,28544042

They ask to many questions with multiple answers and the online student is expected to know so much more materials that is probably taught in the actual class, and does not have access to. For that it becomes frustrating. Especially that the material is not easy to digest. ",0,1,Matt,2946253

This part also serves to show how many videogames have taken elements of this narrative into their own.

Studying it in the context of English Romantic quest narratives and poems changed my perspective.  Beyond that, the world of online gaming was opened to me.  I had viewed games from a distance with fascination but they missed my generation and so I had never dived in.  As a newbie gamer over 60, it WAS a steep learning curve but I loved the challenge and the community I met in the game.  Such a lively and nice bunch of people.
