73929891~COURSE!~jzbpPAmrEeutYApDK7IjMQ,1666686132415,5,0,"K​eatron is an amazing instructor! Really amazing! He walks you through the process of digital forensics from A-Z, and guides you on the essentials tools and commands to use. His explanation and voice are both very clear, the course materials and structures are all well-planned and organized, and the contents are relevant to the field very much.I​ would recommend anyone planning to take this to have some level of understanding first in computer systems or Information Security in general. The first 2 courses in the Specialization guides you through the high level process and elements in IR, but the third course will take you into the technical stuffs. Some knowledge in Linux would be great too.I​ went through the course first time a while back, but decided that I'll come back when I have some solid foundations. And yeah the second time I managed to follow through the materials quite well. Highly recommended to take!",0,0,Che Ariffin Che Aris,73929891
