There was no mentor that helped with the problem (There was another thread that has since been deleted). It was only until another user mentioned putting everything in LineSegment after the BruteCollinearPoints and FastCollinearPoints. However, this approach is generally not a good practice since you now have two outer classes in two different files, and the class LineSegment is the same in both. It also means that you will always lose 5% due to style checks, since we are forced to put the class of LineSegment into each java files (Brute and Fast).

52682528~COURSE!~yQcuJCOcEeagwg7hVay0BQ,1643993281165,3,0,"BE WARNED...not for the faint of heart.I graduated top 10% of my class for both BS and MS in EE from the University of Florida, and led a startup to a successful acquisition.(Although I have limited programming experience)I have done hard things, and this course is TOUGH.You will be challenged, and you will learn.This course is really a high-level overview/summary, and requires lots of self-resourced learning.It essentially shows you what you need to learn, provides an overview, and then provides a very challenging assignment.There are many characteristics of this course that are frustrating, and some even ""bad"".If I had to pay significantly for this course, I would have given it 2 stars.(I believe many of the other reviews may be from students who did NOT complete the assignments themselves.)That said, it is still a good course, and worth taking.First, some positives:- This course is FREE.It is INCREDIBLE to have access to these learning resources at no cost.- The instructor truly is an expert in the field, and very clearly presents the material.- This course covers a wider breadth of topics than other Algorithm & Data Structure courses.- There are automated tests for each assignment, so you can test your code, and to a high level.And now, for the WARNINGS:- The time estimates for the assignments are laughably WRONG.NO reasonable student could complete the assignments in 8 hours.Bet on closer to 3-5 days working full time (24-40 hours), maybe more, for each. Even the online TAs say that the assignments took them days to complete.- The assignment descriptions are NOT complete.You will complete everything listed in the assignment specification, and then still fail some of the automated tests, as they impose additional requirements and test things not mentioned in the spec.Use the forums and FAQs for insight into the additional requirements.- The lectures included in this course provide very helpful summaries, but do NOT thoroughly cover all material.You do NOT get access to all the lectures from the equivalent course at Princeton, only a select and abbreviated subset.The content of the lectures is very good, but the presentation is extremely dry. Dr. Sedgewick is a capable man, but not an inspiring or entertaining presenter (in these lectures, at least). - You will have to do LOTS of self-learning from other sources to complete the assignments.I strongly recommend buying the textbook.It helped me incredibly after I finally chose to buy it.- This course DOES require Java-specific competency, despite its claims.Over 100 pages of the textbook are devoted to specific intricacies of Java.I was not familiar with Java and had to spend more than 1 week (40-50 hours) learning Java before I could even start the course assignments. I then spent at least an additional week (40+ hours) learning the more advanced Java features this course requires: Generics, custom Iterators, custom “Comparable” and “Comparator” interfaces, etc.So, add that to your time estimates for this course if you are not already competent in Java.I want to give a sincere thanks to the TA(s) who are still very actively involved on the forums!Over 15 years on, I would say this is still a good course.If you want to learn Algorithms, this is a good option.

Nearly all coding interviews will ask about these concepts as well, so this material has lots of value in finding a job. The explanations are detailed, and the visualizations for the various data-types are fairly good.    That said, there is room for improvement. After the first couple of assignments, I switched to auditing this course, because of all the issues.        - The content was not migrated very well, resulting in many/most exercises having disclaimers that they haven't been migrated yet, and others having links to resources that will need a few extra step to work. I think the materials might just be out of sync with the assignment descriptions, but they certainly didn't go smoothly for me. 
        - Practice problems have hints, but no answers. It's useful to think through, but you either know the answer, or you don't. You're probably better off just working through problems on codeforces.
        - Long lecture format was from a traditional classroom. This works alright, but feels a bit bloated in comparison to other Coursera courses I've taken. The checkpoints are trivial, and added after production, so they didn't add much either.",0,2,Trevor Clark,537485

20724894~COURSE!~yQcuJCOcEeagwg7hVay0BQ,1589659808580,4,0,"Mostly good. I think the instructions could use some cleaning up.  Below are some notes I took during the course.Improve the assignment specifications by getting rid of terminal command mistakes. Ex: Queues assignment shows terminal with “java Permutation 3 < distinct.txt”. However, this will create an error. Correct command is “java-algs4 Permutation 3 < distinct.txt”. This is extremely frustrating to students as they are struggling with the java syntax and this specific development environment already.Add additional links in the assignment to the book site example codes. The most frustrating part of this class was dealing with java syntax. While being able to program is a prerequisite, I haven’t used java before and dealing with the nuanced syntaxes for the various interfaces was extremely frustrating until I found the helpful examples on the booksite. Some links would have helped a lot and I wouldn’t have been searching stack overflow for hours on some assignments.Clearer instructions on the IDE installation website. A couple of warnings were after the instruction that the mistake could have been made on. Add additional warnings for people from other classes that the hello world program is intended only for one of the several classes that use that site. That was buried in the fine print. Or better yet, add the hello world project to the coursera class so everyone can follow the instructions on the IDE installation website.Open the codepost website for IDE installation help with a smaller fee. Having trouble installing a development environment is something a lot of online programming courses get wrong and is extremely frustrating to students trying to learn programming for the first time.Poll students so you can get a better idea of how long the homework assignments took. It took me about 4x longer than the estimate for the collinear homework assignment.Don’t have the first homework due 2 days into the class. I’m not sure if the class is setup to always have the first assignment due that quickly or if it is because I started on a Sunday, but this really is an unattainable goal unless you already are very familiar with both java and the IntelliJ IDE, and have 8 hours within the next couple of days. Then the student is behind for the rest of the class. I think giving the student at least 5 days from start would improve the student experience greatly.Fix the forum search feature so that after you click to search the forums, the text field to search doesn’t have to be clicked again.",0,0,Brett Mattas,20724894

The homeworks were quite challenging, but I thought they were all very fun topics and as others mentioned you really feel a great sense of accomplishment from finishing them. I came into this class with no prior Java programming experience.  The first and second homeworks were difficult for me as I was struggling with the language while trying to solve the problems.  I think the way the course is structured (and to a greater extent the book) if you have a rudementry Java programming background (or experience with another languge--python for me) the basics of working with Java are described, and there is enough information and examples given to help you learn Java while you learning algorithms.    Reading along with the course is a big committment (500 pages); a compromise that would be helpful for someone new to java is to read the fundimentals chapter (chapter 1), which is still 100 pages, but provides a solid enough introduction to Java (for someone with prior programmming experience).",0,0,Eric Gharakhanian,94322982

In all seriousness, the course was incredibly tough for me (someone who is not a compsci major) but was also very rewarding. It took me 6 weeks to complete and probably around 10 hours per problem set. Kdtrees was the most interesting pset and collinear points the least (wording was slightly confusing for me).I would like to provide the following advice for those who are struggling but really wish to complete it. 1. Go through the lectures and try to implement the data structures yourself (unless he says it's not necessary e.g. llrb tree) e.g. in week 1, I made my own QuickFind and QuickUnion class. It doesn't have to be perfect but it helps to grapple with the idea.2. Always look at the FAQ and command line input/output example. Coupled with reading the specification clearly should clear up 90% of the issues in what you are required to implement (unless it's the collinear points pset). If still confused, reading the discussions may be helpful.3. Try to do the psets when your brain is working at its best. Writing something half baked late in the night will probably lead you to take longer than if you hadn't written anything at all. 4. Lastly, have patience. The fact that you're struggling so much means that you have the most to gain from solving the psets. Focus on the learning gains you will get rather than the difficulty you're having right now and you'll see it's all worth it in the end.Thank you very much for making this high quality resource publicly available at no cost.",0,4,Hyun Kwak,72066984

In my opinion, that is not a probelm at all, if you are strong in some other language, say C++, it is very easy to adapt and in the process you end up learning, not just Data Structures and Algorithms, also a new language, Java, which is a very widely used language. People should see it as a boon, since it gives double returns for your efforts.

I am guilty of not finishing many courses on coursera, but this one kept me hooked and motivated enough to keep coming back at regular intervals and actually finish. The actual learning from the course is more than just algorithms as we get detailed feedback on style and even some design aspects of the code we submit. The only downside of such depth assessment review system is that we are forced to use Java for the solutions, sometimes which can have its own learning curve, and hard to get 100% score because of some nitpicks which are not worth spending time to fix for a course assignment (they would be for actual production code though). Also, the specs provided are sometimes missing requirements which we only find out by submitting once and reading the assessment with failed tests.One thing that I think should be improved is the hint system for quizzes. After we submit, in most cases the hints are not enough to understand how to solve the problem. So it leaves you less fulfilled than ideal, knowing there is unsolved problem out there and no real help.Overall, totally recommended.",0,1,Vaibhav Pujari,5646711

I also purchased the book that accompanies the course, and the book is also of excellent quality and was an invaluable resource for understanding the course content and for progressing through the programming assignments (especially when I got stuck on a tough part).I would also say that there is a very cool theme running through the course, that of ""brains over brawn"", i.e. that clever algorithms can still make massive huge and important improvements to applications even though in this day and age we now have an abundance of memory and processing power at our disposal.

Why?, because you will learn a lot of skills beyond the algorithms taught in the course, (which by the way are all awesome, for example, you will learn to implement the kd-tree algorithm and also how it is used for computer graphic acceleration and how it's implemented in the famous machine learning algorithm k-NN, and if you dive a little more in the material you will be able to run the famous flocking boids algorithm developed by Craig Reynolds in the field of artificial life)By working on the project assignments, you will learn by doing the best practices in OOP, coding style and documentation writing. And most importantly, you will gain the skills necessary to think algorithmically to effectively solve hard problems and how to write fast and memory-efficient code. All those skills will be very useful when you work on your own projects.Also, you will understand why a good algorithm worths much more than a supercomputer and the importance of its study, because knowing about algorithms will make you able to answer questions like: how do I know if the algorithm I'm writing is the best option available to solve this kind of problem?, Does my algorithm scale well with the size of the problem I'm trying to solve? and much more. After completing this course you will be able to answer all these very important questions and you will have the right skill set to tackle real-world problems.

On the other hand, writing assignments feels like doing a Java project on your own. This feels not bad since it's not easy for programming noob like me to explore and participate in projects on GitHub owing to lack of confidence : (. BTW the autograder is so awesome that it even examines your Java code style! This is pretty good for students who had learned C/C++ before to form a better code style in Java. For the videos, it's pretty good for novice (I've been confusing for a long time to find a good way to start and learn Data Structure). However, in other words, the CS knowledge taught in this course is far beyond needed. It's still necessary to drill yourself on other sites like LeetCode, and learn the relevant mathematical algorithm analysis (maybe by reading Introduction To Algorithm).

25965969~COURSE!~yQcuJCOcEeagwg7hVay0BQ,1571880449945,5,0,"Great course. It's both a Java programming course and an algorithms course that focuses on data structures. There is some mathematical analysis and proofs, but they are hand wavy and not the core of the course.  The assignments are very fun, they are typically visual and require the use of that week's material to solve a clever application (usually you just use the code developed instead of coding it from scratch, but occasionally will have to implement your own) - they can take between 4-12 hours to do.  Lectures provide excellent animations and motivations that walk you through different algorithms and help you visualize the results as well as help you appreciate why they matter. Along the way you'll develop your Java skills by learning about some of the features of the language.To succeed you should know basic Java, up to interfaces, generics, iterators, and basic command line arguments, recursion, and how to implement classic ADTs like stacks, queues, linked lists, (maybe binary search trees as well). These things are reviewed, but there isn't much in the way of exercises or assignments to reinforce the ideas, so it isn't meant as a first exposure. A lot of learners come to this course already knowing the material and using this as a refresher. That wasn't the case with me, this was my first time seeing things like hashing and balancing trees, and it was all very approachable. I would say the difficulty is at the level of a second year university course. The assignments also give really good feedback not just of tricky corner cases and correctness, but stylistic changes to improve your code. This feedback is as though you had a human walk by line by line in your code and point out bugs and stylistic errors. By the end you'll not only improve your algorithmic thinking by directly working with the results in your code, but you'll also become a better Java programmer and get practice with abstract interfaces such as Comparators and Iterators.Looking forward to Part 2!",0,19,Jack,25965969

However, I would have to say that this is the best online course I've taken so far. The subject matter revolves around some of the most fundamental algorithms for computer science and emphasizes the importance of data representation. The choice of Java as a programming language for this course helps emphasize the distinction between data structures and abstract data types. The lectures relate the material to concrete and interesting real-world applications but also occasionally mention related open problems in computer science. The instructor is very clear in his explanations, which often make use of excellent and helpful visualizations.

7045832~COURSE!~yQcuJCOcEeagwg7hVay0BQ,1546414572355,5,0,"I've completed both Part I and Part II. So my review belongs to two of the courses.I took this course to gain a better understanding of data structures and algorithms and also to learn more about the Java language.Best way to learn algorithms is through visualization. In this course, Professor Sedgewick slowly but steadily presents each algorithm and data structure with dynamic visualization. The animations really help to clarify exactly how the algorithms process the data and solve a problem.Another important aspect is that this course discusses the implementation details of the algorithms by using Java programming language. They developed a java library where almost all the algorithms in a traditional algorithm text-book have been implemented. It's really satisfying to read such nice, concise and elegant code.I started this course with an intermediate level of knowledge on Java. That's why it was pretty easy for me to keep pace with the implementation challenges. However, I learn and apply many java specific technique such as generics, iterator, object equality, immutability, testing etc. in-depth in this course. From my experience, I would recommend, to get the most out of the course, you should have a little bit of programming experience in Java.In order to pass the course, you have to complete a programming assignment in each week. The assignments are well written, pretty much challenging and fun to solve. You will get the feelings to solve large-scale complex problems. They expect you to spend 3-5 hours for an assignment to pass (80%) each assignment. However, I lost track of how much time I spent to chase the benchmarks for 100% in each assignment. You will definitely have a challenging time to score 100%.The evaluation system of the assignment is very sensitive. You have to maintain a prescribed API, otherwise, your solution will not be accepted. I wonder about their effort, how much time they spend to make such unit testing code. In some cases, I see that they wrote 1200-1500 lines of unit testing code to check our only 200-300 lines of solution, definitely praiseworthy!Overall, this was a great course and it was a great opportunity for me to take such an enriched algorithm course. I highly recommend it to every serious programmer who wants to learn more about data structures, algorithms, and the Java language.",0,53,Maruf Hassan,7045832

I felt really rewarded for each assignment completed.I was taking this as a refresher (took Algorithms in college), and found the lectures much more interesting this time around.  For example, the way Red-Black trees were explained as an implementation of 2-3 trees, made the algorithm much easier to understand than how I learned it before, which was that a red-black tree is a binary tree maintaining such-and-such invariant blah blah blah.
