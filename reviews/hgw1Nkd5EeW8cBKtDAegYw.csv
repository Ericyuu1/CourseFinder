56632980~COURSE!~hgw1Nkd5EeW8cBKtDAegYw,1661532009785,1,0,"Only course in this specialization where I've had any issues with peer grading system. It's like they had 2 or more different final submissions on a coupl eof the weeks and the software doesn't accurately serve up graded projects with their correct submission rubrics. For example, week 4 asks you to code a program using PWM to gradually light a LED and then dim it. Yet many of the submissions that I saw were related to the Twython project discussed in the videos yet the grading rubric was for the LED lighting. This course really jumped all over the place with topics and how they went together as well.",0,0,Steve Radabaugh,56632980

I tested different computers, windows and mac operating systems, different browsers, different security settings, etc. Nothing works. The assignment is also way beyond the level of an introductory course. In addition, the complete lack of discussion forums attached to the course suggests that it is preferable to shut off discussion than to address the problems. Speaking of which, a search of the general forums indicate that this has been an ongoing issue since the latter half of 2015. Seriously, what the hell?

When peer reviewing code, I cannot copy the code and paste it in the Arduino IDE, what is this? More practice for typing code line by line into the IDE? The people doing the assessments are also a huge problem, especially so with the earlier courses, very little people put effort into submitting quality work, some submissions are even empty and contain some random text, and if you give them a low score they will give u a low score regardless of your submission quality.

The assignments in particular seemed trivial, and were compromised even further due to some technical problems with the simulator recommended for students without access to actual hardware.This course would be a good candidate for revision, with a focus on gradually increasing the depth and complexity from stage to stage, and on commonly-used components such as current amplifiers and shift registers.

That was a bit lost on me, mainly because i didn't really appreciate why i should want to (I can understand many reasons, but none felt very close at hand). I think it would have been more enjoyable with useful examples and practice.Ok, the course is still worth doing, but i think there is much room for creating a smooth and enjoyable learning process.

It is not a bad thing to have such a basic course exist, it is a good thing, but there are definite flaws in the course, the main ones being the grading system for the assignments and the lack of a place to go for clarification of the assignment / grading questions.Both the penultimate and the final assignments require a certain amount of extra research and learning beyond what was taught in the lectures and yet the grading instructions for the assignments did not allow for taking that into account; the grading criteria was either binary (grade of 100%, or 0) or had the possibility of a partial passing grade but without listing a number of possible criteria that would put a project into the partial passing grade category.

I'm pleased I took the course - I wouldn't have made such good progress working on my own.
