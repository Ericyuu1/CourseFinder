5405967~COURSE!~rojamqrdEeqpkQ5FbOrePQ,1672004120073,1,0,"This short course is interesting for people who would like to know more about how to calculate VaR and Treynor ratio and practise using a spreadsheet.However, a number of things left me perplexed:1) Unfortunately, the course presenter was not easy to understand at times and the presentation of the concepts/theory was not as slick as I would have hoped/imagined (which was a pity);2) Some of the advice on how to use a spreadsheet for formulae and integrating a reference line in a chart, I would not regard it as best practice;3) The use of the split screen prompting you to use Google Sheet and asking to submit your password to log into a personal Google account was not something I was happy with. The way the course is set up is that someone can do things alongside the instructor only when working on the split screen application. Any attempt to work on an offline version (on Excel) or opening another window automatically stops the video.Overall, I think that the course could benefit from a bit of a refresh as it has loads of potential to be interesting and helpful.",0,0,Laura Leotta,5405967
