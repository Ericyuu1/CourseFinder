56315948~COURSE!~svCB0bflEeiV3hLuYXLyZg,1607498280499,2,0,"If you come here expecting a continuation of the beginner Chinese course by NTU, hop off. This course is far harder than its predecessor. This course provides no English subtitles, which means that you have to write down every single new word you do not understand. If you have the time and energy to do so, go ahead. But I ended up having to google translate the entire course transcript just to make sense of what's going on.The course itself is really good; the professor explains local Taiwanese culture and cities in great, beautiful detail. However, I suggest you learn Chinese on your own for a bit before enrolling. Trust me, the difficulty jump from the beginner's course to this one is rather significant. I might re-enroll in the future, but not until my Chinese is good enough to do so.",0,4,Bianca Geraldine Inez,56315948

If you had a year of Chinese language study, the class will be a fine follow-up class.What isn't mentioned in the course description it that the class is not ""Intermediate Chinese for English-speakers”。 It is an Chinese immersive language class.So, instead of the 5 hours to complete, consider it 30-40 hours as one refers to dictionaries and previous textbooks.I would provide a higher rating had I known this was an immersive class before starting.",0,1,T.J.

The course is also brought differently by having the objects themselves interact or talk or some kind of story, unlike most lectures which almost always includes a set of new words and examples brought by the lecturer. There are still plenty and enough explanation on every new word and the example but mind you, it is delivered in full Chinese without any English explanation (so this is not recommended for beginners but more for someone who knows some Chinese).
