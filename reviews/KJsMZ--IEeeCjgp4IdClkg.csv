1888370~COURSE!~KJsMZ--IEeeCjgp4IdClkg,1557255881137,1,0,"I've come to learn about the only openly atheistic country of note and right off the bat in an introduction an american is trying to redifine religion in order to persuade me that non-religious people don't exist because religion really just means ""structural values"", and that right after pointing out correctly that indeed religion is just one element of broader culture. Perhaps that broader culture might be where ""structural values"" come from instead? Not exactly what I would call trustworthy or worthwhile source of information, but then again, being an atheist I apparently don't even exist, and neither does this review.",0,3,Michał Dampz,1888370

I also noticed that he switches into Mandarin randomly, often with no clear purpose (ie. he'll say the word for ""sincerity"" in Mandarin and then translate it, but doesn't serve to clarify concepts). It's quite distracting, and it made it more difficult to focus.",0,0,Helen Leung,31811460

10562175~COURSE!~KJsMZ--IEeeCjgp4IdClkg,1587824504013,4,0,"I appreciate with sincerity that the material of this course is offered at all. It's not like you have a bunch of choices when you want to learn this particular subject matter in a free, non-credit, online form. For the most part the assigned readings were outstanding. I read the entirety of the text and found answers to things I had considered in the past.The course could be improved in a few ways. First instead of the videos primarily showing the instructor talking with an occasional Power Point slide, something else should be displayed. This could included some things such as maps, pictures of the individuals discussed, time lines, and images of some of the places discussed. It is of little benefit to show someone talking and showing slides of text that is in the transcript. Second, the lectures and quizzes do not do service to the readings. The readings are extensive and detailed. I understand that the class cannot cover everything, but a 10 to 20 minute lecture is maybe covering 20% of the material and the quizzes even less.To be clear I appreciate that this material is offered at all. With a few improvements to presentation this course would be even better.",0,2,Matthew Ramseyer,10562175
9506709~COURSE!~KJsMZ--IEeeCjgp4IdClkg,1547276216087,4,0,"More challenging and advanced than I anticipated.  I recommend this course for those who are already familiar with Chinese culture and history and want to deepen their knowledge. Not as an introduction for beginners.  But if you give it the commitment it requires, you will learn a lot about early Chinese religion.  Take notes, memorize the terms, and watch the videos multiple times.  Then take the quizzes.  If you get a low score, go over the material again.  I give it 4 out of 5 stars because I think the presentation could be better.  Also, if you are interested in Taoism, Buddhism and/or Qigong, be aware that he approaches it as an academic, not a practitioner. I guess that's expected for a course like this. Thanks, Coursera, for making this series on early Chinese religion free.",0,0,Rochelle Shultz,9506709

I could definitely manage with 2 hours a week in addition to the lectures. ",0,0,Alicia Hennig,50614324
3445760~COURSE!~KJsMZ--IEeeCjgp4IdClkg,1587305201156,5,0,"This course was a revelation. I had taken it at CUHK 10 years ago and it stayed with me ever since. I am so grateful that CUHK has decided to share Dr. Lagerwey's course with the world. It is a true eye-opener for those who are interested in China, but have not managed to go past the news, modern cultural propaganda and also mainstream ideas about Chinese history and thought, which mainly derive from a focus on a limited number of elite documents and elite intellectual debates (Confucius, Laozi, court-sponsored historical records, etc.), while disregarding historical context and misrepresenting the major influence that religious discourse has had on Chinese thought and on the organization of Chinese society at all levels, including at the level of the elites. It was also the first time I got information on the importance of popular religion and local communities in China, which delivers a serious blow to the usual top-down views on Chinese history and society. In sum, this course (together with the 3 additional courses presented by Dr. Lagerwey) provides an excellent framework and a slew of textual sources (sometimes confronting them with contradictory archaeological evidence) that allow us to understand how power has been obtained, maintained and consolidated with each paradigm shift, especially at the level of discourse, throughout all of Chinese documented history, since the Shang dynasty to the present day.
