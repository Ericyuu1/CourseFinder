70180991~COURSE!~QKGzLQoYEeWKzSIAC7Uk8A,1675640729152,1,0,"I'm deeply disappointed. It does help to know the types of conflicts, but this could be learned by a simple conflict definition made in two paragraphs. It is poorly scripted: they ramble on a topic even before finishing enumerating the elements that are being explained. That way they don't complete the overview on the topic at hands. It doesn't have actual definitions: by the use of generic words and concepts, things are never actually defined. A lot of times you could use the very same generic concepts but change the meaning of the sentence from positive to negative or otherwise, and provide a different example. This would completely change the ""teaching"" and would be perfectly feasible, because they don't properly explain anything based on further root cause or reasoning. Also, not taking into account human nature. It assumes all people behave in the same way at a given situation or don't even comment that point. I have came accross samples in the deliverables, from people who did in real life situations exactly what was said in examples in the course, and it went all wrong. Finally, the peer-reviewed deliveries are not as clear and well defined as they are in other courses I've previously attended. This leads to poorly defined objectives and difficult peer-review experience.",0,0,Álvaro Martín,70180991

It was tedious to find my way through the course and annoying pop-ups kept interrupting my work. It also wasn't clear from the course's title and description that this course only deals with the conflicts in organizations and can hardly be applied to life in general. The videos were boring and were basically nothing but the instructor talking to the camera and some dramatized scenes that would have been better left out altogether. The cases she presented were for the most part irrelevant and unconvincing. There was very little if any additional materials and sources presented during the course, and I found it all highly confusing and disorganized.
