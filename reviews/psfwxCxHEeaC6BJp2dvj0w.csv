4391169~COURSE!~psfwxCxHEeaC6BJp2dvj0w,1524628293323,1,0,"There is no point in taking this course or registering for the specialisation at all. There is such a heavy backlog of ungraded assignments. I have submitted my assignments on time and received no grades. WIthout this course you cant take the final project course. I don't know how the creators can address the problem of not receiving grades. I have been trying to review extra assignments but I am just 1 person. For now, it is pointless. A waste of money.",0,1,Jane Swingler,4391169

I recommend the courses though, but only if you are patient: it takes really long until there are enough peers to grade and get graded, so you have to reset dates or switch sessions may times.
