78744946~COURSE!~tC04nXtyEee9Jg72MTK0sg,1610724411959,1,0,"The course was very difficult to understand as the standard of English was terrible. Questions on tests weren't made with proper sentences and frequently used the wrong words, diagrams were wrong and misleading. Some of the lecturers had such bad English or heavy accents you had to focus in understanding them rather than what they were trying to teach. Almost all lecturers except the for week 6 over complicated things rather than simplify them for ease of understanding. Overall this was not a particularly good course, when you have (inaudible) in your own transcript because the word used was unintelligible something is seriously wrong.",0,1,Fore Play Crazy Golf ,78744946

I mostly focused on doing the reading portions, but week 5 did not have any - only references to books one could read. Finally, this course focuses solely on production based companies, and I would have liked to see some sections on how businesses int he service industry or non-profits would go about budgeting.

26675886~COURSE!~tC04nXtyEee9Jg72MTK0sg,1590941546625,2,0,"The course is comprehensive and gives an overview of budget planning processes in the case of a manufacturing company. However, I don't think this course is suited for people who have no business or economic background and learning material is of a generally low quality.- Most modules are redundant and repeat the same concepts over and over again, adding little depth and even confusing them- The course is a compendium of theoretical concepts with very few and always decontextualised examples; there are no case studies or practical examples to analyse- Editorially, video and reading resources are poorly curated. Reading resources are almost always close to a simple transcription of video lessons, adding nothing to what the professor already said and providing no chances for further clarification- Transcripts are filled with mistakes, sometimes sentence structure and meaning is unclear and at times even quiz questions are written in a confusing way. Grammar and sense checking would do good next time.I finished the course because I had already invested so much time in it but I would not recommend it and I advise professors to revise teaching approach and content organization.",0,3,Marco Borselli,26675886
43245942~COURSE!~tC04nXtyEee9Jg72MTK0sg,1565812542084,2,0,"I found the instructors nearly impossible to understand. Their scripts really needed a thorough editing from a native English speaker. Some of the quiz questions I managed to guess right but I still have no idea what the question was even asking.Several of the quizzes tested me on material that hadn't yet been covered in the course. For example, there was a question about ROE, and I had no idea what that was. Turns out, the explanation was in the following chapter. I also remember the initial description of ZBB said ""Here are the benefits and downsides of ZBB. We'll tell you what ZBB is in the next lesson."" Why are you quizzing me on something before you explain it?The course was also very vague in critical areas. For example, they mentioned ""business segmenting"" as a crucial step in the budgeting process several times but never explained how we were supposed to segment our business or what that even means.I basically ended up Googling every technical term they used and teaching myself what that meant. This course would have saved me a lot of time if it just said, ""Here is a list of 50 accounting terms and concepts you need to know. Google them and figure out how to use them by yourself.""",0,10,Kacie Wright,43245942

It also provides an insight of budgeting relation to financial reports. The course materials could be improved though as there are many spelling mistakes (e.g. Week 5 and Week 7 materials), sometimes the videos are self-repetitive and too long, the lecturers' English pronunciation is not always easy to understand. Some test questions are vaguely formulated and are confusing. In my opinion, the introduction part could be shorter and the part of income statement (especially the calculations related to current assets) could be better explained.
