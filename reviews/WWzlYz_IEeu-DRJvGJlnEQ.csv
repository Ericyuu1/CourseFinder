14537509~COURSE!~WWzlYz_IEeu-DRJvGJlnEQ,1655831101216,1,0,"I followed along and audited the 1st course assuming that they were going to explain the scripts and concepts they just tell you to use without explaining, this course just adds more concepts and scripts they have created without explaining it, so sure, you can make 2d games if you follow along, but you get minimal comprehension and are unable to apply it outside of this course, really a waste of time",0,1,Ryan Davidson,14537509
60934950~COURSE!~WWzlYz_IEeu-DRJvGJlnEQ,1635184550042,3,0,"Week 1 of this course felt sort of overwhelming, it should be changed to week 3 as it sets the blueprint for Week 4. Also, I felt the instructor for week 1 went too fast when doing the tutorial.  Weeks 2 and 3 dive deep into Game Technology and Storytelling. In my opinion, I think this course should break up the week 1 material and spread it out to the week 2 and week 3 material to make this course more balanced.",0,2,Noah Mathew,60934950
32027212~COURSE!~WWzlYz_IEeu-DRJvGJlnEQ,1631017074617,3,0,"It was fun.  I'm still super annoyed with how peer graded assignments are supposed to be objective, but people will review them subjectively.   With only two peers reviewing something it can affect your grade if someone doesn't find your game ""fun"" or ""it's too hard"", or they just flat out mark your score wrong (like does it include a screen shot?, how does one get that wrong?)There is no way to run that up the ladder and and have someone take a second look.  Very annoying.   Also following the tutorials left me able to repeat some of the actions, but didn't really know the ""why"" behind it.  I had to watch other free youtube videos to get a better understanding, what I found was content that was easier to follow on youtube.",0,1,Joe Zimmerman,32027212

As with the previous course, the project assignment encourages learners to be creative, yet the course does not teach learners enough skills to be creative. Be prepared to find other education materials in order to complete the project - although this is really not a big deal, since any learning is valuable. Keep in mind that you will still need to follow instructions by the same TA though the course's most important content.",0,0,Frank Pan,88288590
