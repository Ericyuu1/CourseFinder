Therefore I was stuck in the course for pushing a repository, and couldn't go forward. I demand a refund for this course since contain wrong and out-of-date information. For the others who want to try this course, my recommendation is 'please don't waste you time and money'.",0,1,Qingfeng Li,7845804
19232793~COURSE!~I40PBt3ZEeqV9QqF9sNyhw,1614314879148,3,0,"I do not recommend taking this type of course, take one and pass it, however after a few days I have tried to review the material, and my surprise is that it asks me to pay again to be able to review the material. Of course coursera gives me a small discount for having already paid it previously.
It is very easy to download the videos and difficult to get hold of the material, but with ingenuity it is possible. Then I recommend uploading them to YouTube and keeping them private for when they want to consult (they avoid legal problems and can share with friends), then they can request a refund.
