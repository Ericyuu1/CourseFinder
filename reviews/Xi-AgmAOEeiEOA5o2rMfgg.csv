The instructor has just put up a bunch of slides, does a poor job narrating those slides, and seems to have little background in statistics. The sample size website that he promotes is poorly designed. The intro lecture describing the course is obnoxious, and contain question prompts that have nothing to do with what is being said. I don't understand why Coursera has allowed something like this on their site.",0,2,jl b,26215950
53662485~COURSE!~Xi-AgmAOEeiEOA5o2rMfgg,1623413118664,3,0,"I have mixed feelings about the quality of this course. It was without a doubt the least well organised course of all the Coursera courses I have done. The content is relevant and there is enough to learn, but you have to accept that the forums don't work, there are hardly any participants, lecturers don't respond and the presentation of lessons is outdated. It took 3 weeks after submitting the last assignments befor I received my grades. This content deserves a major update.",0,1,Stephan Ramaekers,53662485
