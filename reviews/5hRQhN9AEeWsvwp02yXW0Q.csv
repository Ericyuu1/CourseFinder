2428108~COURSE!~5hRQhN9AEeWsvwp02yXW0Q,1502821352615,3,0,"Although certain aspects of it were positive and in line with the quality of previous modules, this course had its problems. The biggest was the lack of alignment between weeks 4 and 5 (which would be better placed in Module 2) and the rest of it. It got worse due to the lack of Stepik support and material in the textbooks that would in theory accompany the course. This misalignment is also evident when we look at the quizzes and the final challenge, which hardly tackled the material of those two dreadful weeks. ",0,0,Hercules Pereira Neves,2428108

It would be better if the presentation material was bigger and the facilitator images smaller - you need only see a face, not the whole upper body in the foreground.Nevertheless, I have been enlightened !",0,0,Bryan Griffiths,18723448
