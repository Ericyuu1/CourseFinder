Firstly, the course did not seem well balanced meaning that some weeks--particularly week 2--had A LOT of materials to watch and really felt like it was two weeks crammed into one, and then other weeks barely had anything.  Secondly, the exercises seemed unclear, poorly thought out and not really helpful.  There were many errata that really should have been fixed in the beta iterations of this course.Thirdly, I really would like to see more application and less discussion of implementing algorithms. Fourthly, the ""scaling"" section was also a major disappointment.  While it is mildly interesting to learn about stochastic gradient descent, I think it would have been more interesting to have a discussion about how classifiers work in a parallelized computing environment or actually to try one out using Spark. Finally, given that GraphLab/Dato/Turi was just acquired by Apple, I question whether it is worthwhile to take this course as ALL the materials are taught using a library that in all likelihood will cease to exist.

2630786~COURSE!~3c1bSkIJEeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,1560441170028,2,0,"First, coursera is a ghost town.  There is no activity on the forum.  Real responses stopped a year ago. Most of the activity is from 3 years ago. This course is dead.Two, this course seems to approach the topic as teaching inadequate ways to perform various tasks to show the inadequacies. You can learn from that; we will make mistakes or use approaches that are less than ideal.  But, that should be a quick ""don't do this,"" while moving on to better approachesThree, the professors seem to dismiss batch learning as a ""dodgy"" technique.  If Hinton, Bengio, and other intellectual leaders of the field recommend it as the preferred technique, then it probably is.Four, the professors emphasize log likelihood. Mathematically, minus the log likelihood is the same as cross-entropy cost. The latter is more robust and applicable to nearly every classification problem (except decision trees), and so is a more versatile formulation. As neither actually plays any roll in the training algorithm except as guidance for the gradient and epsilon formulas and as a diagnostic, the more versatile and robust approach should be preferred.The professors seem very focused on decision trees.  Despite the ""apparent"" intuitive appeal and computational tractability, the technique seems to be eclipsed by other methods.  Worth teaching and occasionally using to be sure, but not for 3/4 of the course.There are many mechanical problems that remain in the material.  At least 6 errors in formulas or instructions remain.  Most can be searched for on the forum to find some resolution, through a lot of noise. Since the last corrections were made 3 years ago, the UW or Coursera's lack of interest shows.It was a bit unnecessary to use a huge dataset that resulted in a training matrix or over 10 billion cells.  Sure, if you wanted to focus on methods for scaling--very valuable indeed--go for it.  But, this lead to unnecessary long training times and data issues that were, at best, orthogonal to the overall purpose of highlighting classification techniques and encouraging good insights about how classification techniques work.The best thing about the course was the willingness to allow various technologies to be used.  The developers went to some lengths to make this possible.  It was far more work to stray outside the velvet ropes of the Jupiter notebooks, but it was very rewarding.Finally, the quizzes were dependent on numerical point answers that could often be matched only by using the same exact technology and somewhat sloppy approaches (no lowercase for word sentiment analysis, etc.).  It does take some cleverness to think of questions that lead to the right answer if the concepts are implemented properly.  It doesn't count when the answers rely precisely on anomalies.I learned a lot, but only because I wrote my own code and was able to think more clearly about it, but that was somewhat of a side effect.All in all, a disappointing somewhat out of date class.",0,8,Lewis C.

I'm surprised at how intuitive the idea of boosting really is. Also interesting that random forests are dismissed as not as powerful as boosting, but I would love to know why! Both methods appear to expose more data to the learner, and a heuristic comparison between RF and boosting would have been greatly appreciated.One can immediately notice the difference between statistician Emily, who took us through the mathematical derivation of the derivative (ha.ha.) function for linear regression (much appreciated Emily!), and computer scientist Carlos, who skipped this bit for logistic regression but provided lots of verbose code to track the running of algorithms during assignments (helps to see what is actually happening under the hood).

Carlos takes a more practical approach by showing how things are related using pictures, trial and error, what happens when we do this vs. that.  Emily on the other hand dives down into the math and actual facts.  I feel Emily is more difficult overall - but once I got through it, I had a better foundation and intuition as to how things work and better overall understanding.  So - giving this class 4 stars as compared to Emily's class that is 5 stars.  I feel if they would mix it with Emily doing the math immediately followed by Carlos explanations it would be best.

This Machine Learning class and the rest of the Machine Learning series from the University of Washington is the best material on the subject matter. What really sets this course and series apart is the case-base methodology as well as in-depth technical subject matter. Specifically, the step through coding of the algorithms provides key insight that is seriously missed in other classes even in traditional academic settings.
