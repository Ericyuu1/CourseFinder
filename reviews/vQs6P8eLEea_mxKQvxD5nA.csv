The didactics are not so helpful, though:-​ The video visuals mostly consist of stock photographs, some headings, and the occasional first page of some paper. So the visuals are mostly decorative and do not contain much helpful content. There are no slides for download and for review after the course. This makes studying for the quizzes really hard.-​ The officially required reading are 50-100 pages of papers per week. This is too much (compared to what is checked in the quizzes), and also not a good format to use for studying for the quizzes.-​ The quizzes often use negated questions (""Which of the following is NOT an example of …""), which is completely irrelevant for checking whether the student has understood the material, but it increases the chances of getting the answer wrong by accident.-​ The feedback to the incorrectly answered quiz questions only shows which questions the student got wrong, but not which option was wrong and which would have been correct. This is very unhelpful for reading the feedback and learning from it.A​ll in all, not a good course for learning about this topic. The time would be better spend reading the recommended book. (And I really would have expected a professor of psychology to exhibit better didactic skills. After all, how learning works and what a teacher can do to support this is part of the field of psychology.)",0,1,Oliver Klee,98552703

And, because you didn't submit them, the course doesn't think you have completed the module. It essentially kicked me out.Unfortunately, I had work that kept me away for a week when I was on the last module. The system had me re-enroll in a new course because my group had moved on. All fine. Then it would not let me start back where I left off even though it still showed me as completing those modules. The problem was that I did not pay for the quizzes- I'm auditing the course.Which also pissed me off because Each time I did the quizzes and came to that button where it would not let me submit my answers- well, aggravating. They should tell you in advance so you don't waste your time. The quizzes are hard and I still went through them but didn't bother to mark answers after a while.So now I'm unable to advance to the last module where I left off, effectively ending the course for me.And, add to that, even though the Coursera claims to have a chat function- there are no phone numbers or email addresses you can use to contact as a student-the place where they tell you to go chat with someone is just Help Articles.So: Course Good, Coursera Bad, but-Having taken many Coursera classes, this is the first one where I was so completely screwed.

44280366~COURSE!~vQs6P8eLEea_mxKQvxD5nA,1627799985533,4,0,"I've just stuck to the videos because the readings are inaccessible at my level. I wish that in the videos, instead of distracting imagery, dot points backing up the narration were used. Whenever studies were used to support the claims in the videos, graphs were shown of the data. I am in week 4 and still have not seen a graph that I could decipher. This has resulted in me having to lean heavily on the lecturer's decription of the results, in order to understand to material. If the graphs had more accessible language in the indices and the lecturer spent some time explaining to how to read each graph (pointing for instance) while speaking about the results, then I could perhaps understand them and maybe be able to make up my own mind about the findings, instead of having to kind of just take them on blind faith or square them with my reality by leaning heavily on introspection into my own experience. Having made all these criticisms I still think this course is totally worth it. I'm finding that I'm learning more about studies that I've heard of years ago in managment podcasts, and I'm pleased to be developing a firmer foundation on these topics that I've been interested in for such a long time. Although SDT maybe just a bunch of theory, I am finding that the way that it conceptualises human behaviour and motivation is meshing really well with what I'm learned in life and work so far, and I'm glad of having this framework to work with, going forward, and excited to see how the field of neuropsychology use it. Furthermore I've discovered some great relevance of this theory to my personal life as a person with ADHD, and am excited to try some of the ideas its given me in my own life, and even share them if I feel they work. If you take this theory seriously and think deeply on it, you'll find more and more questions come up for you as to the implications of the facts it would seem to reveal. If you find grappling with the questions of human motivation exciting, I'm sure you will enjoy this course. ",0,2,Alex Wilder,44280366

You could learn the theory in a very systematic way, and you'll certainly gain the deep and insightful knowledge about the theory literally from theory to practice. Only thing I'd like to change is that the amount of reading and the required time do not match well, and the content of non-required reading would appear on the test. As an assiduous learner, I am very grateful to read more and it is a helpful that there are many additional readings provided. However, because of time constrains sometimes I have to choose what to read and organise my study, which leads me not to read some articles. It would be much greater if additional reading allocations are more organised, and at least only the content of required readings should be on the test. ",0,16,Yusei Ando,17453977

I just completed a paper entitled 'SDT and The Marginalized' and spent 100+ hours in research. I was most recently Managing Director of a large wealth mgmt firm before my diagnosis of a TBI. This added to my 1988 diagnosis of Bipolar 1 Disorder. These issues resulted in incarceration in 2002 and homelessness in 2010. When I was recently introduced to SDT in a Gen Psych course, it immediately resonated with me as to EXACTLY why I have been resilient- my 3 Psychological Needs have been met primarily in an autonomous presentation. This course is a expansive introduction to SDT and the areas of research that have provided consistent results in so many areas of life.

This collection of theories is well thought out and does not add unnecessary variables to jazz itself up. Most impressive are the multitude of applications to which it is relevant. It is a privellege to learn about this theory from Dr Richard Ryan, the confidence he has in the material he is teaching certainly makes the theory all the more convincing. I highly recommend this course to anyone who is studying or just interested in human behaviour. It certainly has kicked the legs out of under some of the most widely accepted ideas promoted by Behaviourists!",0,2,Dominic Agha-Rafei,41784781
