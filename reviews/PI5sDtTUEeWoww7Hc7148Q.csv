I don't know Superheros, so a lot of that made no sense to me and was not relatable to learn what that meant. I happen to be the same type as Toni so that alone helped me understand much of what she was saying. I had to do a lot of offline research to figure out what the classes were supposed to teach.There are a lot of errors and technical glitches in this course. Every recording is a different volume. Toni has a soft voice to begin with so turning it all the way up made it garbled, and sometimes I had to turn it all the way down. The typed downloadable correspondence which goes with the videos was often translated incorrectly, and I was left trying to hear what Toni was saying, while trying to interpret what the typing was trying to say using the wrong words. Grading assignments was another issue. I received a Greek typeface for one assignment, which I could not copy and paste into Google Translate. I could not grade another language, so I kept trying to find a new assignment and the program kept giving it to me over and over again. I finally had to log out completely, start over, finally received a new one to grade, and then it sent it to me again! I am guessing that poor person never got anyone to grader the assignment. So many of the links to follow did not exist and I could not search for anything similar to replace it. Stealing links from other peoples websites is not useful when the site changes, or catches on to you and blocks you, like has happened here. Maybe ask permission for documents or pick better more comprehensive assignments and writings you create yourself?The final assignment to set up a quiz and interview people to do a 360 interview does not really work in this format. There is not really enough time to do so properly in one week and it is impossible to do so in  less than a week, or for people who can only take the course on the weekends. If I had known at the beginning I could skip all the way  ahead by just watching some videos, and get started early I may have attempted it. Unfortunately, It was also not appropriate until the 3rd week due to what we were learning in week two. We were not far enough ahead to know what we needed to know. I also wish week one was more comprehensive and had better research links. Most were broken.All in all, the course felt sloppy, hurried, and incomplete by Coursera and maybe secondarily Toni. I know Toni meant well, and I applaud her for teaching a subject that is really hard to do; focusing inward, and observing outward. Most of my student graded papers showed me that my classmates just could not do it. I commend Toni on teaching an all inclusive class that showed no personality traits were bad or good, and that each can enhance a team or friendship. Bravo.",0,2,Amy Harper,77001817
75139378~COURSE!~PI5sDtTUEeWoww7Hc7148Q,1608573238676,3,0,"I feel like the course itself is great but the assignments are a bit too much. You can't be vague because the grading criteria is super strict. So, if they ask you for your salary and you don't say how much it is, you'll get 0 points from your peers. They ask you to write down your team or companies goals and if you're vague, you'll get 0 points. But what is not understood by the people who set up the assignments is that if you have a very rare name and you explain your companies-teams goals so detailed, it's very easy to find out who this person is and where they work and what are the goals for the team. See how its an security threat? Also, in the course we were shown different personality types and as a fun thing, different superheros, Disney princesses etc were shown that are the same personality type as you are. And there was an assignment where you had to explain pretty much in depth about a superhero in your personality type which ASSUMES you know all the superheros. And if I did the assignment with a Disney princess cuz I didn't know the superheros (or, any superheros tbh) my peers gave me 0 points so I had to resubmit the assignment. So, the way the assignments are built up are not good. I'd highly recommend going over that so that people wouldn't literally be giving away their company goals and that if one doesn't know about superheros, they can still pass the course ;) Some assignments are very old as well - like approach to your boss with a monologue why you deserve a raise. I feel like thats very corporate and in the world of start ups you'd never need to have a convo like that in those details and explain your five (5!!!!) year goals in the company...

Team members should take the survey at least twice in the beginning and then again, once a year, before their annual review. Interpreters (supervisors) should never use MB until they become certified and verified practitioners of Myers-Briggs. Untrained and those with minimal knowledge of how MB is interpreted could lead to problems. I also wonder why MB doesn't have a way to identify the naysayers, luddites, ""yes but"", anti-everything, negative team members. To some, MB sounds too goodie goodie. We all know that there are always negative, envious, jealous, lazy, unhappy and resentful employees and all the 16 Types are missing something. Just Saying!
