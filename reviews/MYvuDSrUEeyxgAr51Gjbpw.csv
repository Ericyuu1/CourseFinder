82173761~COURSE!~MYvuDSrUEeyxgAr51Gjbpw,1652691102447,4,0,"There is a lot of great information in this set of courses. It is a really good intro to DeFi. It is not, however, a terribly balanced view of DeFi vs CeFi despite the instructors attempts to do so. For example, the assurance that DeFi front-running is OK because the information is public completely misses the point. Front running is forbidden by the SEC because of the harm it does to clients, not just because it is inside information. https://www.sec.gov/rules/other/f4-433/mccann1.htm
There are many examples of this throughout all 4 courses but the front-running point is made time and again.

Conclusion - this is a good set of courses to learn the basics about DeFi but beware that it is a wholeheartedly pro-DeFi slant.",0,0,Darren Gilbert,82173761

1884567~COURSE!~MYvuDSrUEeyxgAr51Gjbpw,1664989098940,5,0,"​I became interested in DeFi after hearing an interview with Prof. Harvey on a podcast.  I bought the book but struggled to really ""get it"" just from reading.  The book is great, well-written, no fluff, but I needed more background. T​his course supplied that background and more.  The discussion of technology and cryptography was at the right level for my needs, and was well-balanced with the discussions of current protocols and their potential uses.  The risk module was very clear on what could go wrong.  The white papers or articles noted on the slides are well worth reading.  If you take the quizzes, be sure to read through the detailed answers, even if you pass with 100%!  The detailed answers were very informative and helped cement the key concepts. Prof. Harvey's enthusiasm for this topic is very evident and motivating.  A​fter taking this course, I note that when I read articles, newsletters, or blogs about Crypto or DeFi, I have a much deeper understanding of what the authors are saying.  Before the course such discussions were quite opaque to me. Ideas for improvement, or perhaps for a next course, would be more examples of real-world use of the DeFi protocols.  More focus on how the protocols are accomplishing (or could accomplish) greater economic activity. F​inally, at the end of one module in the 4th course, Prof. Harvey states ""This is not your last DeFi course"", emphasizing the need for ongoing education in this topic.  I hope we'll see some of that on Coursera. ",0,0,James Harrington,1884567

I do hope that changes happen in our lifetimes, as they are essential to end bloated and cartelised net interest margins, oligarchic dispensations and injustices  which such systems encourage. Even if DeFi acts as a catalyst of change for these legacy systems , its work would have been half accomplished. But DeFi itself would have to overcome its own deficiencies such as energy guzzling systems, the tortoise paced transactions etc. to even think of making a dent.

76838412~COURSE!~MYvuDSrUEeyxgAr51Gjbpw,1645907623823,5,0,"Wow! This entire learning experience, as Professor Harvey describes it, provides an excellent foundation for knowing what the main elements of the DeFi space currently are as of 2021 when the courses were produced. He is engaging to listen to and is deeply versed in the subject matter. I gained the confidence to at least begin to know the right questions when evaluating a DeFi project and to better assess the quality of additional online resources for continued learning. Previously I've been down too many random rabbit holes ultimately ferreting out useless info. This course provides accurate, reliable information and provides a framework for where to start in the DeFi world, rather than running helter-skelter here and yonder trying to figure out how to get a handle on what the heck is going on here. I'm grateful to have a better plan on how to approach my crypto investing even though the course is truly NOT a course about investing. But it is, among other things, a course about learning the primary mechanics of how DeFi currently works in a few of the major protocols. Before these four courses, I didn't even understand basic stuff like how liquidity works in Uniswap for example. And, who knew—as I was oohing and aahing to myself going through these courses about how cool it all was—many DeFi projects have been around beginning about seven years ago and growing and morphing by leaps and bounds in that time. I thought they were much more recent and only a couple of them. I also learned many things about traditional centralized finance because I looked up everything he mentioned I didn't yet know how it worked, like yield curves, derivatives, and futures contracts. (Finance is obviously not my background.) For me, making sure I understood traditional finance concepts made a big difference in understanding decentralized finance as presented here. Blockchain and cryptography concepts were well presented. Professor Harvey discusses them with ease, clarity, and fluency. Even though I have an IT background, it wouldn't matter if I didn't due to his charming and clear instruction. Thank you, Professor Harvey!!",0,1,Carol Whaley Addassi,76838412

Professor Harvey does an excellent job explaining many nuances to DeFi. He uses a combination of powerpoint, visuals, analogies and case studies to make the content understandable. The professor teaches with clarity, and passion yet treats the subject fairly offering alternative points of view about the opportunities and risks of DeFi as compared to the current financial system. I have been introduced to the cryptocurrency and DeFi space a little over 6 months ago. Since that time, I have ""fallen down the rabbit hole"" so to speak and cannot learn enough about it. These courses provide a strong foundation to explore further for personal investing, and or a career in the space. Unlike the other courses I took on Coursera related to blockchain and cryptocurriencies (which were also pretty good), these courses felt much more up to date than the others. Being up to date in this space is essential because one year is like 10 years of another field in terms of innovation and how fast the landscape changes. Specific to this course, it was really helpful to understand a broad overview of the opportunities and risks involved in the DeFi space both as an individual and as a society. I really appreciated the passionate call the action at the end of the course. Though I am watching the course through a screen it felt very authentic and inspiring. I am sure many people will be positively impacted as a result of this course being made available online. ",0,3,Mike Morabito,16988301
