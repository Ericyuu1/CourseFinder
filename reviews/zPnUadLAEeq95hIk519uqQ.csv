If you are fluent with PyTorch - you will be fine. If, like me, you're only familiar with Tensorflow or other ML libraries - it might be a struggle.The course itself provides next to none code explanations. A  lot of practical assignments end up becoming excercises in reverse-engineering their testing code. Reading through all the questions on Slack, I am far from alone in this. Some code cells give you tasks along the lines of ""you gotta do this, there are a lot of ways to do it, so do it somehow"".Bottom line. Was the course useful? Yeah, I will implement things I learned here in my GANs. Was it a pleasant learning experience? No, it was frustrating due to a glaring lack of code explanations.All it would take to make it much, much better - have an extra video per week which would go over putting the new theory into code, like many other courses here do.",0,2,Nikita Kozhemyakin,36316531

This is really really important to the workings of a GAN, but we never touched the training loop after the first assignment in course 1. I feel like we should have spent more time nailing that training loop down. Also, I don't think any of the classes mentioned the importance of the fact that the cost function is learned, rather than explicit. That's huge!

The course is highly recommended for professionals who have limited time to keep up with the state-of-the-art in GANs. I feel that the course has given me enough knowledge for me to find ways to apply these skills for good in the industry.Areas for possible improvement: 1. Some of the lab exercises put focus on the wrong areas. In some cases, I feel like I was spending time on tensor manipulation instead of learning the important nuances of the algorithms. 2. I would love to see the course extended. It's relatively short and I think some of the advanced optional content could be incorporated into the standard curriculum. What I value most from this course is how it condenses and simplifies concepts. The optional content leaves the reader to self study and doesn't help with accelerating learning.

After completing it I definitely have a much better view of GANs, their architectures, successes and limitations, and have a solid background to tackle reading papers and implementing them on my own. Thank you for making this specialization!With all the positives (which is why I rate it 5/5) there are in my opinion things that can be improved. Especially I think there is too much hand holding for the labs, out of 100 rows of codes I code maybe 2-3%. Many of these don't give much value coding but I want to feel like I did it! Unfortunately now I am left guessing if I have truly mastered the material (and I'm quite sure I haven't, so I will need to re-implement these on my own). Also since you state that calculus and linear algebra are prerequisites then stick with it! You are trying to be too inclusive and there are several part of the courses where I thought it was entirely unecessary because everyone taken Calc and Linalg already has this knowledge. I would prefer instead if you spend this time making other videos where you go in more depth, perhaps going through some of the difficult math etc. Hopefully you try to improve this for future courses done by deeplearning.ai",0,0,Aladdin Persson,31630173
