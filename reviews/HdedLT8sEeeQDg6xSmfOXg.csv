60608831~COURSE!~HdedLT8sEeeQDg6xSmfOXg,1594204883428,1,0,It is too complicated and time consuming. especially the peer reviewed assignments. this course is ok for young students not for academicians. I wish to discontinue the course.,0,0,SUJA M K,60608831
44803638~COURSE!~HdedLT8sEeeQDg6xSmfOXg,1590662691024,1,0,"I have done different courses on Coursera but this course has worst management as peer assignment is not monitored by anyone in Coursera and people are just putting random assessment which has no like to learning outcome of this course and due to least attendees, you have to access and tolerate circus. My advice would be to attend the courses which have a good number of participants and better grading to attend to the pool of mindful people.  ",0,1,Gyanendra Tewatia,44803638

85369195~COURSE!~HdedLT8sEeeQDg6xSmfOXg,1629121255478,2,0,"I‚Äã found most of the information interesting and applicable. On the other hand, the material was non-sequential and felt disjointed. Each section had little to do with the previous and it seemed more like a collection of lectures rather than a well-rounded certificate program to introduce the learner to the title topic. Also, the format for submitting work was confusing and was (unnecessarily) linked to another site that made it complicated in reviewing work. And speaking of grading, too often there were not enough peers to review work. This require that sections could not be completed when the learner wanted to put in the time to do the work. Expect to return to this course outside of anticipated times or be ok with moving on to other sections without assurance of completion. Case in point: I finished all of my submitted work on a Thursday but did not receive my completed certificate until the next Monday. On the other hand, it is a short course and can be completed quicker than other certiciates I've worked on. ",0,0,Joe Carr,85369195

I keep redefining my deadlines so I can accomplish the peer reviewed tasks, and the weeks pass and no one reads it.
