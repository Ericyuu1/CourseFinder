27488083~COURSE!~lXx7YJPdEeqaOxJg-UKu6Q,1654955053822,1,0,"The Power Electronics specialisation comprises 4 courses at University of Colorado Boulder taught by Prof. Robert Erickson. I paid for the course and also the book ""Fundamental of Power Electronics"" by Prof Erickson and Prof Maksimović. The book is much more comprehensive than the course.
The video and slides of the courses can also be found several times on youtube and other places on the internet. I booked the course and my expectation was that as a paying client I would have a better learning experience.

Prof Erickson is a very good teacher and lecturer. I like the way he presents his slides and adds annotations with the Pencil. He seems to have started  with MOOCs about 2013 and some of the slides are still have this timestamp. 
The content of the first course made me enthusiastic because it includes a hands-on introduction to LTSpice. In the following weeks, however, my enthusiasm waned somewhat. I'm interested in doing some practical work but also in the phenomenological understanding but not in setting up long formulas or calculating values in long formulas. But that's exactly what 2/3 of the knowledge is taught. And the exercises, which cost me twice as much time as the lecture, only consist of determining formulas or values. The last, course 4 week 4,  exercise is finally only at high school level: finding the right formula from one of the slides and entering values. I would have expected more. Btw, the questions in the homework usually build on each other. This means that if you don't understand one of the first questions and can't find the answer, you can't answer the rest either. So you never get the necessary 70%. So you have to be creative because there is no help. In general, I sometimes took advantage of the fact that you can do the exercise as often as you like and simply tried out all the multiple-choice questions. You can also score a point or two by guessing. I would much rather have discussed my comprehension problems with the professor or a tutor or with fellow students. 
For me, who graduated from university 30 years ago, formulating problems, discussing them and helping others with their comprehension problems is the essential skill that a university should teach and that enable graduates to work in the industry as part of a team. Therefore, I find it very annoying that the learning community is non-existent but also that neither Prof. Erickson nor a tutor answers questions. In future, I will simply read text books.

But maybe my expectations were just wrong. After all, the Coursera certificate for the 4 courses cost me about 180USD, while the same courses in the UC Boulder online programme cost 2668USD.",0,0,Martin Musiol,27488083
