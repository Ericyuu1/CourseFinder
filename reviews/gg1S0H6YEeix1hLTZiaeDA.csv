The layout of the curriculum is backwards; already in week 1 the students are given a hefty amount of rather complex programming assignments that are not in the least aligned with what's being taught in the syllabus at the moment. Most of the solutions and tools for completing the programming assignments in week 1 are not presented until week 2-3. If you're lucky you can find some pinpoints in the discussion forum (where old students are equally as tired and frustrated) and pass the assignments simply through trial and error. Not at all an efficient learning strategy.  Also, the technical issues with Sleuth need to be fixed, asap. There are a handful of students who cannot raise their grade to 100% since Sleuth app is bugging and won't accept the final assignment(s). The app is supposed to reset itself after x amount of incorrect uploads - which it doesn't. NO ONE from staff or technical pays any attention to this - although the bug is frequently mentioned in the forum. No student's interested in paying another month's Coursera fee just IN CASE staff at school decides to finally answer in the discussion forum. The lack of mentorship and advise being given in the forum is waaaay below acceptable. Sleuth assignments need to be split into three units and presented at the end of each week, based on that week's curriculum. Your final grade should be calculated as the sum of all quizzes and assignments - after the last week's assignment is done. You're not supposed to be able to download your certificate in week 1 - just because you've guessed your way through all queestions. Someone needs to correct the layout of this course.

It is really exciting to learn something new with web technology and I found the programming exercises quite interesting and useful. Please note that I am an experienced programmer who wanted to learn javascript and true beginners may have a different opinion. There were a few issues with the course that I think need to be addressed on the course material which I list below: 1​) I am using LINUX MINT 20.2 on my computer and the software used for coding in the course, Brackets, is now unsupported. I have tried downloading it from the MINT software manager app, but only the FLATPAK version was available and it doesn't work with live preview. I have then downloaded the package linked in the course page (should have done this from the start), but unfortunately the installation does not work because it requires libcurl3 while Mint 20.2 comes with the newer libcurl4. It is not possible/desirable to downgrade the library, but it is fully compatible, so I had to update the package dependencies to accept the new library. This is not easy nor something someone starting on computing would know, so I think it should be described in the course page. This link provides instructions on how to do it: https://github.com/adobe/brackets/issues/147862​) The course assignement  (sleuth) is described on week 1, when the student still didn't learn all that he needs to solve the assignment. There is also no information that the required knowledge will be obtained throughout the course. So, I have spent countless hours researching on the Internet which led me to finish the assignment and then I realized the material I had researched was part of the course. Not only that, once you finish the assignment, the course is deemed complete, even though we haven't yet seen most of the material. Maybe this is a limitation of Coursera's system, but information should be provided that students should be completing the assignment later in the course, with each lesson/case tied to a different topic. Also, information should be provided to the student when he should try to resolve a case level, based on having gone through the required learning. Another aspect of this problem is that the assignment is supposed to be finished at the end of week 1, when in reality, it should be finished at the end of week 3. 3​) The LINUX version of brackets has an experimental live preview mode that works with Firefox and I used it throughout the entire course. However, it doesnt work for one of the Sleuth cases, so I had to revert to Chrome. But the course does indicate that Chrome is the preferred choice, so that is fine.

For those who never coded before, I would suggest searching some more additional materials in the internet to assist you (at least for me this helped). A positive thing that made me enjoy the course was the methodology applied throughout the classes. You will have a video lecture, and a quiz or exercise after it. I believe this helps you practice straight way what you just learned instead of having tons and tons of new content and then trying to remember  everything in a final test/assignment. Negative points: I like challenges and enjoyed the Sleuth & Co. assignment however, it did not make any sense to be applied in the week 1. If you complete the task, the course is considered completed. I am still on week three and I have the certificate with a grade I know I could have obtained higher if I had  been able to continue. Some of the content were not explained so in case you try it, be aware you will need to search more examples, definitions about variables,  queries, etc in order to be able to complete the cases.

While I feel like what I learned is probably very basic I also feel like I've learned a great deal and am eager to learn more. I do feel like the teacher support could have been a little better but they do give you the tools to find out all the answers you need by yourself. It's just when you're truly stuck you can feel a little helpless. It also says that you should complete the Sleuth assignment in week 1 however you don't learn the things necessary to complete it until weeks 2 and 3. If you are thinking of taking this course definitely make a https://stackoverflow.com/ account and post your questions there as well.
