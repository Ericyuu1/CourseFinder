The three courses escalate smoothly from an introduction to the structure and institutions of the EU, to business transactions in Europe and finally, in this course, to the fundamental issues arising when competition comes into play. The course is well structured, with adequate and sufficient supportive material, for those who want to get a really deep insight in the matters mentioned. What's more, the interviews at the end of each module are a pleasant summary of the information disseminated in the module. Lund University, as far as these three courses of European Business Law that I have attended, has done a great job. As proof, the tests at the end of each module are easy to pass but only for those who have watched the videos and done all the preparation. That is for me, valuable new information but also well corresponding to the examination required. Looking forward for more courses like this one!",0,0,Kyriaki- Marina Platsa,2987584
