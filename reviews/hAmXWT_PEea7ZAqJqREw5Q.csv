The way it is taught, having speakers. I am not sure what it is about this class, but.. it feels maybe not structured. Like I cannot follow where it is going? What is the point? You have people tell about their work and I could not get into that at all. I just cannot put my finger on it! I was hoping to walk away knowing the leaders (mentors) and how they do it. In a clear and concise method. I doubt I am going to finish this class.  Watch HOW TO CHANGE THE WORLD. I think that is the skeleton for how to teach well. ",0,1,SNOW WINTER,27295581

Some of the main lectures were a bit scattered and difficult to follow.  Also the subtitling and notes on the various videos were poorly done, often leaving out the most important words and replacing them with : [foreign].  At one point the coursera subtitles, which was just the word foreign, obscured the video subtitles so that I couldn’t read them.",0,0,Rebecca Niblett,82483597

Pedro was an insightful and generous interviewer. The honours assessments were interesting and challenging and took me out of my comfort zone, in a good way. BUT it feels like it has become a set and forget project for the instructors. The transcriptions are often inaccurate or missing sections, the audio occasionally bad, and many of the links with a 404 feeling that you've landed somewhere that once was, but no longer is. The promised network of collaboration is not easily accessible and disappointingly the forums posts are a little like having a ships in the night greetings with not much follow up. Really could use active moderation and better archiving of projects to draw on for inspiration. ",0,0,Selina Springett,61102911
