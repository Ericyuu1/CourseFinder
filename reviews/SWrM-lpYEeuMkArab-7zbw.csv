108652842~COURSE!~SWrM-lpYEeuMkArab-7zbw,1665236215944,1,0,T​his course is plagued with technical difficulties. The material is fine and the teaching is fine but the final lab took like three weeks to complete because of connectivity issues with the Mongo database and timeout issues. Plus the instructions are confusing. Most of the comments on this lab are about this and to pass it you have to access the database through a different lab. ,0,0,Yevgenia Casale,108652842

The final exam really requires thinking and searching which makes the exam worth.The  developement studio is super slow, it is impossible to work directly in it.The presentation of the noSQL database could be clearer. I found better videos (and shorter) on youtube.I do not think it is necessary to advertise so much for IBM Cloudant. We already pay for the course, it should be add free.",0,2,Matthieu Goulay,90236728

Fortunately, this course offers an excellent introduction to three different NoSQL document databases: MongoDB, Apache Cassandra, and IBM Cloudant.
