It would be improved if copies of the lecture slides for lectures 3-5 were provided, along with solutions for Homework 1.",0,0,Michael Entwisle,51120300
32183980~COURSE!~Q0RJYxVsEeiN0RKIcpSsyg,1590505555309,4,0,"The course is fantastic and is in the heart of quantum technologies as the lecturer mentioned. The lectures structure is consistent. I think that the only draw back is the homework not being challenging enough. I also see that the infinite number of attempting the problems is an obstacle to careful thinking before submitting. Overall, I recommend this course to any one desiring to understand quantum optics and related fields. Simply, this is a great course to begin with. ",0,0,Abanoub Maher Semry Mikhail,32183980
118558262~COURSE!~Q0RJYxVsEeiN0RKIcpSsyg,1675868183893,5,0,"I like the courses (Quantum Optics 1 and 2). There are many concept and application of quantum optics that is very good for someone want to work in quantum science and technology. Beside the course sections, you will learn from a teacher that is one of the best quantum optics leader in world, as you can see his Nobel prize! He knows  how to teach complicate concept in simple way at each step. I recomend the course, it helps you to extend your knowledge in quantum optics frontier. I wish  all the best for Prof. Aspect and his team.",0,0,Mohammad Khalili,118558262

Dr. Aspect is charming and knowledgable - skilled at getting across tough concepts.  The class is not easy, but it is not punishing unnecessarily either.  I'll admit that it was good to spend time watching videos through a couple of times instead of working on long homeworks like in QO I.  I need to understand where the math comes from in my job, but I am not doing it regularly myself, and so I'd be spending a lot of time on something I would forget pretty quickly.  But I like that the classes give you plenty of opportunity to do all the work through, but are also accessible if you don't. I am honestly sad to be done with these for now and can't wait for the third one.",0,1,Amber Ulbrich,59344541
