646425~COURSE!~EGOMPEacEeWcUBKKSpC5MQ,1504678050347,4,0,The topic and milestone-based schedule are great; you are free to take many decisions but still get enough guidance to avoid straying away from the project goal. Instructor and student commitment is a bit low; there is very little feedback in the forums and submissions are sometimes so shallow that add little value to the reviewer.,0,0,Roberto Santamaria,646425
