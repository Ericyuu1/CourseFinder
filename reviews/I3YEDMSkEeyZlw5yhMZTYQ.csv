39910695~COURSE!~I3YEDMSkEeyZlw5yhMZTYQ,1668322777629,3,0,"An interesting course offering a wide knowledge of PIE and indo european languages.  Dr Pronk's presentations in particular are very good. However, unless I am wrong, reporting an issue under the  course material seems not to work perfectly. I reported a number of inaccuracies in presentations of Greek grammar and never received a reply, see for example in Week 3, the video on Greek cases. Furthermore some ancient Greek words indicated in the course seemed sometimes quite incomprehensible to me, I would have liked to discuss them with teaching staff, but unfortunately I didn't know how.",0,3,Maria Kaparia,39910695

The course itself covered just about all that I thought they needed to cover, if not more, while the extra materials were very much appreciated. There were a few bugs in some of the tests, but otherwise I feel the course was exceptionally well done & that I have learned much from it.",0,0,Matthew Heald,113946038

14565830~COURSE!~I3YEDMSkEeyZlw5yhMZTYQ,1662834575090,4,0,"This was a very fun course! I loved being able to go through and reconstruct words in PIE based on what we learned in the videos and readings. I have a background in linguistics, though less on the comparative side of things, and think this course works well for beginners as well as those with a more formal background.My one complaint is that in order to finish the course you need to take the graded exam, but you can't take the graded exam unless you pay for a certificate...so there's no way to finish the course unless you pay to do so. Also, one of the exercises in Week 6 will be marked as complete on the desktop but not the phone so Week 6 always registers as 'incomplete' (this does not affect your ability to finish the course, though).",0,0,Ellie Passmore,14565830

102471~COURSE!~I3YEDMSkEeyZlw5yhMZTYQ,1664538371419,5,0,"I​ thuroughly enjoyed this course. My only critique is that some of the exercises required a copy an paste from the answers given because the expected answer contained a character that is not on a standard keyboard. These are common issues known to people using systems like Excel when you copy from certain sources into Excel, for example. A curved single quote vs '. Other problems I found were things like the question asked for the first reconstructed sound but then the question continued to give an example of reconstructing the entire root in such detail that it was confusing what exactly was expected as the answer. But the contents of the interviews and the difficulty of the questions in the quizes really made this course a lot of fun. I had casually read on this topic in the past and I have watched a number of lectures on YouTube by some of the professors who were interviewed but I had never gone into this much detail on topics like the larengyls and their reflexes int he daughter languages. If you are interested in PIE and the IEs, this course is essential.",0,0,Robert Kaucher,102471

I especially enjoyed learning about the sanskrit roots of indo-, and proto-indo european languages. Professor Tijmens Pronk has arranged the course in such a way, as to provide enough learning materials, along with the scope, and pace of the course, to make it an interesting, and rewarding experience. If you've already taken courses on coursera.org, from Leiden University on linguistics, and phonology, then this course is something, which you would enjoy as well.

Thanks to coursera, the univeristy and the instructors for creating such a technical yet engaging discourse. I learnt lot of practical linguistic skills.
