21102725~COURSE!~cqZ2Iv7LEeuRCQ5nvRqgMw,1658841680563,2,0,"First of all, I understood thigs I wanted to, before taking this course, so one star. This course has horrible explanation. Teacher's english was very hard to listen for me. Subtitles were necessery. Also repeating things as ""beautiful"" and ""You are amazing"" was not helpful -I felt forced to think about this course in particular way. Material shoud stands on it's own. The guided project file was not prepared with care. Numeration is wrong throgh the whole file. Teacher orders(while querying database) things redundantly while not mentioning it. Not using a fact that ASC order is default in SQL(intermidiete level course). That's very disappointing especially for a paid thing. ",0,0,Adam Smoli≈Ñski,21102725
