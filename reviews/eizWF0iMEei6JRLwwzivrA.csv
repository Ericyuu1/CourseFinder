Especially the practice homework problems are exceptional.While doing tests, I cleared the exam with required percentage, but I had given 1 or two wrong answers. This course structure could be improved to help us see where we went wrong with those questions.",0,3,Sailaja Akkem,4503198

27704335~COURSE!~eizWF0iMEei6JRLwwzivrA,1642932063227,5,0,T​he design and functionality of digital filters are beautfully explained and the underline mechanism too. The mathematics part is fairly simplified for beginners like me. The examples with animations and codes are very helpful in understanding and implementing the fiilters in real life applications. I specially love the signal of the day videos. I would lilke to thank the instructurs for making this course so good and attracting.,0,0,Dipanjan Barman,27704335

17997926~COURSE!~eizWF0iMEei6JRLwwzivrA,1613678211906,5,0,"Great quality maintained for this course as well - once again the lectures are full of clarity on the concepts, hammering home the real usefulness of the techniques shown and the homework assignments have been well designed to force learners to grasp the most important concepts. The Python notebooks are also a great addition. Although it's not necessary to pass the assignments and takes some extra time, as a further counterweight to the quite mathematical assignments I found it quite rewarding to write some Octave scripts to verify the correctness of my answers and to reinforce the connection between the maths and the practicality of the theories. Perhaps there could be added one or two home work assignments of designing filters to given requirements (this is covered in the lectures but perhaps not so present in the homework assignments). Looking forward to course 3!",0,0,Tommi Jokela,17997926

12548397~COURSE!~eizWF0iMEei6JRLwwzivrA,1607879972585,5,0,"I really enjoyed this course. The slides are very clear, and the lecturer puts great emphasis on story, as in you always know why you take such and such detour, why such theorem is interesting in the grander scheme. Really helped me understanding core concepts of DSP. The homework are a must-do, as they offer complementary information to the lectures. They prepare well to the graded exams. I would say the time estimates given by coursera are quite unrealistic. I spent much more time on homeworks than the required 1h per week, more like 3-4h to get things down. But I could just be a slow learner. Anyway, will probably jump to the next course in the series DSP3.",0,1,Guillaume Sautière,12548397
