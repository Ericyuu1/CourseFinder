The peer reviewed essays were good topics; but in one case definitely should have attached to the following week. The multiple choice tests, however, seemed to focus on trivia. Flawed; but still a really interesting course.",0,0,Caelyn McAulay,18149586
3382413~COURSE!~nnd5lshWEeSA1yIACye2oA,1447566178730,3,0,A fascinating course but delivered in a rather wooden fashion by the lecturer. Good illustrations. I would have liked to have known more of the overall value (if any) of the Jewish contribution in the context of Chinese economic development i.e. was it of any overall importance- did it make any difference? Is it still relevant?,0,0,Geoffrey Pasvol,3382413

7453860~COURSE!~nnd5lshWEeSA1yIACye2oA,1461618761094,4,0,"This course was unique in several ways.  It covers a subject from WWII and Jewish history that is largely overlooked.  The lectures were interspersed with video that added a unique flavor.  The students seem to come from a variety of countries.  As a student, some of the lecture material was difficult to understand, though presented in English; subtitles helped.  If there is a complaint of deficiency, it is the lack of support, feedback, or availability of staff on comment boards.  I encountered a problem due to a mis-counting of the peer reviews completed, and a delay in my grade, so finally gave up and kept doing peer reviews until it showed as complete.  The peer reviews on my own assignments were delayed.  I think 4 peer reviews is too much, whether from low enrollment, language barrier or other issue.  But I learned much, and this added to my current study of the role of China in WWII. ",0,0,Pamela J. Richmond,7453860

I lived in Tianjin for over four years and often passed the old Synagogue and wondered about its history. The videos in this series are well done and the information is just enough to be eye opening and engaging without being burdensome.

Apart from the history of the Jews in China I learnt a great deal about China in the 19th and 20th century. My only criticism of the course was the very confusing rubric for peer marking the assignments. The criteria were very specific and , in my view, didn't necessarily reflect the subject of the essay.
