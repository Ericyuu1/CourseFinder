79892360~COURSE!~M9dntkEoEeWZtA4u62x6lQ,1621299338862,1,0,"The level of this course was all over the place.  One assignment was about 10 lines of code and the next one was to implement Dijkstra's minimum path algorithm.  The lectures did not focus on the correct topics to do the assignments.   The explanations of the the algorithms were fine, but not the programming.  The lectures tended to use the adjacency matrix formulation for the graphs.  Although the assignment allowed you to use adjacency matrix, it seemed that the description preferred the pointer formulation.I don't think the specialization is organized well as the first two classes are intro level C programming classes.  But then the C++ course expects students to have at least a year of computer programming.  So the expectations are much higher for this course.   The course also seems to be no longer monitored by any TA's and most students do not post anything meaningful in the discussion forums.  So there is relatively no help.

On the positive side, the arguments are fairly interesting, especially the graph theory algorithms . The second assignment is requested in such a confusing manner that it looks harder than it is, so it's not hard as some people in the comments say.  This course doesn't really include much of the modern c++, in the last week some features of c++ 11 are discussed. The peer-review system is awful, often people will just give you random votes without even reading your code, furthermore it's common to encounter clearly plagiarized codes.Honestly I would not recommend this course , you could learn way more on your own with the same amount of time.

 What I didn't like about tboth of these courses: 1. Whoever has too

 The speaking speed is extremely slow btw. A lot of wasted time here. 2.
 Why only ppts? Why so lenghty and unclear explanations? Why don't you 
show live coding and explain the pitfalls? So much faster to get a good

The flip side was I didn't feel that the extended explanations of basic CS algorithms such as Minimum Spanning Tree and Shortest Path was necessary.   I knew those algorithms earlier.  But my biggest complaint was the basic inattention.  I felt like the course was on auto pilot.  At one point a submission of mine was returned.  I asked the forum for some kind of assistance or explanation from a mentor and no reply was given.  I re-did the assignment and it was accepted but there was still little comment.  And at the end of the course, my final assignment was only checked by two graders instead of three.  Was any human actually supervising things?  I saw no evidence.  Discouraging.

The assignments are designed such that you have the freedom to do the coding, yet you have the opportunity to develop simplified code by figuring out better ways of coding using STL.  So, for me, who knows C programming, it was through the assignments that I slowly upgraded from doing C programming to C++ programming by improvising on the same code I wrote for one homework by making use of STL in the next homework.
