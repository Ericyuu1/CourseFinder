12408250~COURSE!~xmZ6qD-0Eeuz-grD3z1nmw,1672131704310,1,0,"There are Quiz problems with the answers being wrong in two place, but more importantly the video on OUtput which shows you how to actually RUN  VB code is broken and points to the install video. And simply installing is not enough. VS Code and Visual Studio look NOTHING like the iteration in these videos (they do not even have tool bar menus and VB is not included in some set ups. This is not like Python where you can find 100+ development environments to work with, and MS is notoriously TERRIBLE and supporting current products with clear unmistakable directions. So, if you have an issue figuring out how to get hello world to run, you will remain stuck because the course is broken (and likely not in-depth enough either way) and microsoft visual studio products really are not user friendly at all!",0,0,Bethany Poulin,12408250
9447702~COURSE!~xmZ6qD-0Eeuz-grD3z1nmw,1637886655790,2,0,"The course could have been decent because it gives a lot of great information, but there were far too many typos to take it seriously. It seemed like almost every page had at least one spelling mistake. Plus, one quiz question gave credit for the wrong answer. This gives me the impression that either the instructor or LearnQuest themselves don't care about quality since none of those issues should exist in the final product with proper proofreading. I think I spent just as much time sending bug reports during the course as I did actually doing the course material itself and that's plain ridiculous.",0,0,Dan Tinsley,9447702
