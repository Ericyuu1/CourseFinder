2.First off, let me start by saying this is a very good
overview of what the Cybersecurity Terms are, but I wish it went deeper into
the subject.1.     
Having to pay just to take the quizzes for an
overview course is kind of a joke. I could see asking for money if you went
into more detail information regarding each lesson, but just telling me what
each term means and then pointing me to a website, then asking for 50 bucks is
kind of cheap considering no in-depth information was ever given.2.     
Why did you have all of those people that are in
the field of cybersecurity just read off a list of terms? You could have done
that, kind of a waste of time for those other people. I am guessing that you
had to pay them. Which would explain why you are asking 50 dollars just to take
the quizzes. 3.     
Where was the real life experience? Explain to
me the most common mistakes people make with each of the different type of
networks as securities. That would at least be worth 50 dollars, for some real world
practical use. I could have easily googled these terms and have in the past. I
