The setting of the Jupyter notebook allows the learners to go back and change each code block to modify/troubleshoot and study in a good way.It is good that learners are allowed to access all the course materials and graded parts for free. I like that way because I can arrange my time to finish the course first and pay the fee to upgrade (get the certificate) later. In other courses I paid the fee upfront but I was later too busy on other things and couldn't finish those courses and then lost my money.  ",0,0,Vu Nguyen,3508764

His intimate familiarity and comfort with the material is certainly key to the clear explanation of concepts he provides.The subject material was something I should have learned at a younger age. Those planning to pursue a career in Geophysics will benefit greatly from this course. Many topics are covered in the course, the use of Green's functions is clarified, finite difference methods are derived and illustrated using Taylor series expansions, pseudospectral methods are developed... It was nice to return to uses of Chebyhev polynmials, Lagrange and Legendre polynomials and get a better grasp of their use. The psudospectral section was particularly fascinating since geophysicists routinely use Fourier transforms in their analysis and the applications to simulation provide new insights into their use.There is much to be gained through the course. I suspect it is at an intermediate level and serves as a good foundation for more advanced study.
