98505162~COURSE!~VivQGEdIEemEVA7yMJH7Bg,1646405372091,1,0,"A horrid end-to-end user experience. The videos are virtually worthless as the presenter reads the script way too fast. People for whom English is a second language will struggle trying to understand her. Just put her on mute. However, you need to take screen shots of the slides of the video, as that is the only way to have them available to study as they are not available for download! With the screen shots and provided transcript, you have basic study materials, which you need to augment using the Resources materials. There is more useful information on additional Winnforum  docs.  All in all a very user unfriendly and abusive learning experience. The pain doesn't end there however.  When you go to take the test, it is surprisingly revealed to you that your computer and test environment need to meet certain requirements. The whole ProctorU process is just awful. Especially if you do not have access to the proper type of computer (surprise for all you Google-centric people!), room and connectivity. Google should make this clear before you plunk down your money. I went through hell trying to accomplish that in our rural, underserved community, ironically just the kind of place where CBRS could be really useful in bridging the Digital Divide. The impetus for my taking this class is that we are working with community groups who want to set up and maintain their own FWA ""micro ISPs"".  For instance, the ProctorU video system could not provide my video even though we had been on  Teams  and Meet calls quite seamlessly right before hand (I had to go over to a neighboring colleauge who had the ""right"" kind of computer but we guess the wrong level of connectivity). The ProctorU and Google support were useless.  I finally had to drive to the next county, where the community college's testing center figured out a way for me to take the ProctorU exam. Cost me another 25 bucks.  They administer other online virtual proctoring systems and were amazed at how bad ProctorU was.  The antiquated ProctorU system and it's ""Proctor"" and ""Technician"" managed to screw up the set up process by restarting the computer and thus wiping out the session, so I had to figure out how to reconnect and had to go through the lengthy and awkward set up process all over again. I had to beg my new ""proctor"" not to restart the computer. As you may surmise, we will NOT be recommending this course to others we know who want to become actual CPI's. There are people who are installers for things like satellite dishes who want to be part of these community efforts. And Google has moved way down the list of potential SAS providers if this is how they treat their customers. I can only assume that all the high ratings for this class came from Google employees and friends and family. By the way, it would be nice to know which questions you got wrong. I passed with a 92% score, but would like to know which 4 questions I got wrong. ",0,0,George Hechtman,98505162

The Coursera platform is sub-par. I expected more for a high-cost training.  Rough edges like not being able to proceed to the next step without a browser refresh show a lack of competence and/or attention. The ProcterU test taking process is even worse. You don't find out until you start the test at the scheduled time that you have to download and run an executable from LogMeIn (Support-LogMeInRescue.exe) That file is identified as a threat by Windows (unsigned) and is blocked by corporate InfoSec policies. I had to move to a different computer to take the test. Furthermore, the ProcterU chat support is completely non-functional - it tells you to open a chat widget on the page that doesn't exist.
