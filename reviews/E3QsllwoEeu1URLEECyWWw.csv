The lecturer or tutor taught so poorly as if he is tired or forced to lecture. Poor delivery at its highest, regretably!",0,0,Pastor Daniel Ekpe,105181295
112865612~COURSE!~E3QsllwoEeu1URLEECyWWw,1664221103069,1,0,"Seriously, do not waste your time in this course. Only take this course if you want to have a badge or something for your curriculum if you have no experience. But you will not become anything close to a Scrum Master.
It is a BAD presentation of slides and the instructor is just winging it. It is annoying and ridiculous the amount of aahh, mmm, so, again, the presenter uses. He might have known the subject at one time, but he doesn't show it now; he is a bad teacher and not a good speaker. Also, compared to other courses, it is obvious that it is a one-man job. Nobody checked the quality of the content or the presentation. No user input was accounted for, and no expert reviewed the structure or content so as to give him some early feedback. That is ironic, since that is central to Agile methodology. It is obvious he did not treat this course as a project.
It is made up a a few videos (you never get to see the instructor) of slides, and then there are 2-3 readings from Wikipedia or other sites. Some of the readings are very good, but others are very biased since the site is trying to sell you something. Also, some of the readings he links to, are dead links.

The content is very low quality, shallow and badly presented. You can get more value from researching by yourself. The “practical” examples and assignments are so lame, that they add zero to the course. They are a joke.
This review may sound too harsh. Maybe it is so because I finished the Google Project Management Certificate and I am comparing it to that. That course sets the bar very high. But in any case, you can find MUCH better content in YT that clearly shows the presenter's dominance of the subject.  ",0,0,Eduardo Aceves,112865612

By all means, follow this guidance if you want to work in a large, dysfunctional corporate environment - but regard any mention of SAFe with a large bucket of salt: if it looks like impenetrable jargon that seems entirely at odds with the core values of Scrum, that's because it is.",0,1,Joanna Weber,4024000
