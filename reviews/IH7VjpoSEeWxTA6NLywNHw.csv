One thing I would suggest is to add explanations to the answers of quizez. Explanations guide people to think on their mistakes and alternative solutions. I kinda struggled without these. Please, add them! To show WHY something is wrong.

It explains everything clearly and might be much easier to grasp the main idea of microeconomics than read a textbook alone.

I would take more courses from Dr. Stein, and in fact have enrolled in the 2nd piece of her microeconomics course, ""How Markets Fail.""  Examples are very good, standard terminology is used, even when it shows a free-market bias, such as used when discussing taxes and subsidies.  Given that Adam Smith insisted that government structures were necessary for the proper functioning of markets (e.g. contract law, free flow of information), such bias in the terminology is disturbing - but so it has been for a long time.For several years I taught a course in community college, ""Calculus for Business and Economics,"" which focused on the applicability of calculus, the mathematics of change, especially non-linear change, to microeconomic principles. This course would have been a perfect pre-req for that course, better than the usual 1st-term college micro course, in that it summarized the key elements and demonstrated them graphically, leaving an opening to discuss such topics as elasticity and surplus when the demand and supply curves are non-linear.",0,4,Larry L English,5851279
