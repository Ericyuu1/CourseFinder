5375670~COURSE!~FsCafMqOEeurrRK5Liel7w,1664480419160,1,0,"T​opics can be explained much more simpler than they are explained here. For instance, it does not add too much value to memorize (because it's in the quiz) how many cores of CPU is used in a debug session. Or which version SSIS projects were introduced in SQL Server (reminder: this is not a SQL Server training).Also the exercises do not provide a VM to test your knowledge like in GCP or IBM's trainings.

However the main issue is that a lot of the content is very hard to complete because it seems to come from somewhere else (e.g. a Microsoft training course) but the critical setup information was not copied as well. This means that to actually do the exercises the student needs their own Azure credit, and also needs to dig around random github repos to find the matching datasets. Additionally there are pretty rampant typos. This is not a well made course, and needs serious work.",0,18,Augustus Hebblewhite,2830909

However, Microsoft should rebuild this course adding more labs and other practical material. For beginner, the course is very advanced. For intermediate and advanced, the course is a copy and paste from manuals. There is a mid-way that you need to fill. The videos is good, but, need more practical exercises with prepared correct environment.",0,3,Gregory Oliveira,94295016
