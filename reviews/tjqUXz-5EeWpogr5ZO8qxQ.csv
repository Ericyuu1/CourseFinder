12085810~COURSE!~tjqUXz-5EeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,1521039671748,1,0," interesting course. However it dosen't take 11 modules to explain it.  This was BORING AS HELL!   here is how you solve the financial crisis: First, only buy what you need. Second make your own jobs if you cannot find one. Find a skill you are good at and make that your job. Third, paper money is going to be worthless soon anyway so either use bartering or some other form of currency. This will probably happen pretty soon. If one currency collapses another  form of currency takes its place.",0,0,Jonathan Golland,12085810

However, there is a lot about factual details, but a deafening silence about the shortcomings of the US and international financial systems. Notably about consumer protection in the US, and lack thereof. Also notably about the shortcomings of the Basel II Accord.As for the discussion forum: it is mentored and moderated in the 'Agitprop' style (Agitprop: Ministry of Agitation and Propaganda, 'communication' organ of the North Korea State). It is not geared as a complement of the lectures or a discussion forum, but as a way to push people into thinking whatever, in a directive, patronising and childish way.",0,0,Fred Vacelet,52392326
308214~COURSE!~tjqUXz-5EeWpogr5ZO8qxQ,1463945649012,2,0,"a) There clearly was a huge amount of criminal behavior that contributed to the crisis. The presenters appear to approach the subject half-heartedly, and focus their energies on disproving the possibility without sufficiently examining it. b) A lot of the review questions focus on remembering facts rather  than on understanding the causes and effects. For example, what is the relevance of being able to remember that job losses at the height of the crisis were of the order of 880k a month or 200k a month??c) It is obvious to anyone with even trivial financial expertise that the financial system today is weaker than it was before the crisis. The too big to fail are bigger today (by a large margin) and interest rates are too low (remember the search for yield was the motivation for the creation of the exotic securities which blew up the system). Secy Geithner's focus in week 8 comes across as a personal defence of his actions rather an objective analysis of what was done and should have been done.",0,15,Dinesh Rehani,308214

Stating, as if it is a given, late in the course, that there are times when it is okay to introduce a moral hazard.  Erroneously defining fiat money early in the course.  Stating, again as if it were a given, that deficit spending is naturally the right answer to a crisis.

Andrew Metrick and Tim Geithner are highly knowledgeable and engaging teachers with a lightness of touch that conceals a masterful grasp of their subject. They use apt analogies to break down what are, in some cases, quite complex financial constructions to make them comprehensible to a lay audience (while my education was in the sciences, I consider myself a novice in economics and finance - though perhaps not any more). I found myself looking up the occasional phrase or acronym but almost every specialist term was fully defined in the lectures.

One of the highlights of the course was having a direct insight from someone who was, not just there on the ground in '07-'09, but in many ways the conductor of the US response to the crisis. Having Secretary Geithner as a lecturer initially sold me on this course, and I was not disappointed. There is a messiness to the GFC that can be overwhelming in some of the deep dives, as you might expect with such a complex historical event, but in the final lectures he brings it together with some simple (and reassuring) rules about how a government might proceed in the future, in the knowledge that crises do occur and cannot be predicted. Geithner has the bearing of a financial Confucian; quiet and thoughtful, yet exacting; emphasising fiscal and financial prudence for governments and bank-like institutions, while showing compassion and concern for those citizens that bore the brunt of the crisis. I hope and expect that some of these important teachings are enshrined and elevated to the high status that they deserve.",0,2,Fahad Sperinck,37673939

Considering Geithners special position as Secretary of the Treasury at the time it is therefore very firsthand and insightful information however there is always the risk of contamination from what was done as opposed to what could have been done.
