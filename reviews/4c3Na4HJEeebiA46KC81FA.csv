There was a lot of reading to be done, which wasn't the problem. It supported what was being shown in the videos. However, during the videos the professor would then quote very large passages of what had already been read. This took away from the enjoyment of the topic. His voice was very monotonous, and having already read the information, a brief reference would have been better. Too much time was spent repeating information that had been covered. It was very obvious that the professor was reading off his cue cards. The title is misleading as one expects to learn about the cathedrals of the time period. Only three were ever discussed, and the rest of the lessons were only peripherally related.",0,3,Wendi Solinger,25120357

11643407~COURSE!~4c3Na4HJEeebiA46KC81FA,1640465986788,4,0,"I liked the class quite a bit, and certainly learned a lot.  It has inspired my revisiting some of the French gothic cathedrals armed with my deeper understanding of them.  Professor Bloch is deeply knowledgeable and engaging, and the progression of the material is thoughtful.   I particularly appreciated the blend of history, engineering, sociology, theology and literature in presenting the context in which Gothic Cathedrals came to be.
That said, there are a number of relatively minor annoyances in the class, mainly from poor maintenance, and it seems to me they should be addressed since people continue to take this class year after year.

* Some of the time estimates for the readings are grossly inaccurate.  The most egregious error is estimating that a 197 page (dense) document can be read in 30 minutes.
* Some of the titles of the essay assignments are completely unrelated to the actual assignment.  In the forum, some students complain that since they answered the question (rather than the inferred question from the title) they were poorly graded by peers.
* Some of the essay assignments are unrelated to that week’s materials for some reason, such as in week 7.  Perhaps this is intentional, but it is confusing.
* The transcriptions of the videos are very helpful, but are riddled with mistakes, often due to the incorrect use of homonyms.  Perhaps speech recognition was used, but they should be proofread.
* Perhaps most disappointing to me is the lack of any mention of the tragic fire at Notre Dame in 2019.  The course devotes an entire week to Notre Dame, and it feels uncomfortable knowing that the cathedral sustained profound damage without the course even acknowledging the tragedy.

I have iterated the areas that need maintenance not as a pedantic complaint, but hopefully as a guide for one of Professor Bloch’s TAs to address them.

The professor obviously knows his subject matter and was mostly able to convey the material in an interesting manner. However, there was less personal interaction than there could have been. These were simply well thought out, well prepared and well delivered lectured but the presentations lacked spark and enthusiasm and humor....Which is not as much a criticism as a statement of fact. Considering that Notre Dame in Paris has been decimated by a fire, the course needs to update the course to at least mention that Notre Dame, as we knew it, is no longer.

SOLOMAN instead of SOLOMON. RONCESVALS instead of RONCESVALLES. At one point Prof. Bloch said ""Louis XVI the Sun King"". It is Louis XIV. Nothing that cannot be corrected.
