100001701~COURSE!~CFbsT5vxEeuX0g5JcUzcow,1654271890398,1,0,"Not a beginner friendly course, very little explaination !All topics are quickly covered and details are skipped. Learners without image processing knowledge or advanced math will easily struggle and get stuck. Furthermore, after hours and hours trying to understand strange equations that the lecturer quicky covered, leaners would be frustrated as those equations won't be used or even seen again. Most importantly, not a single example was given, not a single coding assignment exists !Worst course I've ever taken. Those giving 5 stars probably already known all the things.",0,7,Derek Thompson,100001701
97845032~COURSE!~CFbsT5vxEeuX0g5JcUzcow,1652185620856,1,0,"I'm giving 1 star because of this description: ""Students are required to know the fundamentals of linear algebra and the fundamentals of calculus. No prior knowledge of imaging or computer vision are assumed.""in fact, the teacher taught as if he assumed you have prior knowledge of imaging or computer vision. Complex maths were not well covered, discussion forum was helpless. ",0,2,Andrew,97845032

1580095~COURSE!~CFbsT5vxEeuX0g5JcUzcow,1639962873034,4,0,Some topics are too advanced for a beginner course. Some basic and fundamental materials are not clearly covered.

44385682~COURSE!~CFbsT5vxEeuX0g5JcUzcow,1671636463297,5,0,"This gives a quick review of the basics of optics and Fourier transforms, and some of the other math and algorithms associated with vision. The topics can be a little quick at times. If you haven't already done a course in Fourier transforms, for instance, you can easily get lost in the overview. The presentation does of good job of capturing the qualitative aspects, but you may get lost in the details when taking the quizzes.The strength here is the good, clear presentation of the topics.",0,0,Joe Serrano,44385682
