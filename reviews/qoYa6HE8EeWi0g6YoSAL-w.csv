I would advise the teacher to work on his vocalization. It's sometimes difficult to understand what he's saying. Also, the class should be more dynamic for this complex subject to be easier to understand.
I consider myself intelligent, and I found his final assignment in the Human Resources Capstone to be challenging to complete and repetitive. In addition, he only provided a few examples of what he wanted us to achieve in this project.

I put a lot of work and effort in and it was greatly demoralized to see the end result. I believe the grading system and weight awarded to peer graded assignments need to be reviewed as not all 'peers' are equal in knowledge, aptitude, comprehension, intellect, and use of English.
