369816~COURSE!~3oznDIM5EeeW1A7RTAITCg,1638347828950,3,0,T​he course touched on critical theoretical concepts around I/O efficiency while designing algorithms but I felt the resource notes lacked depth and clarity (they had overlap with the video lessons). Would have been good to get insight into solutions for exercises (at least on the course notes),0,0,Raghu Venkatesh,369816

There's also not much support going around in the discussion boards. Nevertheless, the material is easily self-teachable and you'll come out of the course knowing a couple more tools and tricks than you started with.",0,1,Nicholas Pun,1416199
