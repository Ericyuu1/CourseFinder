6290108~COURSE!~TTceSz4iEeuwehK5Ir7QEw,1639876077915,3,0,"Some of the material was fabulous and there were modules where the information was insightful and useful.  The problem seems to be a lack of clarity.  The course promotes a view that imagines central planning by smart people who know math and are 'experts' in modelling to be superior to a system where price discovery in a free market regulate decisions.  The course creators ignore the fact that a good society has to be one where citizens are free and have natural rights that cannot be violated by well-meaning academics or busybodies.  Many of the statements that I heard are not supported by either logic or science and ignore the Augustinian view of human nature.  Let me start with one.  We know that we are now colder on average than we have been for much of the past 9,000 years.  We know that when temperatures fell civilizations fell.  That was what happened to Rome.  It was what created the chaos during the time of the Black Death and what pushed the Vikings from Greenland.  Do we really think that the cold of the Little Ice Age was preferable to temperatures today or can ignore the fact that longer growing seasons and the lower need for heating homes in the winter has made life much better for the poor?  Why was Michael Oppenheimer permitted to claim that having political operative create a summary better than having scientists telling us what they know about the literature regarding the AGW claims?  Why did the 'experts' ignore the fact that the IPCC's climate models ran hot or that the economists are quite clear that an increase in average temperatures of 3.5C or more is beneficial to humanity?  Why is Princeton  talking about sea level increases when Antarctic ice has increased in the past half century and the DMI is clear that the number of melt days has not changed in Greenland?  Also not mentioned is the fact that an increasing 'average global temperature', whatever that means, would mean much higher increases at higher latitudes, mostly during the winter nights and that the lower difference in energy would make storms less damaging.  If the AGW were actually true, we would have a kinder weather and a lower need for all that heating in the cold regions along with longer growing seasons and more food that offers the poor lower prices.  I will end this in a moment but let me note the COVID problem.  It was not the virus that shut down the economy.  That was politicians.  The virus was not and is not very dangerous.  Fat old guys are more vulnerable but once the first wave went through the nursing homes, most of the victims that could die were no longer for us to help them.  Add to this the disastrous loss of liberty that presents a systemic risk and the opportunity for objective discourse was lost.  I know that academics have a hard time taking a stand that risks their careers and reduces their incomes but I am not sure that the ethical price that has to be paid is worth the higher material gains.  Independent thinkers do not follow banners and social fads.  Those that have read their Bulgakov agree that cowardice is a common sin and a horrible sin.  Or if you are into Dante, keep in mind where the uncommitted wound up.  Heaven cast them out but Hell rejected them.  That seems like a miserable way to go through life, boys and girls.  Verify everything that you are told because things may not be what you are told they are.  ",0,0,Vangel Vesovski,6290108

8022042~COURSE!~TTceSz4iEeuwehK5Ir7QEw,1635649169710,3,0,"I really enjoyed Prof Centeno's course ""Paradoxes of War"", and was looking forward for more. I liked the idea behind this course. It seems very relevant and how it could provide a cross functional framework for reiterating and reinforcing some important ideas. However, I found the content lacking, and I think it needs more work.On the one hand, much of the time is spent around the introductory concepts, but on the other, most of them are given only superficial treatment, which can sometimes be somewhat misleading. To give some examples of the latter, I found the presentation of chaos theory, the trolley dilemma, and cascading failures hard to stomach, being quite familiar with the topics. The graphics on some of the slides seem curiously irrelevant which did not leave a good impression.Most of the course content is in the interviews, which are of varying interest - I enjoyed some very much, but some of the others seemed superficial redundant.Overall, I felt the course helped me reiterate some points, but did not provide much value. Being interested in this topic, I am familiar with the fundamentals, and that part of the course felt redundant and in many parts too sketchy. It definitely does not provide a solid foundation, but maybe it gives enough background to get people interested in further exploration. The second half of the course was interesting, but too short.",0,0,Dmitry Zinenko,8022042
29007784~COURSE!~TTceSz4iEeuwehK5Ir7QEw,1663937698321,4,0,"M​uch of the course material was directed at undergraduates in the US. That has advantages and disadvantages. Professor Centeno was engaging and competent, so hats off to him.  He set out the definitions very well, but I do wish he had more global examples instead of using American High School society to illustrate the elements of a social system and networks. The COVID section is already out of date, so that will need revision. P​robably it is brave for an academic at Princeton U. to point out that globalisation has downsides, but for me the critical analyses were too still shallow.  There were many downsides of globalisation that were either mentioned in passing but not considered in depth or not mentioned at all. For example the  systemic effects of the 'human enterprise' as William Rees calls it, on the ecological systems is hardly covered. Also the  depth, scope and persistence of human suffering that globalisation has brought and brings is not really on the 'menu'. The horrendous effects of global industry such as exponentially increased mining, the development and employment of 300 thousand chemicals that are mostly finding their way into the atmosphere, in landfills, i fresh water in the oceans  with no regulation are just a few examples. I think it would be helpful to use the  nine planetary boundaries developed by the Resilience Institute in Stockholm in this course, as  the discipline of earth systems science provides their foundation. Also, the crossing of the BPs is a direct result of globalisation.  Why are earth system science findings not included? Also globalisation of industrial agriculture pollutes every ecosystem it touches and ruins the lives and livellhoods of small farmers, small fisherfolk, indigenous peoples and marginalised people  who live in scarifice zones. These people and the ecosystems did not get much love or attention although the 'story' of globalisation cannt be told without including structures  and patterns to achieve and maintain domination to have  'cheap labour, cheap energy, cheap food and cheap resources (Jason Moore). T​he interviews were very insteresting some better than others. It would have been nice of the Prof had now and then asked a follow up question with a bit of bite, instead of only softball questions but I guess he was grateful to have the interviewees agree to talk to him. T​he reading list seems OK but it is a shame that the discussion questions are always about personalisation and never about the reading.  Including a few short texts or excerpts and asking some good questions or setting some exercises in relation to those texts would add a lot to the learning experience.  Professor Centeno's  article (with colleagues) on The emergence of global systemic risk  from 2015 for example  could have been usedin week one or week two. I added a reading list of my own for week 6 as there was none given. If you need me to send it again let me know. In that context why not offer us a chance to upload articles for others? A​ll in all the prof and team did a good job for a first venture into this difficult topic and I give them a lot of credit for the effort. ",0,0,Marion Troia,29007784

The comprehensibility of the material is improved substantially by a living, immersive example: the current global situation hitting all of us, in one way or another, in the face. At a certain point, we could no longer rely on reductionism – addressing a problem piece-by-piece and in a siloed manner – to satisfactorily address our collective woes, and this course allowed me to appreciate why this has been solidly the case perhaps even before I was born. The balance of efficiency and fragility, on one side, and redundancy and resilience/robustness, on the other, in terms of their pros and cons is long due for a reckoning. This offering should serve as a comprehensive introduction to systems thinking, complexity science, risk analysis, and the background-foreground forces and implications of globalization for those who have no advanced degrees or work experience in these disciplines.  Furthermore, the end-of-module interviews each gave me at least one eye-opening thought, and I sometimes even wished that some discussions were longer.
