91081482~COURSE!~K9cwvyTbEeenjw6oiOFT7g,1631191000055,1,0,"This course has a good content. However, I cannot give it more than one star due to its assignments, peer-grading and misleading information. Firstly, the course is not self-paced as announced. You will have to deliver within given dates to pass the course. Thus it is not really self-paced. Secondly, the first assignment is massive. One of the questions in the assignment asks you to create a feedback plan for the entire course you will teach...for every week!! That will be a huge undertaking if your course lasts for a whole semester. And this is just one of the questions. Thirdly, your fellow students will be grading you!! Better cross your fingers and hope that they have understood the curriculum or you will be in trouble. When I pay for a self-paced course I expect it to be self-paced. I also expect the grading to be fair, and not randomly set by a student that may or may not be competent. In summary, I did not bother to finish this course, and I cannot recommend it to anyone else.  ",0,1,Kari Dakota Aasheim,91081482
46512297~COURSE!~K9cwvyTbEeenjw6oiOFT7g,1598462900268,2,0,"Yes, the ideas are great. You learn a lot from the videos and some of the readings. However, many of the readings require you to purchase them. That, however, is a small thing. The main reason I give this certificate class 2 stars is that the peer review assignments and the final quiz suck. We are asked to grade for things that weren't presented in the lectures, readings or the assignments themselves. The final quiz asks a LOT of questions about our interpretations related to statistical data; this was NOT covered in the lectures. I didn't do much of the readings on this because statistics isn't something I know or understand, so doing those readings wouldn't have helped me to pass the first time. Yes, I had to retake it; my second result was 83%, but most of the questions I missed were related to these interpretations of statistics (no surprise there, right?). There was a clear lack of alignment, something they emphasized in the lectures. It suggests that the teachers who created this course don't practice the things they're asking us to do, and the best evidence for that is the graded assignments. This certificate was free to me due to CourseraPlus; if you're thinking about spending money, don't. Just audit this certificate class, as you'll get more out of it that way. Spending money on this is a waste of money unless you need to have the certificate for your institution. I feel my learning was cheated.",0,0,Vanessa Raney,46512297
58084013~COURSE!~K9cwvyTbEeenjw6oiOFT7g,1592130889228,2,0,"The course was a high quality course. Well designed with challenging tasks . The content was varied with different learning activities which took devoted  time for reading , thinking, designing , writing and presenting, and submitting .  The reason why I give two stars is simple :  Taking into account how difficult and detail oriented was the first assignment which included : Utility Formula with its reflection, weighting on assessment with its reflection, assessment plan with its reflection, assessment matrix with its reflection and feedback plan ; I did not consider professional  the feedback that I personally  received by one of my peers   Considering the quality of the work I presented because I shared my work with colleagues for peer reviewing BEFORE I submitted and adjust it as well. The most delicate thing is that Also I do not think that is students's Job to assess particular assignments for this specific course because this is a avery specific area of expertise; Its simple If we took this course is because we have very little knowledge on how to approach and deal with assessment. Thus, grading important assigments should not be given to begginers learners or people that belong to other disciplines such as enginneering because their area is not about pedagogy or education itself . The last reason is the final quiz was completely disconnected with the learning objectives given at the beggining of the course and the type of videos and activities done  all these weeks. There was not coherence with the learning activities, learning objectives and the FINAL quiz sorry and I feel dissapointed because at first we had these amazing videos and resources and lastly we faced a quiz based on statistics that was not stating at the beggining as part fo learning objectives.

I felt I had learned a lot during the session. It was a lot of work into the course, but that was good because it did help me learn. What I did not like about the course is the way it was assessed by peers. The reason for this is, I feel that the peers did not fully read my assignments as I was told I was missing information. I had doubled checked and all the information was there, but it is on a second page, so if they do not see it, they just gave me a 0, with my only feedback being that I did not complete the assignment.... Part of this course was learning about how to provide constructive feedback, but if they do not look at the whole assignment, they are not able to provide the constructive feedback that would benefit me. Therefore, the peer assessment did not work very well in my case. ",0,0,Theresa Ragland,86177118

31717360~COURSE!~K9cwvyTbEeenjw6oiOFT7g,1593472716814,4,0,"Overall, this is a very well structured course insofar that it provides learners with a strong foundation in creating assessment plans. Learners who complete this course will walk away with the ability to create learning activities that are aligned with clear CABD learning objectives.  Assignments are straight-forward and give ample opportunities for learners to apply the various knowledge and skills gained through the various modules in this course. One key drawback of this course is that it relies on a peer-reviewed system. In my experience, I saw a number of students who did not provide any feedback on my assignments. As such, I did not find the ""peer-review"" aspect of this course to be helpful at all. A second key drawback is that there appear to be a large number of students who will try to ""cheese"" their way through the course. I wanted to provide meaningful peer feedback for my fellow classmates. However, my ability to do so was limited by classmates who submitted blank assignments — as if expecting that no one would flag them. Thirdly and lastly, the final quiz in Module 5 is difficult in that several of the questions ask learners to judge the quality of multiple choice questions. I found the quiz itself to be a bit ironic, given that many of the educators leading the modules in this course stressed that it is important to issue assessments that accurately test what a learner learned during the course. There was minimal emphasis on how to evaluate multiple choice questions in this course, which was why I found the final quiz so difficult.",0,0,Josh Chan,31717360

Some builds more actual case-studies to view to see rather than verbally discussed would have been useful for me personally. I also liked the interactions with my peers too. The platform is robust and clear with good nav UX (User Experience, Navigation) So important for the online student. A few glitches using from iPad to mobile but that's minor.
