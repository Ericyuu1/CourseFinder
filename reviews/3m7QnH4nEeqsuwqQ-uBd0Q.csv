Most obvious we use SQLiteStudio so we've learned the features of the program. The most excellent part of the course is you're learning with practice simultaneously. However, I had thought that I've learned about query a little bit and I've not. Despite that, the course was the begining of my journey about Data and Data Analysis. I also want to thank the instructor for clean and understandable expression of the lecture.",0,0,Yagmur Baran,44697751
