84584725~COURSE!~lWaEE511EeumjQpfkrsEYQ,1664855973559,1,0,"T​his is the worst online course that I've taken in my entire life. Labs are not debugged. Python API for Spark has a great potential for learning  but in this course it is covered in a superficial way and the explanation is not clear.L​abs are not debugged, I would put a minus five star.I don't understand how a company like IBM, which has provided so many technological advances to the world, is delivering such a bad course. And the most impressive thing for me is that the course was made by more than 10 persons according to Team & Acknowledgements. I​f you really want to learn about Spark, I'll recommend you the course Spark and Python for Big Data (Jose Portilla).Finally. This course is bad BUT THE SPECIALIZATION IS GOOD (in overall) IF YOU ARE STARTING YOUR JOURNEY AS DATA ENGINEER.",0,6,Santiago Zuluaga Ayala,84584725
103864219~COURSE!~lWaEE511EeumjQpfkrsEYQ,1649239050947,1,0,"Pretty horrible experience. While working on the assignment I got banned for ""improper conduct"" (no further explanation given) by the IBM Skills Network (the provider of the hands-on environment). I opened a support ticket there (31st of March) which remains unanswered until today (6th of April). In essence I paid for 1 month access to the course, and as it stands, i could not work on the content for more than a quarter of the time.Interestingly, I had a very similar experience (hands-on labs not working for days at a time) when i did an IBM (Data Analytics) course a few years back at edX. So given my current experience, I would strongly discourage doing any of the IBM courses that involve the IBM Skills Network. ",0,2,A. C.,103864219

Yo need to learn some statistics and ML theorical concepts previously.Labs cannot be do it only with the explanations of the videos.... The final project shouldn't be the place where you see a decision tree.Also, there is a some commands that work in a bad way in the labs. I think the course need a complete revision, keeping in mind that a lot of learners do the course as part of a certification and had no experience with ML and a only a little with spark.",0,3,Cristina Martinez Mazon,84136226
