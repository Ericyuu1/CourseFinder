57468786~COURSE!~Z74dm6YFEeiLXw4QLApQMg,1660312873823,1,0,"In the series of four courses under FPGA Embedded systems, I found only the introductory course helpful. Course 2 and 3 have been cursory at best. There's no proper explanation on how to work on the DE Lite boards, the professors are just reading out of the slides without explaining anything. There are no responses to the queries. Don't waste your time doing these courses. I'm only sticing to it because I paid the money. It's an absolute waste of time.",0,0,Aditya Vamsi Pulipakam,57468786

Don't waste your time here.If you want to learn about soft-processor architectures this course is absolutely not for you.I​f your intention is to get extra 3 points for your university degree, then this series of 4 courses can be useful, but keep in mind that you'll learn almost nothing.As expected, this 4 courses specialization is no more and no less than a w​aste of time and money.

A laser point while they are presenting is mandatory for following up. Also, some of the material, and they are a lot actually, requires to be illustrated through the Quartus tool itself rather than the snippets presented through the course! And finally as advice for the learners, don't underestimate the reading section, it helps me a lot specifically the first module readings.",0,0,Mohamed Ramadan Hafez,8504521
