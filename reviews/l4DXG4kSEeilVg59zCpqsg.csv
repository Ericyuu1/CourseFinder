32004271~COURSE!~l4DXG4kSEeilVg59zCpqsg,1560539017656,2,0,"Course contents are very good, able to learn a lot. However, very frustrating system is - project assignment submissions of last week has to wait for infinite time to be graded by peers. Wait time to get feedback on your submission is extremely long and very annoying to have such a long wait. Either, mentors of this course should step forward and help in this review process at periodic intervals or, this system should go away and it should NOT be mandatory requirement to complete this course. For poor grading system that is in place for project submission - am submitting 2 stars, otherwise I would have gone for 4 or 5 hands down",0,1,surendar ramamoorthy,32004271

For instance, there is a demo in Python for Linear Regression and Autoregression, but some brought up methods are not demonstrated in Python. It is a shame, though, because this course had a lot of promise.",0,1,Nguyen Tran,19434602
