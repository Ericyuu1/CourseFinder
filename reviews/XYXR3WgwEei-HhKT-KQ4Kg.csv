Also the lectures inside the specialization focused too much on math and too little on practice and on algorithms explanations.  It's good to have some idea about the math behind but I would have rather preferred working with python machine learning and NLP stuff than with creating math functions from scratch in python considering it already has its own libraries to do them. Also the explanations were not that perfect and a better English speaking teachers would be appreciated.IBM Data Science Professional Certificate was much much better and maybe I had higher expectations from this one as well.
