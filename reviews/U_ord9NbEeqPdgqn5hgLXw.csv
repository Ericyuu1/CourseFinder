3605861~COURSE!~U_ord9NbEeqPdgqn5hgLXw,1639594506374,1,0,"The instructor did not provide a thorough description of what git really is, nor github, or how it interacts with VS Code.  Most importantly the instructor didn't cover WHY any particular task was being done, or how any particular step fits in a workflow.  She simply shows what options are present under each menu in the applications (again, without saying WHY you'd be looking for anything there.)   A simple, real world example would suffice, e.g. ""Suppose you're working on a software or coding project with someone else. Here's how you would share your code with them, and here's how you'd share your code updates"".  But nothing of this sort was introduced.  Save your money and read the docs.

37563833~COURSE!~U_ord9NbEeqPdgqn5hgLXw,1615681144565,2,0,"I was excited about this 'guided project'. The Instructor enunciates well and speaks at a reasonable pace. And Coursera's Rhyme learning environment works very well. Unfortunately, that's the end of the good things about this course. While I realize that a 1-2 hour course cannot cover many topics, nor go into too much depth on any topic, this Introduction does not go into enough detail on any topic to be useful. A substantial amount of time is spent simply telling us the names of some of the features of Github and VS Code while providing little or no explanation about what those features actually do. I think perhaps trying to introduce both Github and VS Code is too much for 1-2 hours. I think perhaps that learners might be better served if there was two separate projects -- 'Introduction to Github' and 'Introduction to VS Code' --  that were each 1-2 hours. (I am sorry if this review comes across as overly negative but I would do a disservice to my fellow learners if I did not give an honest review.)",0,3,Gary Crosby,37563833
