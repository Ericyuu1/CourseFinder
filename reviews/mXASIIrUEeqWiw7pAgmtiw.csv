10862958~COURSE!~mXASIIrUEeqWiw7pAgmtiw,1653984974805,4,0,"A​ well-organized course that is about the very basics of RF circuit design. The lab part is a nice feature, although there is not much of real RF design at 1 MHz and a solderless breadboard; nevertheless, there is a lot to learn with experimenting after studying the related theory. I really enjoyed every part of it.",0,0,George Metaxas,10862958

90403372~COURSE!~mXASIIrUEeqWiw7pAgmtiw,1629472495871,4,0,"Overall, I can strongly recommend this course to everybody who wants to learn the basics of RF circuit design and/or to understand what kind of impairments can be caused in an analog frontend.
I'm a digital communications engineer and I could learn a lot about the RF frontend design and especially related impairments. Overall, the course gives a nice overview, but, for my taste, it somtimes leaves a bit too large gap between the top-level concept oriented lectures and the practical asignments. Since my analog circuit design background is quite limited and dates back more than 10 years to my first years at university, I had a somewhat hard time to put the learned theory in to practice.",0,0,Martin Fritz,90403372
