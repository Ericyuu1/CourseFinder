I will gladly put a better score once I am able to get an answer from Coursera: This course is NOT the first course to study the Specialisation track. I found one called ""introduction"" so I am not stupid, I understand that will be the first one, but what is the order for the others? I cannot find this ANYWHERE, nor am I able to contact anyone at Coursera. It's only automated responses and FAQ. I CANNOT study without doing so in the appropriate order.

37800495~COURSE!~WQMNShxYEeWP9g4JMjGIiQ,1595779848520,4,0,"I actually resented the teaching of Dr Francis at the beginning, especially when he was introducing punishment and discipline at the beginning and his informing about racism and other forms of misdealing with differences in education. I reckoned that his was only giving negative sides of punishment and said something relatively absolute about punishment, say, ""if punished, there could be a superficial sense of willingness to learn"". He only emphasised how bad punishments could do and brought up no benefits of punishment, which could mislead an idea, ""punishment is definitely not advised under any circumstances"", which is probably not what he meant. When he was talking about race, he also talked like what I would hear everyday. White students are privileged... There was only talking about how races of colours are disadvantaged, and there was no example of how white students may be disadvantaged for being white as well, say, a general prejudice against white students abusing the term ""white privilege"", which is actually happening in daily situations in Australia. He brought up many good points to reflect on, but they are the points that have been talked about, in fact, even hated against in daily lives. And one could assume that this kind of pointing out the defects without laying out the merits of something would indirectly encourage extreme behaviours such as hatred and conflict. However, as I progressed into the last bit of the course, I realised, some of these things I expected to hear actually was planned out in the latter half of the course. How ignorant I was overthinking about this at the beginning! Professor Francis' teaching is relatively comprehensive and insightful. The content is well appreciated.  The only reason why I did not mark 5 stars is because the recording quality is not as ideal as one would expect for an online lecture. ",0,1,Vannisastantin Walexandra,37800495

Overall, it proved to be a Measure of what I thought I knew about Teaching and a Tin Opener for all my underlying strengths and weaknesses but, fortunately, there was not any Warning sign for me, at least! This course deserves to be a part of Teacher’s Training that takes place at any part of the world in any form and at any level because Teachers need to understand the Philosophy of Learning rather than cultural constraints and political parameters which would always be there. ‘Learning’ is too important and universal to happen beyond all of that.A great effort and Kudos to all the Team who has put together this course and Dr. Dennis Francis for being the lighthouse and the epitome of teacher as a facilitator whose subtle and generous mannerism makes even the ‘lectures’ enjoyable! The pedagogy is very well thought of starting from the structure to the duration of all the sessions and MCQs in the Quiz that really put the learning and knowledge to the test. I tried to score maximum in all tests but had to take the last Sixth Week test many times to score a 100!Great job, I enjoyed being a part of it wholeheartedly and although I finished the SIX Week Course in TWO Weeks, it was not a Crash Course… I made most of every moment of learning, I believe!Thank you very much and all the best as I look forward to recommending it to my peers!",0,0,Manish Puranik,104985052
