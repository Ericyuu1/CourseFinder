2212112~COURSE!~TN2PygiBEeW4diIACwKO-g,1444530821492,1,0,"The ""Soul Beliefs"" course seems to try presenting things in an unbiased manner yet they cannot hide their bias.  If the intention was to hold up various beliefs in the past then try to shoot them down, they partially succeeded.  Most rational believers however could still hold onto their beliefs because the arguments were very weak.A better title for the course would be ""why there is no soul"".  That way going in a student would realize that there actually was a hidden agenda.",0,1,Tom Wood,2212112

It was a well balanced course that doesn't shove you into a particular corner but instead offers multiple viewpoints and questions for you to consider about your own personal beliefs. ,0,0,Marc Steven McClain,2652995

11104221~COURSE!~TN2PygiBEeW4diIACwKO-g,1584118714391,5,0,"The course and the entire series was very enlightening and thought provoking.  It was very well organized and raised a number of topics, explaining the inter-relationships between religion, science (both evolution and psychology), and politics.  It expanded my view of the topic and I have continued to read additional books and related articles that I likely would have skipped before this class.  Although the lectures introduced concepts behind the various religions, I would have liked learning more details; but I suppose I can do that on my own.  My only criticism of the class is that the review and grading process needs to be improved since it took over a month to get a some of the papers graded (both in session 2 and session 3); perhaps this is more of a Coursera issue than a Soul Beliefs issue?",0,0,Michael R Ruland,11104221

Rather than taking polemic positions against soul beliefs and established religions, their goal is to make clear how soul beliefs worked throughout the history and explain with a lot of examples and evidence how the evolution theory works. My only remark is that whole course could fit into two parts. That would make things easier for many users.",0,0,Emmanouil Pagiatakis,23121293
