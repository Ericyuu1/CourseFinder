I think that this was a major barrier that resulted in many people unenrolling. The video no longer matches what you need to do and the written instructions are not detailed enough. I only figured it out because other students created detailed discussion boards. Furthermore, the licensing now gives you ArcGIS Pro while all the videos and assignments are in ArcMap. This made the videos way less helpful than they could have been and resulted in the assignments being much harder to complete. Additionally,  there were people's final projects that I was unable to open because their assignment was made in ArcMap and my software is ArcGIS Pro. This meant that I graded them lower because I was unable to open their files.

93296064~COURSE!~hESqA3EhEeWIfhKr_WcYsQ,1646747568636,2,0,"This review is for 4 of the 5 courses for the specialization, not for the final course. It is promoted as for beginners, but the projects that are required are incredibly complicated and far too advanced for beginners.  Unless someone already has a strong grasp on Python, analytics and workflows, it's very easy to get overwhelmed.  When the majority of the students who post are saying that they are completely lost when trying to even figure out how to start a project, there's a problem.  And not being able to ask for explicit help just leads to frustration. The instructor is thorough but often goes through examples far too quickly and without enough explanation to make concepts clear. There aren't enough hands-on projects which could make confusing or complicated processes easier to understand.  The content is over 6 years old and there are many website links that no longer work, or the data is outdated or inaccessible.  If a student has a problem with the ArcMap software, as many posted about on the discussion forums, there is nobody to seek for help.  Contacting UC Davis led nowhere because they don't administer the software. Contacting Coursera didn't help because they didn't issue or manage the software. The instructor is no longer associated with Coursera so he can't help. Reached out to ESRI and they tried to help but didn't have answers.  If the software necessary for the class doesn't work or isn't accessible, there's little point in taking the class. Overall, this has the fundamentals for making a great beginner course, but it tries to cram too much information into a too small time frame and required projects for completion that are far above a beginner level. Unfortunately, these same concepts are expressed throughout all of the GIS offerings on Coursera so taking an alternate course likely would have the same results.",0,6,Carol Scheideman,93296064

I found the early stage quite hard going just because of housekeeping issues with how to manage .mpk files, file structure and where to store the various file types.  I realise some of this was covered in week 4, but it would still have been very helpful to have a bit of a talk or a document on opening the mpk files, managing things like home directories, default directories, linked folders, version control etc.   Seems to me quite a fundamental part of using arcGIS that needs some good discipline.Looking forward to the next course.",0,0,Oliver Powell,2098500

The course instructor gives clear explanations and is quite easy to listen to and follow.  Every lesson contains everything for a foundational knowledge of the particular topic or skill, without overloading or dragging on for too long. The lecturer is also careful to preface anything that will be gone into in a later lesson, so you never feel concerned if you see all the options available but only delve into a few.The content is well structured and the course follows an easy pace, without both too much hand holding or leaving you wondering where to go next. Having done GIS before in university, I found this was an excellent refresher to prepare me for the rest of the specialization, but that someone with relatively little knowledge could also excel.My only critical points are that there is occasionally the odd line which you need to listen to a few times, due to jargon or the odd phrase or stutter in the flow of the lesson, but overall I found it very easy to follow. Also in the reviewed assignment, the items which would be included in the marking rubric were scattered in the explanation document, so I missed them before my initial upload.",0,0,Adam Kloppenburg,43651033

Although they are optional, I'd 100% recommend doing the assignments - they're very low-stress since the instructions tell you how to do literally every step (extremely fool-proof) so you realize by the end you've successfully used tools that may have intimidated you during the lecture. Just make sure you don't mindlessly go through them; think about why what you're doing makes sense given the goals of the task. It also makes the final assignment (much less guidance and peer graded) far more doable. My one critique is the peer reviewed assignment structure. We are required to grade two assignments and also wait for our own assignment to be graded, but for a while only 1 was available for me to grade, and nobody was picking up my assignment even though (in the discussion forum) it looked like they were also waiting for a new assignment to be available for them to give feedback on. I had to manually post the link to my assignment in the forum for people to see it and review it (and of course I did the same for them). It should be faster and more automatic for peers to get assignments to grade. Also, from the discussion forum, it looked like there was a lot of ""give me a good grade and I'll give you one"" going on - may need to moderate that more or spot-check that the feedback is accurate.Overall, I was impressed by the clear teaching and I am looking forward to the next course of the specialization.",0,1,Sydney Renee Nye,104267679

This course gives you key information to get started with ArcGIS, like how to use the spatial joint, how to manipulate the attribute table and share data etc. The course information is very clear, keeps it relevant and you learn it in a very systematic order. In each week what you learn you get hands-on experiences with the practical assessment. I have done many courses at university face to face and this course is comparable to some of those courses. This course gave me the skills and confidence to make beautiful maps in ArcGIS. The only part of this course I would change is the final peer review assessment instead of submitting it and get a mark. They should have a 4-step process, first, the student should submit the map and map document like normal. Second, the peer reviewer should get a document/form that goes through step by step what check and leaves feedback if done incorrectly. Third, Then the document/ form gets returned the student who goes through it and makes the changes or if they feel the changes are unfair comment why. Then the student should Submit the document/form with comments on the changes, with the final map and map document for marking. This is a bit more work but when each student while peer-reviewing and making changes they are learning what the did wrong.
