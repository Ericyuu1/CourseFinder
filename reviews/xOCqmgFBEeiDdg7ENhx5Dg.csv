85114852~COURSE!~xOCqmgFBEeiDdg7ENhx5Dg,1621805868314,5,0,"I think about
what I learned and how I felt during the course. Obviously, this course was
very informative for me. I gained insight into my own career. Also, as a
consultant, I am thinking of using this course material in career counseling to
my clients. First of all, I liked the way the lessons were taught. I think the
lessons are considered quite global. The existence of different language
options, the use of visuals, video, listening, reading, writing and note-taking
methods make learning easier. Participants' evaluation of each other was also a
good reflection tool. On the other hand, language options can be expanded. This
will further globalize the course.I learned about
a lot about myself through the course material. First of all, I learned to have
an insight into my choices in life. There are many ways to gain insight into my
life history right now. For example: Test out options, look ahead, maintain
relationships, little personal sacrifice, intrinsic motivation.  These methods are essential for a good career
plan.Secondly, in my
career, I realized that my brain could play some fooling on me. Until now I was
a psychological counselor working in schools. The thought that I can only be
successful in schools may be a delusion in my brain. This may be a kind of
vividness bias. After all, teaching and being a student are things I've known
since my childhood. I am just discovering academics. I decided to go on this
discovery.Third,
I saw a relationship between success, identity consanance, and habitus. People
can sometimes decide according to their emotions and sometimes according to
their logic. I think the common side of success in every situation is the
result of identity consanance in the situation experienced. There may be
dissonances on the way to human identity consanance. These dissonances can
sometimes be positive and sometimes negative. The important thing is to come
out with dissonances and use it to their advantage. Moreover, habits also
affect success. Habitus such as being late for appointments, delaying things to
do, not being open to new pleasures, and being prejudiced in human relations
prevent success.Fourth, I
focused on the relationship between my skills and my personal projects. The
recommended books on the subject were good for me. So, some skills I have that
oral and written communications, critical thinking, problem solving, teamwork
and collaboration, leadhership, professionalism and work ethic, global and
interculturel fluency. But I don't think I'm very good about career management
and digital technologies. Thanks to this course, my career management skill is
better. On digital technologies, I have to work a lot.Fifth, I learned
to create a mind map like the example of Tamara. These include mind map de
skills, inluences, core projects and key experiences. Chaos theory and the
interview with Barbara Oakley also broadened my perspective. As a result, when
I look at my mind map my core personal project is this: My core personal
project is to produce my own theory in social sciences and to publish a useful
and permanent publication for humanity. There are many theories in
psychological counseling. All very special and important. But all of them have
some incomplete and criticized ones. If I can form my own theory, I think it
will make a serious contribution to the psychological counseling literature.
This core personal project requires deliberative practice rather than a
craftsman mindset. I hope I can make this happen at some point in my career.",0,3,Dilek AKÇA KOCA,85114852
