121206448~COURSE!~Frsakpd0Eea2shJAHKQhjA,1673835900076,1,0,"Thought the presentations were very interesting.  Unfortunately can't get past the first quiz, and not worth the frustration to keep trying (5 tries).  Clearly not geared to lifelong learners - frustrating because I have practiced in this field so the material isn't alien to me.  Quiz has been constructed to hinge on nuance/fine points of less significance, and from my perspective, misses the key points raised in the presentations.  Stopped the course after the first week.  Couldn't get above 66% on the quiz after 5 tries and a revisit of all the first section's material.Course could be upgraded with a few tweaks, but as it is now, is frustrating for the time spent.  Disappointing.",0,0,Thomas Arata,121206448

46877263~COURSE!~Frsakpd0Eea2shJAHKQhjA,1623341572268,1,0,"I am currently enrolled in this course but the instructor`s English level is clearly burdening my advance. Given the fact that He is Italian, It'd have been better for him and for everyone to teach the course in his own language rather than in a different language for which he he is not  enough qualified. He speaks bad and very fast, makes inconclusive sentences  and seems to be addressing to his students who might know how he is and what he implies to state. Unfortunately, the capitality of the subject does not fin a match with the teaching level. I am giving the course a star because less is not possible. ",0,5,Xavier Gonzalez,46877263

62258125~COURSE!~Frsakpd0Eea2shJAHKQhjA,1626498057560,4,0,The content is very vast and teaching was like a class room. Some difficulties felt due to pronunciation of English which is not of their mother tongue I agree. I was surprised after starting the course that it is full of all scientific  inputs and as I am from science background I took enough time to understand all the lectures and enriched my knowledge.The slides are very nice.The backdrop of the teacher should be made better and rethinking is is required how visually it will be better. Sometimes 20 min lecture was very monotonous try to make is smaller part and increase the number of lectures say for 3 class it can be made 5 etc. Overall it is full of materials. Thank you to all teachers .,0,0,Amitava Datta,62258125
1581606~COURSE!~Frsakpd0Eea2shJAHKQhjA,1590680812151,4,0,"Very good course to introduce the Nexus methodology of analysis of socio-ecological systems and its challenges. If you don't know this method of analysis, lectures can sometimes feel heavy on new terminology and theory. I would have liked to have more real case studies where the Nexus system of analysis is applied and the outcomes of its application for decision making, policy etc, as well as its success or not as a system to tackle the complexity of sustainability issues in specific real cases.The course includes as well epistemological analysis and theories, and encourages critical thinking with regard to narratives in the scientific realm and when developing quantitative research and data analysis.

59081575~COURSE!~Frsakpd0Eea2shJAHKQhjA,1621844120584,5,0,"The course delivers, I was a little apprehensive at first, because I didn't feel it was being concise enough, I felt it was being maybe a little ""ethereal"" at some points, but I am happy to say that my first impression was very mistaken, they really put everything together mid-way through in a fantastic way. I appreciate what this course teaches; it is, in my opinion, unapologetic about the fact that the Nexus approach is complex (unlike other trains of thought in sustainability and IWRM) but tackles the problem anyways and presents a useful methodology that doesn't feel disingenuous. A methodology that is truly trying to cover all the bases when it comes to analyzing complex systems. Great job! I recommend this very much.As a final note, and just because I saw a couple of people complaining about this, from my point of view there is nothing wrong with the language this course is taught in, it is perfectly understandable and at no point I felt I didn't understand what they were saying. The subtitle make mistakes here and there but if you are an English speaker you shouldn't have any problem at all.",0,0,Martin Elizalde Lecuona,59081575
