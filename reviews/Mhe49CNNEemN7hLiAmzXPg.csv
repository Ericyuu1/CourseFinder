The final project has almost no explanation for it - we are just asked to make ""a webpage and and manual"". In the end, you are peer-reviewed so your feedback can be all over the board in terms or quality (someone just commented ""g"" (just the single letter) on the project I worked for over 10 hours on. Plus, there don't seem to be a lot of people taking this class so it sometimes could take a while to get the 3 necessary reviews for the projects. Not worth it. ",0,0,Becky Blomgren,52914053

Very often I would choose fonts and colours in design work without paying much attention to finer details or knowing that there is an established body of knowledge behind them too. This course helped me to change that. Going forward, I will be using the fundamentals of colour theory, typography and the 4 design principles in everything I design for work or for personal use. I definitely think it is a good intro course into the world of graphic design and design elements. ",0,1,Prashant Bhatia,11948025
