116089823~COURSE!~HiDIabQgEeuhvApQ-8cGMw,1666569700545,4,0,"T​his is an excellent course. It is thought provoking and certainly challenged my thinking. The building of the content over the course, the questions, the guests and the resources -- they are excellent. I was hoping it would bridge some of the lack of knowledge about the business issues, such as the higher cost of distributed resources. Some statements made me groan and some resources dismiss that utilities have legitimate objections. I would wish for content that bridges the difficult job of distributing electricity with the solutions offered of energy justice advocates. Let's get specific about the limitations of technology such as battery storage and open up eyes to wonderful things such as energy efficiency and demand response. ",0,0,Robbin Christianson,116089823

84700690~COURSE!~HiDIabQgEeuhvApQ-8cGMw,1648949117724,4,0," The course was very interesting and opened my mind for new point of view.  For example, the utilities companies must have their contract reviewed , otherwise, the poorest people has not a chance to have a renewable or other source of energy and they will burden for low efficiency of the system and/or loss in profits of such companies . However, I did not like the approach concerning WASP against other racial communities.    The course, sometime, should appears a Sen. Senders (Dem - MA) and his follows speech.  We have a difference between the wealthy people and organization and the low-income persons and/or communities. The poorest cannot afford the high cost of energy, independent of gender, color (there is no different race when talking about human sapiens sapiens).   The other point that the course had not considered is that even a poor person in USA may use more energy unit per day than poor people in India or in Africa. We should balance the consumption of energy worldwide; the planet cannot afford everyone person using/consuming energy by day as one average North American living in northeast of USA consumes. We are not comment about energy efficiency, but at the end, energy waste and luxury. ",0,0,Fernando Nobrega,84700690
