12244867~COURSE!~xJrJ5XQ3EeWLqw7zlLhRzQ,1497730539600,1,0,"Disappointing. Very disappointing. Here is why:1. This comes as course 3 in a specialisation of 5. I'd expect to find here more advanced contents than in the previous 2. Instead, it goes in the opposite direction, i.e. concepts are more superficial than in previous courses. I expect a Specialisation to dive deeper as one moves on, instead with this course it looks likes it’s just going horizontally.2. The course title reads “Visual Analytics with Tableau”, but actually in most cases it reduces to a series of suggestions / best practices on how to use basic components of Tableau, not on how to do Visual Analytics. It did touch on something related to visual analytics though, e.g. table calculations, but it didn’t go any farther than just giving a definition, and provide a small example.3. The course duration is incredibly short. The contents delivered with this course could stay in one module only, in terms of quantity.4. Space for practice is virtually absent, despite the speaker continuously repeats that practicing is important. There are vague suggestions on doing practice, but no clear tasks or exercises. Why did you remove the optional questions of previous courses? Furthermore, previous courses provide many resources, e.g. blogs to read, vizzes to analyse, … Why did you remove this as well?5. The technical quality is disappointing too, and does not stand to the high level of the previous courses. There are clear signs of multiple editing. The transcription is not always appropriate. Intros and conclusions are often repeated twice!As an initial course, and if it didn’t have the technical issues, it would have been a nice and fair course.

31988377~COURSE!~xJrJ5XQ3EeWLqw7zlLhRzQ,1520695327588,2,0,"This series is facilitated by a different Instructor, who is quite knowledgeable, but is not a qualified teacher, and the quality control is completely absent. In summary, the instructor is more demo'ing Tableau than TEACHING it (very different methods/approach).  Some examples:Instructor word for word repeats himself on SEVERAL occasions (as in, reads a line from the script, then reads the same line again). This is particularly noticeable in Course 3, Week 3, where every lecture he does this. The Filtering lecture he repeats himself verbatim 3 times within a one minute span (check the transcripts).During one of his lectures, the instructor is describing a particular chart (area chart), but the chart he's showing is a different one (line chart).The assignments regularly ask students to do things that have not been taught, requiring outside research (i.e. google).  The AGG(Profit Ratio) stands out as one of the more frustrating aspects, in both Week 1 and 4.  Some of the assignments have incomplete details on what is needed to finish (specifically compared to what's displayed in the supplementary image). Students have to go out to the forums to read what students from prior sessions have posted to figure out what is required (lack of quality control)Throughout the series of courses, the same source data is used (Sales Superstore Dataset). On one of the assignments (Course 3, Week 2), it references the same dataset (by name), but the file contains different data elements. The assignment details do not tell students it's different information (with the same file name), and reading the forums, can be seen as a regular issue for students (for over 10 months).  There's no reason for this NOT to be highlighted in the Assignment.  Same for Week 4, while Profit Ratio is included in the dataset, it doesn't Agg(Profit Ratio), as displayed.The lectures are less than half as long as prior lectures (by the primary instructor), as the instructor doesn't give nearly enough detail. For calculated fields, the instructor literally reads off a list of the available formulas (that a student could read on their own) and that's the entire lesson (same applies to several lectures).  At most, he talks about one example, but rarely displays it on screen. This is what I mention above, demo'ing versus teaching, just showing that Tableau has a particular feature, not adequately teaching its possible/various uses.  There are plenty of demo videos out there (offered by Tableau), learners taking these courses are looking for more than that.Some of the quizzes have questions about details not covered in the lectures. Most of the time you can extrapolate, but it's guessing rather than having been taught specific information.Almost every lecture video starts with a recap of the prior video and ends with a foreshadowing of what's next.  On 3 minute videos, there's no need to spend over a minute on that; most students are likely going from one to the next in quick succession.  Instead of saying things like ""try and explore on your own"", offer optional practice assignments or specific configurations to try.  As a learner, I want to practice these things, to figure out various options and functionality, guidance on variations are much more helpful than content-less prompt to explore on our own.  I have mixed feelings about the example visual being provided with the assignments.  Without them, I likely would not have been able to produce anything compared to what is being asked.  With them, I found myself just looking at it and copying the layout/configurations to make sure I got it right.  I didn't feel the lectures adequately prepared me for most of the assignments (without the finished product in front of me).  ",0,10,Mark Alton,31988377

21096182~COURSE!~xJrJ5XQ3EeWLqw7zlLhRzQ,1595602160246,3,0,"I was probably closer to a 3.5. I think this course was the weakest out the three I've taken so far in the UC-Davis Tableau specialization. There just wasn't a lot of material taught. The video lectures are incredibly short (2-3 minutes) and the final 30 seconds of each is spent with an overly repetitive recap of what's been learned so far. When you only give instruction for 1-2 minutes, it seems unnecessary to have the recap. In terms of the content presented, I expected more in-depth examples and explanations. If you are teaching calculated fields, spend some time going over the syntax and provide multiple examples. Show us what happens to the output if you alter segments of the syntax. Overall, I'm finding this Tableau specialization spends too much time on visualization theory and not enough time on actual Tableau buttonology. I want to learn the ""ins and outs"" of the software, so I can make it do what I want it to do. I feel many of the Free tutorials on the Tableau website provide better instruction on the actual mechanics. On top of that, too many of the exercises are fraught with unclear directions, inconsistent data files (why do the superstore datasets keep changing?), and in several instances, students are asked to perform a task that doesn't get introduced until a later chapter. It makes everything seem hastily put together. Many of the discussion forums have pointed out these problems, but seeing as none of have been fixed and students are still writing about the same issues 3 years after first pointing them out, I'd say there is no active participation from the course creators or lecturers.

But it's just my thoughts!2) Some of the exercises (map specific) are designed with US in mind. Note that if you are in another country (like me), the default locale settings will not create the US map by default and you will need to manually override locale in Tableau.
