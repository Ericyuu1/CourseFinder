33485840~COURSE!~wJkiuf1cEeis_Ar3WWS1OA,1628298679123,3,0,"This is an excellent course for anyone in finance, especially Portfolio and Asset Management professions.  This particular segment is the 2nd of 4 parts of the ""Investment Management with Python and Machine Learning Specialization"".  Unfortunately, the code instructor dropped the ball in this part (compared to the first, ""Introduction to Portfolio Construction and Analysis with Python"").  The coding lab sessions were app 1/3 the length of Part 1, but the code is much more challenging in Part 2 (and more, not less, instruction is necessary).   The instructor briefly skims over a previously completed python workbook, then asks the student to ""play around with the code"" in order to fully comprehend it.  This is rather insulting to many - as indicated by Discussion Forum Comments.  Also, the quizzes contain a number of mismatches between the Python Function library (known as the Edhec Risk Kit) 

and the questions.  The person responsible for answering student questions barely does so with adequate thoroughness and has failed to update much of his erroneous suggestions.  I recommend the original instructors commit to fixing the many holes here, and consider assigning a more helpful person to the Discussion Forum - Emanuelle doesn't cut it. The Python code instructor also should re-record videos for this section - so that we don't need to ""play around with his code"" in order to understand it.
