It's happy to see quizes as performance evaluation in comparison with peer reviews from previous specialization course. However I lack Databricks features usage and explanations (MlFlow expecially). Also Databricks runtime used during course preparation is no longer available for selection as cluster configuration - it results in different answers for specific questions (it was very painful with K-Means clustering - I just had other ordering cluster labels)",0,2,Dzmitry Syrakvash,830252
