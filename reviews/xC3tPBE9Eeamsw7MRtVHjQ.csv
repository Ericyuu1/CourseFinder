17384408~COURSE!~xC3tPBE9Eeamsw7MRtVHjQ,1639065577570,1,0,"The subject of the course is great and is probably one of the few dealing with TEM, thus for me is recommendable and I would like to congratulate the professors. However, the course structure makes it very difficult to complete, the questionaries often have questions which are explained on the following sections and “reviewed by other classmates“ activities take too much time to get a review (literally months). Very difficult to complete.",0,2,Antonio Vázquez López,17384408

This course will be very useful in analyzing DPs and images. However, added course materials related to adjusting microscopic variables to arrive at different DPs and images would have made this a comprehensive course, just enough to get started on practically operating TEM and its different modes.

It really helped me fill the knowledge gap which resulted from disruption of education due to COVID while I was pursuing my bachelors degree. Many of my old concepts were reinforced and a lot of concepts and skills have been learnt. I am especially thankful to Ms. Cecile and Mr. Duncan, both of them delivered the course with full dedication. I am also thankful to Coursera Team for giving me opportunity to avail the financial aid, without which I couldn't achieve this certification.

The difficulty of the course increased gradually towards the end of the program. Though adequate external resources were included in the course, I felt that some of the basic concepts could have been explained in the lecture videos. Overall the course was interesting and engaging with all its lectures, exercises, quizzes, and assignments. The instructors actively responded to doubts with hints and clarifications.",0,1,Aswin Suresh,39390989
