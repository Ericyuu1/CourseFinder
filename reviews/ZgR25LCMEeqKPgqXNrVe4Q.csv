Usually, there are multiple people with expertise from different areas. I personally didn’t like the tests because first of all, I found the introduction too short. I couldn’t get some questions, like we didn’t discuss it and therefore I lost any motivation to do them properly. Also, it was very American-centred. I had to google some brands because here in Europe we don’t have them which took additional time. I would prefer to have examples with well know brands everywhere, not only in the US.Peer review is great but I never received a detailed feedback… I understand people don’t want to spend time but it’s disappointing.

I came away with the information I hoped to get out of the course, including a rigorous framework with which to evaluate product opportunities.With that said, the instruction left a lot to be desired. I'll highlight two areas that could be improved, although there are more. First is the instruction format. Most of the instruction is verbal, meaning that there are few visuals. The instructor is a talking head, reading from a script. It's difficult to process that much verbal information and remain focused on the content.Second is the lack of context. The instructor is not good at setting context or explaining concepts at a high level before diving into details and using lots of jargon. What's the goal of what we're learning? Why are we doing it in the first place? For those who don't know the jargon, stop and explain it. And for those whose first language is not English, slow down.For example, for the TAM/SAM/SOM exercise , the instructor gave a very short definition of each one without explaining why they're important. When it came time to explain our homework, she read from a template she'd put together of TAM/SAM/SOM calculations, including some assumptions that weren't even well defined in the analysis - she didn't say why she was using these numbers or how she'd arrived at them. When I went to grade other students' answers it was clear many did not fully understand the exercise. They were copying her template and changing the numbers without understanding the goal.The course was worthwhile for me, but I definitely left frustrated by the format and the teaching.

Less focus on split screen and more focus on the material presented.  There were times it was hard to see the demo materials because it was so small on the screen due to split screen.  For example the section on Competitive Analysis, the spreadsheet was really small on the screen and it made it difficult to follow along. 3.

Let me explain what I mean.First, let me point out the sequence that the course was designed in. Customer Personas --- Customer Journeys -- Customer Acquisition Funnel --- PRDs and PRs --- MVP -- TAM , SAM and SOM.I mean this is a pretty good structure but I think no the best one.For example, in my head - I was trying to understand the course in the following way. As the first step, of course yes, we would want to learn about Customer Personas. And, that made complete sense. Because of  course, that is where you would want to start while coming up with a new product, right? You would want to understand the ""WHO"" of the product first. And, the next lesson that we studied after this was about Customer Journeys and Customer Acquisition Funnel. But, I think here itself it would make more sense to study about TAM, SAM, and SOM. Because, it is important that we are understanding these metrics before we build MVP, right? Why go through the process of even writing a single line of code if you are not sure about your TAM SAM SOM?And, then I would go into learning about customer journeys and PRDs together. Because that is when you start building the product and creating PRDs makes most sense when you are building it. PRDs are ""HOW"" of the product.And now that MVP is ready and validated, we need to sell the product. And that is when, Customer Acquisition Funnel and b2b sales come in. I mean I don't want to teach you how to teach. I am pretty sure you have done much more research on this and are obviously highly qualified.

In general, this is certainly a course that I would recommend to anyone interested in knowing about and becoming a PM. On the other hand, I'm pretty sure that the instructor and the staff don't know about learning design. 

The course has a good mix of theoretical, real-world examples, and practice - that was really good! The real-world examples were well chosen and pertinent to the topic in the question. They were great, and I would state the instructor definitely went to the last mile with detailed examples instead of high-level ones usually found in courses (for example, on the Blue vs. Samson competitive analysis). Also, the exercises demand students to be really active, with the correct dose of challenge. Finally, the weakest point lies in the theoretical content, where almost 100% of them were taught while showing the instructor in front of the camera, without any supplementary material which would help students to have a visual representation and would help to follow the explanation (some simple bullet points would make the difference to follow along).

I have learned a lot, from the PM-world terms and definitions, common traps, the role, the tools, the skills. Also, I had some insights along the way.

The videos and examples used have been insightful, and captivating. I enjoyed discovering the nuts and bolts of various companies I am familiar with. I have also discovered that I gravitate to gathering competitive intelligence, writing the PR statements and drawing up customer personas - in that order. The TAM, SAM and SOM exercise was a little anxiety inducing, especially when I couldnt find the information I needed to validate my insights or assumptions. I am/was determined to use the product I was developing for each assignment, and getting information for some of the exercises was challenging. the other stumbling block were the peer graded assignments. There was a technical issue with one submission, and it kept on getting marked as 0 because the grader couldnt open the link. Having to resubmit it 3 times was not fun. The other issue was another grader who gave me a positive comment on my submission, like... great work, but then promptly selected 0 for every question - I had to resubmit that one too. Besides the above stumbling blocks, I think another way to improve the course would be to get actual PMs to comment on assignment submissions, to let us know how were doing.

Another training I did was exactly the same and this waiting time sometimes is frustrating. I do not have a full solution for that ;) but I would propose something around named ""tutors"" or mentors, people that offer themselves as reviewers. This would allow the one providing the course to enable a threshold that could mark work as done in case it takes more than X hours for someone to get someone elses work. I do understand that in your model See one, Do one, review one it is very important to have this review exercise ... but it could improve user experience. 2- more resources please :) I loved reading the article provided in this course and sometimes for a beginner it can be challenging to search ourselves for good and right articles to read.

Specialization that was prepared and
lead by Nancy Wang, a Head of Product at Amazon (AWS), who also was a Product
Manager at Google and is a CEO and Founder of Advancing Women in Product
(AWIP). Nancy shares her knowledge gained throughout her career in those extremely
successful companies.The specialization is a combo of 4 courses to learn product
management from different perspectives: customer obsession, market sizing,
competitive analyses, success metrics (like KPIs, OKRs, North Stars, A/B/n
tests, NPS, CSAT, CES, cohort analyses, LTV, pricing, and financials), etc.The big advantage of this course is it helps you to create your
own portfolio through studying all 4 courses by developing your own product
using real-life PM tasks during product management lifecycle from inception
till launch. Each task takes about an hour. This work is peer-reviewed and you
get real feedback. Even though it is quite time-consuming to do those practical
assignments and peer review assignments of other students, it helps to get
practical knowledge and learn things by doing, which is especially extremely
important for folks who want a transition to a PM role and have no real
experience yet. Another advantage is that you get trained using real PM
interview questions. Nancy shares questions from giants like Amazon, Google,
Facebook, and Microsoft and helps to master their Behavioral, Product Design,
Strategy, Estimation, and Technical interview questions.Also, it was super useful to listen to interviews and panels
that Nancy did with successful senior Product Managers and Leaders in Product
where they shared their experience, insights, and tips for PM career, things
they are looking for in PM candidates. On top of that Nancy shares great sources for networking to
advance your career as a Product Manager.I highly recommend every Product Manager to take this up!!Thank you to Nancy Wang and the rest of #AWIP for putting this course together!I learned so much that I am excited to take into my current and
