It says you need to make a component diagram of an application, then says to install Android Studio and look over an app's code, which implies you have to make a diagram of the Android app. I had been working on it for an hour before I noticed the real instructions at the very bottom of the page, which do not actually require you to run the app or really look at the source code at all; the whole app is just one single component in the diagram. I could understand making it optional or recommended, but please just make the instructions say what to do.

I  found the part with the Diagrams very helpful and the part with the  different architectural styles. Also the ATAM Method is a good method  for architecture but in the real world it's seldom used as is....usually  there's no time for it. It should become a company process to do the  ATAM for each product developed in order to benefit from it. But in such  a fast moving world usually nobody does it. I would have liked more  in-depth exercises with the ATAM method since I feel I have just  scratched the surface. Then I could adapt the ATAM to my company's  process to enforce this method. There's an idea for a new course :)2. If  you had a friend just starting this course, what advice would you give  regarding the content of this course in particular, or the general  nature of finding success in online learning?I would advise him  to have at least 3 years of real-world programming experience before  beginning this course. Otherwise it's no use since a lot of very  complicated topics were covered very very quickly and if you do not have  the background then you probably won't understand very much. Or you  think you will ""get it"" but in fact there are a ton of aspects to cover  for each topic (See architectural styles). And yes, you do have to do a  lot of research on your own though (myself included) I am too lazy for  that. I think the course could expand on topics such as that mentioned  at point 1)  OH AND BY THE WAY: letting people review your work and giving you grades  while they have not finished their own assignments and seeing the  correct solution is a poorly inspired decision. I could grade other  people while I still didn't get a grade myself nor seen the final  solution to an exercise. Please take this into account.
