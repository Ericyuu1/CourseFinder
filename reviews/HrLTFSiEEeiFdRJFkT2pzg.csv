It I cannot listen to him for hours adding extra syllables to words or leaving consonants out of words.  Common examples..

It was bad enough, that it distracted me from following the lecture. Furthermore, there were some glaring typo's in the home work assignments.

16214764~COURSE!~HrLTFSiEEeiFdRJFkT2pzg,1582809453421,3,0,"After spending ages online trying to understand d3.js, I came across this course. The d3 library is quite difficult to understand and the available documentation is very dense. This course does an excellent job of providing an overview of how d3.js works. I particularly liked that the programming assignments that guided the student through successive steps in quite a complex data visualisation. However, there are also some limitations to the usefulness of the course. First, I was missing access to the course materials. I like to annotate the lecture slides and refer back to them, e.g. when working through the assignments. Going through the videos is much more cumbersome. Second, the instructor's English is sometimes difficult to follow. It doesn't help that the subtitles are frequently completely wrong. Despite these small limitations, I would recommend the course to anyone interested in getting a thorough introduction to d3. ",0,0,Joe Bathelt,16214764

It's a lot to cover and I think a great effort is made by the instructor to make those concepts easy to understand to anyone with no prior experience in programming. I find it a little boring for someone who has some experience working with d3.js.

Only for people not familiar to Javascript would find difficulties in the very beginning to understand why some given codes write in that way (i.g. the OR logic operator in data.reduce function) it did explain afterwards in week3/4.
