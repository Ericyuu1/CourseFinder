The lab is not very well structured and leaves a lot up to the student to figure out.  Likely many students never figure it out.  There are some issues in getting some of the lab components in a timely manner,  so I'd order them asap.  I'd still recommend the course, but I'd hope these get cleaned up to help future students.
