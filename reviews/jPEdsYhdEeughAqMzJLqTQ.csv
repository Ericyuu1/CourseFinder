76495190~COURSE!~jPEdsYhdEeughAqMzJLqTQ,1641718562959,1,0,"Unfortunately, this feels like one big advertisement for SoFi services.  Every supplement and reading assignment is from their website and it just didn't teach me anything.",0,0,Laura Camacho,76495190
26126314~COURSE!~jPEdsYhdEeughAqMzJLqTQ,1621436211836,2,0,"Overall the course is as expected, a decent introduction to start with improving your own personal finance. Pro: The course provides quite some useful information and recommendationsCons: (1) The videos can be improved substantially (I would recommend watching it at 1.25 - 1.5x; The eye movement to read the script is very distracting; A couple of videos have slight audio problems). (2) Almost all of the reading material is accessed through hyperlinks to SoFi's websites which makes it kind of pointless to follow this course, not to mention that this content is not ""course"" quality. (3) Many points discussed are associated with the US laws and regulations which make it less relevant, if not irrelevant, for individuals following this course and not from U.S.Possible Improvement: Addition of case studies and real life examples would make this course quite interactive and interesting in my opinion.",0,8,Asiman Dash,26126314
115027967~COURSE!~jPEdsYhdEeughAqMzJLqTQ,1665443091389,3,0,"B​etween the videos and reading materials, some of the information is repeated several times.  I just kinda wish it were more streamlined because I am writing notes. I just feel like it could be more effective if streamlined and perhaps include more charts and incorporate the use of flowcharts to keep it interesting.

It was slightly frustrating with the video transcript errors... but hugely aggravating when it came to the tests.  There were several instances where the answers provided did not answer the question that was asked.  It would also be helpful to know when more than one answer is to actually be selected (i.e. ""Select all that apply"") since one answer is the common scenario.

I am one to aim for the 100% grade.  With the errors in the quizzes (including a module quiz), I purposely went back and provided the wrong answer to get the 100% since selecting the correct answer reflected a lower grade.  This is all due to the errors in the quiz.  So, the transcripts were frustrating at times... but to have incorrect quiz templates is an issue that needs to be resolved.  

I do hope that as I move on to the second course that these issues are not present.

One more thing of note.  It really seems like there is no instructor overseeing the class since I am not the only one that has posted in the discussions regarding the errors.  I have also submitted through the discussion group various questions myself that I would have assumed someone other than another student would have answered.

I do hope that these issues will be looked into.  I did contact support regarding the module quiz errors.  I actually copied a pasted a word document with all of the details.  Upon submitting it, the format within the support comment box was not formatted but all of the info was still there, in detail, if they actually read it.  They later wanted me to send screenshots of that same info.  I did not.  I had already moved forward in my course work beyond all of the issues I had previously submitted.",0,0,Deborah Elam,115027967
