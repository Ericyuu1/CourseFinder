1514604~COURSE!~aW3yZHFpEeusSA6p9_DaGQ,1651432776015,1,0,"The class fails to teach most of what it asks for the assignments. In the requirements, only a basic understanding of R was  noted, while in reality most of the assignments require you to have an, at least, intermediate understanding of R and how different R libraries work. What's worst is that none is this is really taught, but really it just feels as a very shallow, incomplete, guidethrough of 10% of the whole process. Would not recommend this course for someone who is not following the MSDS degree. You will not learn anything other than opening an R markdown.",0,3,Luis Eduardo Vivar,1514604

If one is taking this course as part of an MSDS Degree, please familiarize yourself with some R programming before working on projects.",0,6,Kashan Ahmed,693993
40253877~COURSE!~aW3yZHFpEeusSA6p9_DaGQ,1623114913252,4,0,"Good course, with broad overview and several specific discussions from people working in the field. My only issue is that week 3 seems to assume prior experience with R; just a little bit more support (""go here to install R"", ""here's a quick tutorial on tidyverse"") would make it much easier to reach the level necessary for understanding the lectures and project.",0,1,Ran Brynn Reiff,40253877
