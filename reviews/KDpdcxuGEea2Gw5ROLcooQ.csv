35263302~COURSE!~KDpdcxuGEea2Gw5ROLcooQ,1615852881191,1,0,"Same criticism applies that I already had for the Parallel course:The presentation is annoying, due to the use of a pen on a glass board.The worst part is the use of the PCDP library, which is to be imported statically (if you don't like Java's object focus, then why don't you choose another programming language instead? I'm anyway not convinced that Java has particularly good support for concurrency, compared with C# or C++, so that really doesn't make sense to me...). Professor Sarkar invents some abstract notation and suggests his own library to make you write code that, through the static import, looks just like your theoretical notation. Okay, but that's not what programming is about, that's like teaching machine learning by showing you how to use sklearn, rather than covering the underlying algorithms (except that the concepts presented in this course are much more trivial than machine learning algorithms... and the course doesn't even have depth, don't expect e.g. that it tells you what the difference between a Hoare and a Mesa monitor is!). Maybe it would make sense if you teach how the library implements these things, but the way this course is delivered it really amounts to a horrible presentation of some theoretical ideas with some toy exercises, and you can almost delete the ""in Java"" part.",0,1,Jakob Ullmann,35263302

Code and tests quality is poor in my opinion.I would consider it as a overview of possible approaches, not a course. Assigments could be frustating because outcome is sometimes non-deterministic (I wasted few hours of my time because of this, it turned out that my solution was fine). Sometimes given examples are not following Java documentation in details. They could not work in corner cases. It should not be the case in the course made by professionals. Compared to the other courses I took authors of this one did not put much effort in preparing good materials and exercises. Course can by challenging by means of standing frustration assigments could give you. And in my opinion not because it is hard to pass them and they are demanding. It is because they are not properly prepared.I have mixed feeling about specializations. This topic can be hard.
