I was distracted by the overuse of morph cuts and sound effects embedded in the PowerPoint lectures. Also, the lecture materials needs to be chunked even more, since there are a lot of lectures that last longer than 12 to 15 minutes. One piece of advise, I would like to see the professor read a script of his lectures instead of adlib and/or improvising the material. Writing scripts to his lecture material will definitely tighten up the time issue in his lectures, and will have better flow and seamless pedagogy when delivering information to students. One cannot use the same rules for teaching in a traditional lecture hall for online education. They are apples and oranges.",0,12,Jonathon Duncan,3201763

Little did I expect that after the brilliant  Microeconomics (Firm Level Economics) course it will become such a chore  to get through.There are multiple issues with this course:1,  The presentation style: whereas in most courses you get to engage with  the presenter, here there is too much screen time for not well edited,  overly verbose slides that just get read out by the Professor. So it's a  double distraction...you just keep staring at the same text as he  mumbles on. I put it to 1.5x speed just to get through faster (and I'm  taking notes on paper, still not too fast)2, The material is not  very well structured: in the first lesson I thought, we have a lot of  definitions to get through...but it just keeps going like a huge,  growing list of unstructured ""stuff"" the whole time. There is no  weighting of higher level concepts, just a flood of information. Maybe  also doesn't help that the videos are longer than the usual Coursera  lesson(18-20 minutes vs 6-7 minutes) without much rhythm to them. So I  just ended up watching a week's videos then from the notes tried to  piece it together into a cohesive point.3, Narrow minded look:  I'm also not sure if forcing the Keynesian thinking all across the  course in such tedious detail (and wasting time on useless, incoherent  views about politics affecting economics) is more useful than mentioning  other alternatives like the AD/AS model, neoclassical model, Money View  (great course on Coursera, highly recommended!) or just in general open  up from the dogma and try to make sure students understand that they're  all modeling the same economic reality with different tools.The good:The quizes make you think and force some usage of the otherwise dry material.The  assigments are not bad but a bit on the simple side but unfortunately  on Coursera longer submissions cannot be expected to be properly  reviewed anyways.Unless you really have to (as specialisation or  iMBA requirement), I wouldn't recommend taking this course, you're  better off reading a book (Theory and Applications of Macroeconomics or  the OPENSTAX books - both free) or watch the (free) Khan Academy course,  while they cover the same material (and more), they're much more  engaging.This was the hardest course for me to follow (not the  content, the format) until I put it on hold and learned the material  from other sources to come back and finish.Although I really like Coursera and the format/content it offers, this one I cannot recommend.
