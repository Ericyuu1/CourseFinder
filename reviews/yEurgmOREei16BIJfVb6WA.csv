Following along with an AWS RHEL instance was impossible for all but the most basic functions.It appears that the information in this class was valid as of 2015-2016, and hasn't been updated since. Because most commands are provided in a written table format without context, I learned the most by Googling the topics being covered and going from there.I don't know who the intended audience for this class is, but it isn't amateur Python developers.",0,2,Walter Boles,24184981

Many times as developers, we think being in computer science means to write programs.  While this is a huge part, it ultimately means nothing if you do not know how it gets executed and how to execute it across a network.
