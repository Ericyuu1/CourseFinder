Anyone in a business program or a working professional will be very thankful that they took statistics with Professor TAghaboni-Dutta.  She is a remarkable teacher and consistently ranks as one of Illinois' best Professors.   The two class sessions break down statistics into easy-to-understand lessons.  Professor Taghaboni-Dutta incorporates contemporary interesting problems and issues into her lessons, which make statistics much more interesting!.  Another feature of this class, which I considered a wonderful value, are her extra instructional videos showing how to use Excel to solve statistics problems.  These videos are better than anything else I've found.  I'm serious, even MSFT doesn't have instructional videos that are as good and easy to understand as the ones in this class.  If they were posted on You-Tube, she'd probably get sponsors quickly. I don't mean to sound like a cheerleader, but I know what it is like to take Statistics from a bad teacher.  I took Statistics a long time ago, before Excel existed.  I remember trying to understand a professor who spent all of her time writing out proofs and never answering questions.   It was one of the most frustrating depressing classes of my undergraduate experience.    Professor Taghaboni-Dutta's classes are enjoyable and  educational.
