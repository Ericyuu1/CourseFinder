37090905~COURSE!~uIroEhfpEeiB3A7OOgvs1g,1543214905234,1,0,"Aside from focusing more on which buttons to push and settings to change in Photoshop or Unity (which are admittedly useful tidbits) the course doesn't teach much in terms of skills or theory. I had to learn the skills on my own. Mostly what I got was a list of assignments so I didn't have to wonder what I should work on each day. @Pixel_Dailies on Twitter can do that too.As soon as I watched the second video I realized that this course was just cobbled together from pre-existing courses and that the parts were not originally meant to go together. If the only result was comments like ""last time you learned [thing they haven't coverered]"" it'd be awkward, but fine. But then they have conflicting assignment details in the videos vs the written course material and that confusion can lead to a lot of wasted time or failing to complete an assignment properly. Annoying as that is, it is not the worst part of this course. That would be the pacing. Week one: draw a single 32x32 sprite. Week two: draw at least 9 of those plus  a huge background painting, which is hard enough, but then make sure it tiles too! Week 3: back to a single sprite, with a reasonable challenge increase from week 1. Week 4 do a bunch of animations with minimal animation instruction. I hope you've animated before! Week 5: a bunch more animation and new character designs and polish up all the older stuff you did and AAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!I realize it was a free MOOC, so I shouldn't expect too much, but you can do better for free. Google: Pixel Art Academy, Pedro Medeiros, Achebit, Heartbeast for a good start. Happy Pixeling!",0,22,Tim Sormin,37090905
2762539~COURSE!~uIroEhfpEeiB3A7OOgvs1g,1540488137054,1,0,"I'm not normally a harsh person.  Even when I'm saying something negative I try very hard to keep my emotions in check and see the other side as someone close to me; as someone needing my help to know what they're doing wrong so that they have the tools they need to improve.  I try to be as kind as possible.  However, this time I just can't give a review like that.  I can find no reason, even through a mistake, that someone with a real desire to teach could make such a course.I have no idea who this course is meant to be helpful to.  The more difficult assignments would only be able to be completed by someone with a lot of experience, but the videos were clearly supposed to be for beginners.  Saying that, however, implies that the videos were good for beginners, but sadly this isn't true in the slightest.  They often presented material that was incomplete and often highly misleading to the point of being more damaging to a beginner's ability than an outright lie.  They spent too much time on things that weren't very relevant, and completely glossed over or skipped things that were very important.  It's such a bad course that it's making me angry for the sake of all the others who are duped into thinking they're going to get something useful out of this.   Overall my impression of their abilities is passable in artist skills, beginners at pixel artist skills, and con artists as teachers.  I wouldn't be surprised if they aren't artists at all, and are actually programmers who wish they could be teaching Unity.  Either they're trying the ""fake it till you make it"" method of teaching and can't do better, or they felt forced to do this and phoned it in.  It's disgraceful.  The University of Michigan should think more carefully about the way they're presenting themselves as a school, and not just give us the dregs that they know they shouldn't charge money for.If anyone actually wants to learn Pixel Art, I suggest going to Pixel Joint or Lowspec and getting information from real tutorials, real experts, and real feedback.  Plus, it'll be completely free and without the pressure of a time limit.  This course, however, is a waste of time.",0,17,Lanea Zimmerman,2762539

90607769~COURSE!~uIroEhfpEeiB3A7OOgvs1g,1638591273758,3,0,"A​s a complete novice with regards to pixel art (aside from an abundant fascination with the craft and, of course, games that employ the art style) I can't thank MSU and Professors Dennis and Guimaraes enough for allowing me to tap into my potential and finally take the first step towards achieving what may as well be a lifelong dream of mine; creating art for (and eventually developing) video games. H​earing references to things like the Super Nintendo or Game Boy (the original monochrome sprite of Pikachu was an unexpected surprise!) just made me all giddy, knowing that video games were finally, finally, a part of my work and not just a means of ""goofing off"" anymore. T​he course is adequately detailed, enjoyable to watch/listen along with, and really well-rounded in the techniques it sets out to teach in such a relatively short amount of time; however, nothing is perfect, and I do feel like PAVG has room to improve despite its smaller-than-average timeframe. The main problem is, without a doubt, the content of the video ""lectures."" Don't get me wrong, the videos were the de-facto tool I had opened next to my Photoshop window whenever I worked, but they either were way too long (for the more traditional art techniques taught by Prof. Guimaraes) or absolutely too short (as was the case with Prof. Dennis's actual Pixel Art tutorials) with no real in-between. I understand that as an art course at its core, traditional art concepts such as color theory and character design are not just useful, but essential; that said, the fact that the videos focused on them -- with no application directly applied to Pixel Art aside from a passing mention by Prof. Dennis later on -- took up more than half of the amount of time spent watching the instructory videos felt bizarre. By comparison, Prof. Dennis's tutorials, if I'm not mistaken, rarely surpassed a solid five minutes, if ever. As such, Prof. Dennis's videos felt rushed and shallow in their execution, and the constant use of fast-forward combined with somewhat awkward pauses got frustrating at many points. Having us see the process without straight-out telling us the step-by-step points of it would be fine, but way more often than not, Prof. Dennis would have already drawn something richly detailed out in the span of (literally, in the character tutorial's case) five seconds, leaving me frankly stunned and repeatedly rewinding the last few seconds just to see/ensure if I was doing things correctly. As something that regards itself as a beginner-friendly and ""no-prior-experience-needed"" introductory course, (there's even an Introduction to Photoshop video in Week 1) the actual getting down to work each week just served as massive difficulty spikes. Compounding all of this was the lack of actual grading by the Professors themselves; every assignment submission from start to finish is only reviewed and graded by your peers. I have no doubt that we all have a clear understanding of the requirements of the assignments, but considering pursuing this course as a means of a first-step towards entry into such a sprawling industry, not having any feedback from the professionals made some of my work (despite getting perfect scores most times!) feel lesser and almost cheap. I'm by no means pefect -- again, I may as well be a complete amateur -- but I still feel like something being graded as an 8/8 should be at least verified by the people who are actually teaching us this content. I​ take all of this into consideration to say, to anyone considering taking this course, you should still come on in and go for it. I stress the fact that prior to these past five weeks, I didn't know anything about designing pixel art besides zooming all the way into a Photoshop drawing and going pixel-by-pixel, and now I type this with an entire platformer's scene animated in Unity. This course can and will teach you amazing things that are equally as amazing to see coming to life by your own hand, but that's the caveat as well as the strength of this course; you need to be confident in your own capabilities, because you're ultimately on your own aside from a few minutes of video tutorials that speed by.",0,2,Hunter Fine,90607769
