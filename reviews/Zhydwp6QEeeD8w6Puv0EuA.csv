However, there are too many issues with the course.The Sketchup version used in the videos is outdated. This is manageable if you look up the help document.There are many errors in the graded quizzes. Some questions are poorly written, as English is not the instructors' first language, to the extent that you need to guess their meanings.The course is not being managed by anyone. The last time the moderators replied to any thread in the forum was 3 years ago.Grading relies completely on peer reviews. There are currently only a handful of students pursuing this course. You probably have to wait months for your assignment to receive enough reviews to pass.Some students might give you unfair random marks and leave no comment. Some might give you a fail just because they have no idea of how to open your file with their version of the software. Coursera support is not helpful in solving this. They would just advise you to re-submit, wait and try your luck again.I also found a few students plagiarising others' works and there is no course moderator to deal with this.Coursera says they are trusting that everyone is following the Code of Conduct. Apparently, not everyone is trustworthy.Anyway, this course if free to enroll and its content quite simple. Try it if you have some time to kill.",0,15,Howie Wang,45480487

That said, though not entirely irrelevant to CADding, the quiz covers aspects not taught in the instruction. To add to this, the grammar and the way the questions are asked are confusing. This course will greatly benefit from professional translation services for the quizzes. On several of the questions I took guesses as to what was being asked of me, most of the time I got those answers wrong. I earned a 63% on course that was pretty rudimentary in what was taught. I don't trust that I'm entirely accountable for such a low score.Because of this I am unenrolling from this course. I have already begun a course elsewhere that seems to be much more intuitive and more than likely a better place for my learning. Should this course redesign it's use of language in it's quizzes, I will be very interested in starting the course again. Like I said, I appreciate the instructor, but the quizzes need some quality control.Thank you for what I have been able to take away with me.
