But I'm generally a better person for having taken pursued this topic. I look forward to taking Anti-Racism III from CU Boulder via Coursera when it becomes available. I quite enjoyed Shawn O'Neal and Dr Jennifer Ho as instructors of record. They're engaging, knowledgeable, organized, precise, and they've engaged a nice selection of guest speakers for the various components of the course. Well done!",0,2,Richard Kim Millsap,21039919

I highly reccomend doing the specialization ( 3 part series of Anti-Racism) its worth the time and you learn alot. It does not really feel like a class, not like what you imagine when you think of school work. it is easy to understand, easy to  do the work, you dont have to stress over it which makes learning the content so much easier. on to number 3 i go.
