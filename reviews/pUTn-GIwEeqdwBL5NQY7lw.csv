75569937~COURSE!~pUTn-GIwEeqdwBL5NQY7lw,1646832393402,1,0,This was one of the best courses ever attended.,0,0,anyango emmanuel,75569937
25447390~COURSE!~pUTn-GIwEeqdwBL5NQY7lw,1626073460998,1,0,"The videos lack depth: the instructor tends to speed through many key topics without giving proper definitions and examples. A good example is the Week 3 video explaining 'falsetto': it was 42 seconds long, and the definition given likened falsetto to the whistle register. This is not the widely accepted definition of these key terms and will only lead to confusion. Same goes for the video on 'belting', which has a whopping running time of 19 seconds.

To sum things up: Week 1 contains 4 video lessons, with a total of 15 mins; Week 2 has 3 videos, total of 9 mins; Week 3 has 3 videos, total of 3 mins; Week 4 has 4 videos, total of 12 mins. That's 39 mins of video content for the entire course - certainly not worth it in my view.

The videos are interspersed with reading content, but also quite poor in proper theory, and not a large amount of content overall.

After going through the first 2 weeks of content and some of week 3, I gave up because I felt like I wasn't gaining anything useful.",0,4,Leewyn Jacobs,25447390

56959087~COURSE!~pUTn-GIwEeqdwBL5NQY7lw,1594484280540,1,0,"The course's feedback is exclusively dependent on peer review. Unfortunately in this case there were some consistent problems with that - peers just didn't do it; they didn't follow the rubric in giving feedback; or they were too simplistic in feedback, e.g. ""good job."" As a result it was impossible to create building blocks of learning or develop your singing voice beyond what you started with. Finally, the instructor's choice of music was boring, uninspiring and unfamiliar.",0,9,Stephanie Matteis,56959087
37304206~COURSE!~pUTn-GIwEeqdwBL5NQY7lw,1593042779390,1,0,"Only 1 star I'm afraid. I felt the teacher was going through the motions, and very much a singer of a certain style which did not chime with me. The course content was at times muddy and not constructively put together. The choice of sample songs to work on was limited and repeated each week. The final week did not require singing to be assessed. I came out of it with very little new information and no new abilities or confidence.",0,4,Richard Steel,37304206
15328162~COURSE!~pUTn-GIwEeqdwBL5NQY7lw,1659665131661,2,0,It's the weakest course in the specialization. The instructor seems extremely talented but unable to explain clearly concepts with clarity. The course feels unstructured and it's hard to follow overall.,0,0,Carlos Alberto Morales R,15328162
6620016~COURSE!~pUTn-GIwEeqdwBL5NQY7lw,1616459334942,2,0,"A ""curate's egg"" of a course. Good in parts but... The lecturer herself is obviously a capable singer, but trying to translate that across to helping you develop your own skills via an online course doesn't quite work. Many times you get told to find your own style but then get forced into singing something which is nothing like your style. As a male singer, much of the material also didn't fit my range. It is also very strange in that the final assignment on which is nearly 40% of you weighted mark comes down to how well you write and others interpret that rather than on any ability to sing or not. If I had paid for this as a separate course I would have asked for my money back.",0,1,Jeff Parker,6620016
15542863~COURSE!~pUTn-GIwEeqdwBL5NQY7lw,1603489377634,3,0,I think it's not that great. The lessons are good but not very clear. The information is quite complete but it is a bit difficult to connect the readings with the lectures. But the one thing I don't like is the fact that the evaluations are optional and the final one it is not mandatory to include the cover and that is so baaad :(. ,0,0,Emilio Ramírez Rodríguez ,15542863
60699261~COURSE!~pUTn-GIwEeqdwBL5NQY7lw,1594463531703,3,0,This course was very helpful in explaining the physical aspects in singing and I appreciate that. I however think that it was a little fast paced and I sort of wish that things were tackled a little more slowly through video lectures.This course still managed to teach me a lot and to inspire me to further improve on my vocals with more studies,0,2,Rya Suarez,60699261

64580355~COURSE!~pUTn-GIwEeqdwBL5NQY7lw,1608735581735,4,0,"It was really great to take this course. I could learn a lot. Maybe some points weren't deeply discussed, but it is a short-lenght course, so I think it was a nice overview. As someone who already had some practice I could learn new things and get a glimpse of techniques I can further develop. I think it might be a little too much for someone who never had any practice at all, the exercises are pretty challanging. I was surprised that the final assessment didn't asked us to send our cover version in the end, it just focuses the process of a cover song, which is also interesting. I reccomend this course, but maybe not for someone who never sang at all.",0,1,Luísa Campelo de Freitas,64580355

It was just some information on singing which was not as organized and progressive as I thought it would be. The assignments could be more related to the material discussed. Just because I had the motivation to complete them, they were very helpful, but most, as I see did not have this motivation so the assignment discussion became quite dull. Lastly, I gave much effort and energy to complete my cover song, but then the actual assignment was not about the cover song itself, but about my reflections on the process. I didn't clearly understand that (perhaps my mistake). ",0,0,Olga Lefa,43245383

First, sometimes people don't get a review, so they get a stuck in the course and can't end it. Second, talking about my experience of getting a review in this course with the final project: My first review was an awful experience because the person who was supposed to review me scored everything in the process with 2 points and the only feedback I received was ""the link was broken so I couldn't listen to your cover"" but I checked the link, and it was working perfectly and on top of that, there was 1 view from them, I know it because it was in a private link and it was the only view in the date that they reviewed me. This person didn't say anything for the actual process, which I wrote carefully, so it was really unfair, so I had to send my project to get a review again. Fortunately the second review I got was good, and really took into account the process of making the cover.",0,0,Diana,81687216
