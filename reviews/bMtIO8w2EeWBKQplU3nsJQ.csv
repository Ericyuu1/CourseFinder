I think it better to not frustrate students with ""passing"" grades. The goal of learning is to learn not to answer questions with only ""one"" correct answer. 0.01 vs .01 is the same but one would be scored correct and the other wrong. Immediate feedback would be a better way to score quizzes.",0,0,Gerald L Pierson,97865919

Also the advanced question sets are bullshit- just cut to the chase already and go for the answers than giving points for ""did you understand the question?"".

97268974~COURSE!~bMtIO8w2EeWBKQplU3nsJQ,1639265215643,2,0,"Although ""Introduction to Chemistry: Reactions and Ratios"" appears to be offered by Duke University, this is not a college level course.  It is far easier than even a first year ""Chemistry I"" course.  For context, I graduated magna cum laude with a bachelors degree in physics, astronomy, and math so I know how rigorous true college level science classes are.  This course is far too easy to be helpful; I finished it in a few days rather than 7 weeks.  And there was no need to actually listen to the lectures; I just quickly read the transcripts (which have some text-to-speech errors), skipping all of the things that were redundant or obvious due to my physics degree and high school chemistry (which wasn't AP but was still more advanced than this course).  First, the instructor of the course considers algebra ""too advanced"" so all of the quiz/homework problems which require algebra are in the ""honors"" track.  (Because of this, I recommend this class to my junior high Algebra I students who want a head start on high school).  But, as part II of this course, Structures and Solutions, acknowledges, to really talk about electrons, you need the wavefuncion from quantum mechanics, and that requires calculus. Furthermore, the homework/quiz problems for this course are not pedagogically useful.  Until week 6, the problems were all duplicates of problems we had already seen solved many times in class; that doesn't help students to apply their knowledge in new situations.  By contrast, week 6 tested concepts which had not been introduced in the course.  In addition, the only feedback provided by the quiz is ""correct"" or ""incorrect"" for each problem.  Without showing the correct answer or explaining why a given answer is wrong, students can't learn effectively from practice.  (Also, the quiz has the wrong answer marked correct for 2-3 problems).  I found the ""honors"" material patronizing.  As a teacher, I understand the value of scaffolding to help students learn difficult material.  But this material was not difficult, and there was too much scaffolding even for middle school learners.  Each assignment consisted of about 5 actual problems subdivided into 20 or so questions.  Each problem would first ask ""do you understand the terms in this problem.""  Then it asked you to list all the formulas and/or facts from the periodic table necessary to solve the problem.  Then it asked you to state in your own words how you would solve the problem.  (Sometimes, the best answer was ""do exactly the same thing I did on the previous problem."")  Finally, it asked for the answer.  Since the quiz was automatically graded, I think it gave you credit for anything you wrote in the 'short answer' type questions.  If it had asked you to show your work, and that work had been taken into consideration when grading, then it might have been worthwhile.  But since I had already solved the problem on paper, there was no pedagogical value in typing the equations and values I had used into my phone.    In summary, if you are looking for a college level introduction to chemistry, look elsewhere.  This material is less advanced than high school chemistry.  It's not worth paying for a certificate as the quality of this material is not commensurate with a college course.  If you want to do some quick and easy review of your high school chemistry over a weekend, of if you are a middle school student who wants to study chemistry, this course might be right for you.",0,1,Alicia m,97268974

There are many great theoretical exercises and real-life examples to their discussions. I also like how they simplified the mole concept into an easily digestible one. However, at times, the course gives examples that students that are not yet acquainted with chemistry may have a hard time processing. It also discusses some concepts that are tied to some chemistry concepts that the course decided not to dabble with, e.g., using examples to show Lewis electron-dot notation and electron pairs but not thoroughly discussing how that works. Because of this, I would not recommend this to students that don't have any idea about chemistry, or to those that hadn't learned it in their secondary schools.",0,0,Carlo Tac-an,75178775
