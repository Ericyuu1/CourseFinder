Probably the professor's students were told to rate this lecture series which is where those 4 and 5 stars are coming from. She's just basically reading off powerpoint slides. The quizzes asked in between videos are totally irrelevant to what had rather had not been spoken or discussed before. She just throws around T, a, b, ne, no; all sorts of jargon without any sort of prior explanation of what sort of Greek she's talking.I learnt a lot more about displays from the Texas instruments 5-10 minute videos than this entire course series. Had I not gone over the Texas instruments videos before, all of this would have felt like ancient Egyptian to me.",0,7,Yogiraj Ranade,46511423
