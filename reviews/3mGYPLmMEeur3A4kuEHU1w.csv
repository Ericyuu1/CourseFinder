78357527~COURSE!~3mGYPLmMEeur3A4kuEHU1w,1656679506929,4,0,"Curso e muito bom para quem esta iniciando o estudo da linguagem C. Os exercicios sao bons para fixar a materia. Unico ponto negativo e que apos concluir o segundo curso esta comecando a ficar um pouco cansativo o modelo, pois nao vemos os professores no video, apenas ouvimos o som e vemos o codecast. Acredito que variar um pouco a metologia seria importante para deixar o curso mais atrativo. ",0,1,Paula Lucena,78357527
123603704~COURSE!~3mGYPLmMEeur3A4kuEHU1w,1675802741570,5,0,"i already wrote the feedback but i really want to mention that this codecast environment is so usable and friendly and the exercise is so enjoyable. I want to continue this series right away because i really get preoccupied with this environment and usability. This course tends to be minimal and quite oriented for the fast intro for c language. Though there are some details left behind, it seems so best choice for starting practical programming  i think.",0,0,임현진,123603704
