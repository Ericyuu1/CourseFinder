Not only do these videos look dated (when were these videos made? 10 years ago), but the IDE they make you use looks like it was made in the 90s. The instructors DO NOT explain anything in detail, leaving me feeling even more confused than when the video started. Most videos are 5 minutes long and the instructor rushes through the topic almost like they don't want to be doing it.  
As for the readings, NO ONE learns coding through reading. But even if they did, the lectures you force the students to read are almost in a different language. If I need a dictionary and other YouTube videos to explain what I'm reading, then you've failed in your goal of teaching.
When you expect me to pay $50 a month for a course, I expect better quality and production than what I can find for free on YouTube. 
To anyone reading this.... SAVE YOUR MONEY and find free stuff on YouTube, or pay $12-15 on Udemy and get better lectures from there.
To anyone who made these video...DO BETTER! This low quality crap is why people get demoralized when they want to learn code and give up.",0,0,Awase Ahmad,98827835

106759622~COURSE!~__y3wBnnEeW9dA4X94-nLQ,1663820674710,1,0,"I​ really want to know if the people giving this course glowing reviews are real people that have taken other programming courses on Coursera.  I've done a bunch, and this may be the worst one that I've seen.  It's definitely not accessible to beginners.  If you can't already program well in another language, this will be unintelligible to you.  T​he lectures are super easy to follow because they are written like they were designed for audiences of small children.  As soon as you go and try to do the assignments, you'll notice that they are very difficult and that watching the videos (even multiple times) does nothing to prepare you for what you are doing.  Even the first exercise is brutally hard if you don't already know what you are doing with respect to object oriented programmings patterns.   They give you a big file with some prewritten functions and then expect you to be able to write several functions to solve increasingly more complex problems based on the methods from their custom class.  There's a very good chance that you'll look at it and just stare blankly because nothing prepares you for what you are expected to do.  T​he big issue that I can't get over is that although I can sort of stumble my way through things, I don't feel like the course explains how and why things work the way that they do.  Why am I doing [insert whatever task]? I have no idea really.  W​hen you realize that you have no idea what is going on, you'll go into the forum and notice that every question you have has been asked by multiple people already, often going back several years.  It's obvious that nobody maintains or looks at these discussion forums.  E​veryone else has pointed it out, but it's worth saying again:  BlueJ is terrible.  Why one earth would you force people to use an IDE that nobody else uses?  Being forced to use BlueJ alone is a reason to not finish this course.  Just don't do it--it's awful.  I​ also think it's terrible to write custom classes for a course and then make the course completely dependent on them.  Why do courses do this?  It literally makes most of what we are doing useless outside of the class. ",0,0,Richard Creek,106759622

Also, the duration of the courses was WAY off, I work a full time job, so I was excited about taking this class in my free time after work and for an hour or two on the weekends. However, I found that I had to set aside at least 3-4 hours EACH DAY to accomplish the tasks and try to squeeze information out of instructional videos that just wasn't there. The instructors overcomplicate topics, while speaking in a tone as if they are talking to children. Some of the information that was mentioned I could not find anywhere else online, so I was stuck trying to take notes from the readings and videos, only to get to the quiz and NOTHING lines up with what was taught. They attempt to teach you from the ground up, however, they jump around from topic to topic to where it's impossible to feel like you're actually building on what you have previously learned.

I've done other courses on Coursera and have learned so much, but in this specialization, I find myself dreading every single week of ""learning"" and assignments. Its not Java itself that's making it bad, its the way Duke teaches:First, the course says that no previous Java knowledge is necessary, though from Week 1, that is clearly not the case. They literally didn't teach me the proper syntax to get started. I have to buy ""Mastering Java"" from Amazon to get base level knowledge. Second, about 25% of Duke's weekly assignments is stuff they haven't gone over. Its fine to struggle, that's a part of learning, but the jump from what's been covered in the lesson to what the final task of the weekly assignment goes over is frustrating to say the least. Programming languages give no mercy for syntax errors, so when you haven't learned the syntax for something you've assigned, its gets painful very quickly and there's no way out because the original assignment/request was so random to begin with that you're not sure what the final output should be, therefore you can't figure it out on your own. Lastly, their estimated time it takes to complete an assignment is WAY off. I've done plenty of courses on Coursera and they usually overestimate how long assignments take. Duke drastically underestimates it. Every week's assignment supposedly takes 10 minutes. I know what I'm doing and every assignment takes at least 1-1.5 hrs because of all the random stuff they want me to do.I hoped Duke's nonsense stopped after the Javascript course (yes, they assigned Javascript in their Java specialization.

I have experience with JavaScript and Python and made several courses in Coursera, and i can say for sure that the learning curve on this course i really high: first you are learning about variables and next you have to handle data from an external source and execute it calling a Java function with the BlueJ environment (first week). A beginner course should give you confidence to handle well the programmming language and from time to time let you try things with the language, not simply trow you to a complex problem and see if you can handle it (because this is learning course, it is suppose to be a guide for your future problems).

4246900~COURSE!~__y3wBnnEeW9dA4X94-nLQ,1610273337615,3,0,"I took this course as a part of Java Programming Specialization. My prior experience in programming consisted of several lessons on Pascal back in school about 13 years ago, so basically zero experience + 1st course on HTML+CSS+JS.  This course wasn't as great as the first one. First problem is BlueJ. That's the environment you're forced to use for coding. Forced - because Duke created some Java libraries for learning purposes and added them to their BlueJ version. The problem is that nobody uses BlueJ in real life. There is an option - you can download those libraries and add them to another environment of your choosing (and used in real world), to learn more efficiently. But don't expect any help with that.Also the reason of great frustration for me was estimated time info. It's a total mess. It says for example about 30 min for a programming assignment, about 4 hours to complete the whole week. Not going to happen, probably even if you are a pro. I'm not a pro and 30min turned out to be 3-10 hours and 4 hours turned to be 3-4 days (about 8 hours per day, because I had free time), depending. The first week was the worst, because I had completely no idea what i'm supposed to be doing. Mentors advised to rewatch the videos. It got slightly better in the 2nd week, but I'd still say it was extremely challenging and frustrating. Another thing is assignment specification: if you want to pass the graded quiz, you have to read all threads in the forums on each method you're required to write. For some reason, half of the info will be there in the discussion forums, dated 2 years ago, and not in the problem statement. You won't pass the quizzes without a working program.Concluding, I'll say that you'll definitely get some Java knowledge and experience from this course, but get ready to spend three more times than stated, and to work on your own, beginner level or not. Unless you know a developer you might ask for help if you get stuck.If you have an option of rushing through this course instead of the first one in your 7 day free trial, I strongly recommend to do so. This might help you to make a better informed decision before paying for the subscription.",0,6,Ekaterina Voronova,4246900

That's because everything is given to you without further details (because it works anyhow if you put all the files in your workspace folder) like IDE and some resource files etc. Literally, you have no chance to learn the things I've mentioned here. So I had to take a full course of Java from YouTube. And then it got way more easier for me and from that moment, everything was just a piece of cake. I completely agree with those of you guys who insist that it's definitely not a beginner's course, it's at least intermediate course. However, if you decide to take this course, don't give up by some tough parts you're facing because it might be much worse in a real class I suppose. Try to give yourself some time to discover more about Java outside of this course. Java is a great language after all, and I kinda understand now why many people love TypeScript. Type safety features are really nice.  :)  Overall, it was a decent course to follow along and learn Java. It was pretty tough from the beginning, even though I had some experiece with JS and Python.

Unfortunately, in my opinion this course is not intended for real beginners. From class one I struggled trying to understand what was going on. This may be because instead of just using a  typical ide like eclipse or netbeans, they use bluejay, which works different than the rest of ides. In addition, programs used in the course are pretty confusing (If you know 0 Java).

I also think, as I've stated before, that the assignments should be divided into separate parts as separate assignments. Have parts 1-6 in one assignment feels very daunting and demotivational; not to mention, all the time estimates are much, much too low. I finished the mini project at over 200 lines of code. The amount of time estimated for the project was grossly underestimated for beginners and still quite off for professionals.

The teachers are good, but the content needs a couple of changes. The first week is a basic introduction to Object Oriented Programming: functions, methods,objects,classes. As this is just a beginners course, this is not used much for the rest of the course, only methods are really used. I think that it's unnecessary and confusing to go over these complex topics so quickly in the beginning of a course like this.Additionally, the assignments and explanations in Week 3 and 4 are not perfectly aligned. Specifically, the videos only explain accessing folders using the DirectoryResource () or FileResource() methods, in which a prompt will appear for the user to select the file. A file name can also be specified in these methods to open a file that has already been imported to the BlueJ Project. None of the videos show how to import one or multiple files to the BlueJ Project, even tough this is required in the assignments.

Some quiz questions were valuable where as some were just to verify if the code was right and I thought it was a bit of a waste of time to do those by hand if I'm honest.

The quizzes (each one of them) require you to answer questions based on implementing the programs described in the exercise - it's a good way to get you to actually write down and code each tiny thing without ever thinking ""aah this part is too easy. I can do it quickly so I won't be coding it now."" This is still very much of an introductory course and does not delve much into object-oriented concepts of programming. Most concepts of Java would be discussed in further courses (I believe). So as mentioned earlier, this course mostly deals with basic programming constructs. It helps you build big programs by adding a layer of complexity each time you revisit. It's more of a programming course than a Java course. Java is just a tool used here (which is the right way to learn programming - learn the methodologies/programming paradigms rather than the language syntax). The one star it loses is because personally I was expecting a bit more object-oriented focus here rather than an intro to programming based approach. If you are new to the world of programming - by all means, do take it, you'll enjoy this one. If you're a slightly experienced person - you might consider more in-depth/challenging courses instead.Pro-tip: Solve each exercise and code every part sincerely and you'll make the most out of it.",0,0,Pranav Bhosale,54231634

21193833~COURSE!~__y3wBnnEeW9dA4X94-nLQ,1482237818288,4,0,"All in all, this was a tough course, and the programming increased progressively as one moved on. Week 1 was OK, but I experienced a temporary hiccup in week 2 in the reading of the codon files; until I converted them to Strings. Even then the first file which contained only one DNA string gave its fair share of problems. In general, the section on Strings was pretty comprehensive. The programming was also pretty challenging. The section on debugging was OK, but I am at this stage still a little confused as to the amount and detail of information one is supposed to supply to someone else when you are experiencing a problem with your code. With the week 2 quiz I made a mistake than came back to haunt me in week 4; I did not read the question properly and from the outset my cgRatio method was not producing the correct answer. Eventually, after reading the specs for cgRatio again, I realised my mistake, could correct my code and get through the week 2 quiz!  Week 3 on parsing, reading CSV files etc, the going was pretty good and I managed to complete the work covered in this section without too many problems. Week 4 on baby names; well, yes the mini Project was pretty extensive, with a lot of Methods being asked for and written. I found the small test files to be invaluable during testing. But the quiz contained a few curved balls. Method totalBirths does just that, and although in the specification it does say that it should also print the number of girls and boys names, and the total names in the file. Q1 and 2 tripped me up, I did not read them properly, and entered the total number of births for the girls and boys respectively. Questions 9 to 12 also resulted me in having to call a temporary halt, and write an additional method that looped over all the files from 1880 to 2014 in order to get the answers to those questions. Fortunately, method getRank came to the rescue here, doing all of the hard work!This was a lot of work! I did ""week 4"" in one week, but only because I was already on leave and could focus on the mini project for the entire week. The entire course took me 6-7 weeks to complete.I learned a lot. It was a good course, and very challenging. My greatest concern with the format you are using (80% or you don't move on - or you don't qualify), is that one can become ""unstuck"" as I did in week 2, but managed to get past that one.",0,0,Stefan van der Spuy,21193833

I would have certainly have been lost without it.That said, this is a densely-packed course with a wealth of information, and the timeframe is a bit aggressive.  However, it is definitely worth it, as you will come out with a strong base in Java methods and a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming.The course uses a custom version of the BlueJ programming environment, along with a couple of custom libraries provided by Duke.  Again, some people were critical of this decision, but I feel it was well-considered.  The goal here is to teach fundamental concepts and programming, and by simplifying a few elements, the instructors were better able to focus on that,The only criticism I would offer is that I wish they were using an online IDE instead, since that would be more ""portable"" and I could work on it anywhere, rather than being parked at my desk, but that is a minor quibble.I highly recommend this course.

This class first introduces some problem, then gives the tools to solve them and you don't have to remember every syntax. With practice, it just sticks in the brain. This course is even better for those who are transitioning from similar language like C++ or C#. I myself used C++ for last few years. But this transition was so smooth. Really loved it.

I had been out of programming for many years, and decided to try this 
Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software course by Duke 
University on Coursera.org. I really liked the course! It is a great 
review for me of Java programming basics, without the technical jargon 
that goes along with object oriented programming. The really nice part 
is that I can see object oriented principles in action! I enjoyed the 
way Duke University uses the 7 step process for solving problems consistently through the course. They break problems down into small, manageable pieces, that build up to solving a larger problem. Some concepts include: Basic Java syntax, definitions of class, instance variables and methods (functions); variables, For each loops, While loops, Strings, Java types and Java mathematical operators. The assignments were interesting, and include calculating the perimeter of a shape, finding genes in a strand of DNA, working with CSV formatted files to analyze weather data and to find exports from different countries, and finishing with a MiniProject to find interesting trends in American Baby Names from a CSV formatted data files. The Honors assignment was also fun: processing multiple images to convert them to gray scale, or invert the images, and save them with a new filename. Another really nice aspect of this course is that you use a Duke University (on Coursera) version of BlueJ, an interactive design environment for creating Java programs - where everything is a class! The instructors at Duke have created their own java library, with classes to help new learners easily open and close files in the BlueJ environment, and work with Pixels in an image. Duke also has good documentation for each class, which to me, is better than the documentation on the java oracle website. While the Java documentation on the oracle website is still very difficult to read, I have gotten used to looking some documented class, like Strings, and clicking on the ""methods"" tab to look at what you can do with them. However, you really do not need to refer to the Java Oracle documentation to complete the assignments - all you need is the documentation from Duke University! I really liked this class!",0,0,Nancy Wilkens,14436301

Of course using BlueJ and EduDuke libraries (that is libraries crafted specifically for the course that are nor used in real life) gives this feeling of not coding for real. But that's good. Real coding comes in the later courses of this specialization so this approach seems to be very good for introducing people to Java without wasting to much time to details being unimportant on the early stages of learning.,0,0,Szymon Talaga,2936836
