It was a nice overview of what  social norms, and social change are without being overwhelming.

It provided great examples and further readings to anyone interested more in the topic.",0,0,RICARDO DANIEL CARDENAS MARTINEZ,27395982

It deals in detail with how norms can change or fail to change, examining intragroup dynamics as well as attributes of trendsetters or change agents that make them more likely to initiatite norm change, and to succeed in ther attempt.  There is a fascinating ""how to"" list of ways to initiate social change successfully in Lecture 3, which I look forward to revistiing in more detail.  This series of lectures briefly also deals with the persistence of deviant communities, and resistance to norms.  I recommend the course strongly.",0,1,Winnifred R Louis,25315215
