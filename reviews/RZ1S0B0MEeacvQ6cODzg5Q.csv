55062114~COURSE!~RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,1591978103555,1,0,"This course was a travesty. 1. The version of Pandas being taught is not the current version.... so good luck applying this anywhere OR searching for help. 2. The lecture material was wiffle bat level then the assignments were mack truck level 3. I am a professional developer, I know how to use stack overflow and pandas documentation to solve problems. I was looking for a fundamental grounding of the materials. 4. I do feel I came away with a basic understanding of using pandas and python, but that's because I spent about 100 hours looking up answers to every question on here. 5. The lecture is so superficial that you'd learn a python way to do something, then a pandas way to do the same thing, then another pandas way to do something, then that would be the starting block for the assignment that would use advanced concepts. As a result I know 9 ways to do something simple with no recommended best pattern or understanding of when to use one or the other--and they all kind of muddle together now, but then spent dozens of hours researching the actual answers to the questions. ""This is the way I like to do xyz, because of this. There are 3 other ways you may see and I'll briefly show you them"" would be great. 6. For how important it is, the distinction between methods that mutate data and methods that don't was pretty minimal. 7. The online exercise thing is worthless. It uses an old version of pandas AND there are certain code breaking idiosyncracies in the tool AND it considers a pandas INT wrong if it's looking for an INT but there's no requirement in the question and no discussion of how to transform these or if there's any reason to do so other than to make the autograder happy. Look in the forum, there's straight answers like ""an upgrade broke this, so it is not expected to work"" which is a bad experience if you spend a few hours trying to debug code before looking up the answer. IT shakes your faith in all the exercieses. 8. This may be a coursera thing, but I'm learning this for WORK, I need to be able to get stuff working on my local PC. I see the autograder makes things easier, but it's basically a similar but different API. I literally spent 1 hour converting my code so the online grader would run for every 2.5 hours of local coding I did. It's debilitating. 9. This is probably a coursera problem, but it's really difficult to find the question you asked in the forum. Since you can't get through most of this course without forum assistance, that hurts. 10. I feel like I got gas lighted. You cannot do this class without already knowing python. This is mentioned in one of the lectures after you've already signed up. He recommends the Python for Everybody course, but it is very unclear from the Course Description before you pay money. Here are quotes from it, tell me if you would expect this to teach you python: *""This course will introduce the learner to the basics of the python programming environment"", *""including fundamental python programming techniques such as lambdas"", *""SKILLS YOU WILL GAIN: Python Programming"". Then the forum is peppered with answers that say ""This is not a python programming class"". So... SUMMARY: This was my first coursera experience, I was very much looking forward to it and it really shook my confidence in the site. I did learn how to work pandas, but would have done just as well with a list of problems and a google. The ""16 hours to complete"" took me over 2 weeks of full time work--roughly 100 hours--due to both this disconnect between the lecture and the assignments and to the difficulties transforming working local code in a modern version to a buggy online grading system working on an old version of python but with some patches that also render legacy forums only 80% useful as well. The lectures manage to be both superficial and confusing (because they take a superficial topic then jam 4 ways to do the same thing into 30 minutes). And despite the course description you do not learn an intro to python here, just to data science. I will be trying one more coursera course, basically because all the other reviews on here say this is an abnormally poorly run one, but if they're all like this I will return to pluralsight soon.",0,0,Nathaniel Rink,55062114

This is for a number of reasons.The lectures are not really lectures, they are more of a narration of someone else writing code on screen, the intructor just whizzes through what's happening without giving any proper explanation (I cannot stress this enough). The limited explanation provided is just on what's happening on the screen rather than why we're doing it this way compared to any other way. There is also not enough guidance given in the lectures but told to just figure it out and go post on Stack Overflow. Anyone familiar with Stack Overflow should know, they *really* do not like beginners posting repetitive questions - so I find that advice from the instructor really odd.The courses makes use of Numpy, but gives zero explanation on what Numpy is and why we use it. It just dives into it by using Numpy arrays and expects you to either magically understand it or go learn what/why Numpy, from someone else.Speaking about assignments, a lot of the excercises require you to do something which hasn't been covered in the sessions at all. I understand giving a challene in assignments, but I would much rather prefer those challenges be related to things taught or from resources given / pointed to. But, unfortunately, you have to figure a lot out on your own and the videos are of no help.It also doesn't help that the assignment feedback is very lacking. The grader also does not tell you what answer it expects, so you have no way of knowing how far off your answer is.This is further not helped by the out-dated version of Pandas running (0.19.2). It has a 4 year old version. I tried to do the assignments locally, but then coming onto Coursera to find the methods I've used aren't supported. This causes further frustation with the ""go learn on your own"" approach, as every resource you'll find will be using methods/functions from the latest versions. You then have to spend hours more finding legacy methods for what you're trying to do (which, in practice, will be useless as you will always be working on updated packages)In my opinion, this course is not worth the money.

The video lectures are super condensed and lot of information comes your way and actually trying that out on Jupyter notebook on the side easily takes 5-6 times. When you get down to the assignments, you will realize that videos only scratched the surface of the topic and in some cases some of the concepts to be used were not at all discussed in the videos.You have to learn by yourself, and your best friends are StackOverflow, Google, Python and Pandas documentation. Once you have researched and spent hours putting together the solution to assignments, you will spend more hours struggling with the autograder (At this moment, I am stuck for over two weeks with the autograder at Week3 of the course).

FIRSTLY They do not TEACH any of the material.  Instead they simply list - very briefly - a ton of functions/ methods/ objects etc without providing any real details of how they operate.  Teaching the basics and then expecting the students to do further study and practice using those basics would be fine.  Spending 30 seconds or less on a function / method/ objects is NOT teaching the basics.   READING A TEXTBOOK on the topics covered was more effective then doing the course material!!!  What kind of modern on-line course is less effective at teaching a topic than a textbook?SECONDLY The autograder for the programming assignments is a joke.  I took the course to learn how to code successfully.  The autograder does not test that - it could not even get question 1 of assignment 3 correct.  Instead, the students are expected to read through the forums and then spend hours making ridiculously stupid adjustments to corrects for errors present in the autograder.  Seriously?

In addition, the course does not give sufficient insight in videos to help you with questions.  You have to search stack overflow and other sources to work out answers.

I won't take another class in this sequence. I have taken ~10 online classes this year and only gave up on 2, including this one.I wasted too much time in weeks 3 and 4 cleaning data. When result dataframes have hundreds of rows it isn't trivial to scroll through them looking for problems. Time wasted on this would have been better spent on pandas. I get that data cleaning is a big part of data science, but this is a class not a job.A few questions tended to be vague on requirements but then very particular on what data is acceptable. The worst is getting a question wrong because the answer has type int64 and the grader wanted int. It doesn't help when the grader just says 'wrong answer' and there are no visible tests. The first question on assignment 4 is a good example of that. I did finish convert_housing_data_to_quarters, but from reading discussion forums that too has a few unstated requirements.There were also a few typos in assignments 3 and 4.

I would not waste time and money on this course when there are much better options out there. I feel like I've gotten little in return for my time and money.First, there is no accompanying book (only slides).  A self-contained accompanying book is a valuable resource, helping students prepare for lecture, and serving as a reference manual later on (I still regularly use my Coursera book on introductory Python).  That there is no pdf reference for this class is indefensible (both of the other coursera courses I’ve had access to have had excellent self-contained books that followed the lecture). Instead, the student is directed to several other books they can purchase elsewhere.Second, as several other students have noted, the timeframe for assignments is really unrealistic, taking much longer than projected (at least for me, and several other students).  This is not acceptable when Coursera bills by the month. Coursera needs to provide a better assessment of the time commitments for the class.  Moreover, several of the in-video quizzes are disconnected from the material, often requiring extra research.  Consulting other resources is fine (it’s part of coding), but the point of the quizzes should be to give the student practice implementing a concept that was just introduced.Third, the teaching is horrific. The professor is not engaging at all, but simply mechanically reads lines which often sound straight out of a user manual.  The point of online videos is not to turn books into audio files- it’s to have a human talk/reason through problems with you. The teacher of the course should discuss the material, not recite a manual.  A great example of well-done online teaching is Dr. Chuck Severance, whose videos the teachers of this course would do well to consult.  In addition, the material is presented far too quickly.  Fourth, the title of this course is a misnomer: an introduction to data science would provide an overview of the tools, techniques and scope of the field.  An extremely detailed introduction to Pandas, which is essentially what most of this course is, is useful if well executed (which it is not here), but it is not an introduction to data science. A more minor complaint is the absolutely horrendous choice of the background.  Showing different permutations of lifeless office drones is not exactly inspiring material for aspiring data scientists, even if this the reality of office life- it’s distracting at best, and at worst, deeply disparaging. Why not have just a plain colored background? Or anything else?The experience of this class is making me question whether I will ever pay for a Coursera course again.  The amount of time I’ve wasted on pointless exercises is not warranted by what I’ve learned from this class- in retrospect I would have learned more just by purchasing one of the books referred to in the class introduction.

There's 30-40 mins of lecture each week that's basically lightly narrated typing into a Jupyter notebook with only the slightest bit of additional explanation about what the instructor is doing, although the material covered is substantial. There's lot of important details that are glossed over -- forcing the student to pause the lecture and do offline research to understand what just happened.Similarly, the assignments address and cover beyond the material covered, but the instruction is scarcely sufficient to understand the concepts required to complete them, so lots of Stack Overview and other research is required. And the automated grader, as expected, is completely literal so for complex problems, not much help in validating whether you're on the right track. Assignments take many multiples of the estimated time.And because even for paying students (such as myself), you never get access to an answer key even after the assignment is due, you have no idea how closely your solution conformed to best practices, even if you arrived at the right answer. For coding, this makes all of the difference, particularly with large datasets that could consume considerable computing resources if not done correctly.

Why the poor review: I'm sure that the intention of the teacher (Prof. Brooks) is for the student to be challenged and obtain familiarity with several ""advanced"" functionalities of Python. When I had finished the last assignment I felt that way, but not due to the lectures (only ~2.5 hours all in all). The pace of these lectures is too fast (probably because they are scripted). The teacher should slow down a bit and show some more examples (for inspiration watch Prof. Andrew Ng from Stanford lecture on machine learning). I'm not suggesting to show explicit solutions of the assignments, but just a few more examples such that the transition from lecture to problem solving is less ""frustrating"".

I gave it 2 stars for two reasons.1) The videos are deceptively short. In MOOC instructional design, you normally design short videos because the attention span of an online learner is tends to be much shorter than an in-person university student. However, in this course, even though the video is short, it is really 5-10 times longer because they speed over the equations and teaching so fast that you have to pause and replay and rewind and replay several times while trying it yourself. So the timings are not truly accurate. If you were actually teaching it in a classroom with actual students you would go much more slowly. In this case, I wish they were more honest with the times by actually typing the code in real time while teaching. I would have preferred a lecture to make it more digestible.2) The hardest thing for me about the course was the fact that instead of practicing computational thinking within data science (decomposition, algorithmic thinking, etc.), I was really just searching on stack overflow for how to put it into python. It's poor instructional design to only teach somethings and expect students to complete assignments without giving them all the tools they will use in the assignment. It would be ok if it were an accidental mistake, but this seems to be purposeful. This happened not just in course assignments but sometimes even in mid-roll video-overlaid quizzes where the answer was something not explained or taught or shown. This was really strange to me and caused a huge amount of time to be spent searching online or trying mid-lecture problems to no avail. It cause all the timings of the course to be off (#1 caused the video timings to be severely off and #2 meant that the course assignment estimates were HUGELY miscalculated). Good instructional design would mean that the professor should show all the tools one could use to faithfully complete and achieve the assignment. For some reason that was avoided again and again in this course.Great material though. I loved learning.

I was stuck in a particular problem because auto grader did not give me a clear feedback as to why I was incorrect. I wasted too much time on this already.The assignments require too much research outside what is covered in the videos. I don't feel that is right. The assignment requires that we research on Stack Overflow and Pandas documentation. I strongly feel that such activities should be performed only outside the course work when we try to solve real world problems. Course assignments should be reasonably given based only the materials covered in video. This was taking too much time.TThe discussion forums are not giving clear hints.

I have spent my last 8 years on data analytics/statistical analysis on other platforms, mainly Stata. Most of the techniques presented to me in this course are, therefore, familiar to me in other languages.To start with, the course should suggest/direct you to a better tool for you to solve the assginments than Jupyter notebooks. Using Anaconda/Spyder is of relevant.Pedagogically speaking, lectures are terribly designed. They mostly rely on Jupyter notebooks, which are sloppy and will jump in unsynchronized manner with the presenter. Some of them are too long, skipping the main point or logic of the tool being presented.Assignments are really good. You will learn a lot from them and you will need to go for the documentation and StackOverflow to get answers. This is actually very important, as real life data management work do need this ability: your productivity will increase by how proficient you are looking for different solutions. But still, the assignements' autograder has too many mistakes and fails giving you reliable/effective feedback.

So why have it?2. Assignments. Ooof. Lets break this down. a. Autograder is poor. Aside from the oddities that just break it sometimes, the hidden test feedback is lacking. If my answer is off at the 15th decimal point because my dataframe is 226 rows and not 227. I need another assert and feedback telling me that. Instead of a lesson on logic a lot of these problems became frustrating cases of github searching for other peoples passing code and then working backwardsb. Assignments felt rushed. Each assignment had poorly written questions that frequently popped up in the forums asking for clarification. The assignments themselves had odd jumps in difficulty and assumptions. Some would build upon the lectures but other times they would jump and assume that we would figure out the middle. Oftentimes we did, but imperfectly, and the assignments penalized us for that imperfection. For example, if question says clean the data and we do using one of a dozen different ways why are we penalize if we have 224 clean rows, and the answer requires 227. If that level of end accuracy is required, then we need more guidance to achieve exactly that. 3. Forums. Useless. Filled with garbage, and the useful ones are unstructured mess. For one, the autograders output is small grey typwriter text which is undecipherable and the TAs always wanted it posted. This lead to long chains of code blocks and one line responses.

The requirements of the questions are not communicated in a consistently clear way. What was more irritating, though, was that the auto-grader is extremely picky. There is very little room to solve the problem in your own way, and more of my time was spent trying to contort my code to fit what the auto-grader wanted than spent actually solving the problem and applying the course concepts. I also was disappointed with how much we were expected to manually clean data. One of the questions even explicitly says that the answer will require students to ""hand-code"" the answer. This strikes me as an extremely poor habit to instill in students--combing through data manually to strong-arm the data into the formatting conventions won't cut it when tackling a dataset that is millions of lines long.

This course will discourage nearly anyone from pursuing Data Science.And it's not even an intro to data science.  It's a course on Pandas for dataset manipulation.  (In fairness, cleaning up ingest data is like 95% of the work in data science, but the course doesn't even tease the student with some exciting machine learning examples of where this is all headed.)It's not delivered like you'd expect an intro course.  It does an awful job of progressing the student through the Pandas toolset, building concepts incrementally.  The whole topic of object types, methods, returned objects, and chaining gets barely a mention, but it's essential to the assignments.  Examples are rapid-fire and sparse - very few techniques needed in the assignments can be found in the examples.  The Week 2 quiz tests on techniques not introduced until Week 3, and the Week 3 and 4 assignments cite ""individual study"" which is academic-speak for ""We didn't teach you about this - go Google it"".Then, there are errata that the student needs to pick out of the discussion forums to pass the assignments because some key questions are vague.  The errata are 1-2 years old and they can't be bothered to correct errors.The auto-grader could be the highlight of the course, but it provides limited feedback on wrong answers and no guidance toward the right answer; just ""wrong"".  You're not allowed to post code or discuss answers in the forum - you have to go to StackOverflow to do that.  (It'd be awesome if several of the exercises provided the student with the answer and challenged them to match it, but instead it's very sink-or-swim.)Even when your answer is right, the auto-grader throws errors and warnings for, say, returning a numpy.float64 (which you should) when the grader is expecting a Python float type.  Or it's expecting a float64 for a counter value (!!) when you provide an int64 (which is correct).  These behaviors should have been fixed long ago.It claimed to be a 15-hour course; I did it intensively and invested more than 30 hours before pulling the plug on the final project.  That was claimed to be a 4-hour project, but experience with the rest of the course says it'd be more like another 12 hours - and that's for a guy who's not new to coding.Bottom-line: I paid for educational material and I don't feel like this course delivers.  What it does deliver is Pandas exercises and an ""OK"" auto-grader; truthfully, most of what I learned was via Google searches while trying to do the assignments - effective, but very slow and very frustrating.  The real disappointment is seeing that the issues I encountered have been well-known for 2 years in the discussion forums; the course could be a lot better by now if they cared to nurture it.Finally, a frustrating aside that's on Coursera, not the instructors... Coursera's online Jupyter notebook platform is really unstable and constantly drops connections even when you're actively editing and executing cells.  (Including from 2 Fortune 100 companies - it's not the connection.)  Once dropped, the notebook can't be re-connected, and has to be re-launched from the syllabus at the risk of losing your most recent edits.  (But beware, if you run Jupyter offline for stability, this course also has defective input filenames that will cause grading to fail - read the discussion forums first.)",0,0,Richard Hornbaker,4893330

Let me preface this by saying that the material you learn is very helpful. Pandas is a great library to learn for loading, cleaning, and manipulating large amounts of data. But the real problem with this course isn't the material, it's the lectures and the autograder. The lectures are very short. They don't cover the concepts well enough, and some material is blatantly skipped and you have to learn it yourself through google. Then comes the video quizzes which test you on functions and concepts that haven't even been introduced yet. It's like the quizzes were put at timestamps randomly. Then comes the worst part of the course: the Autograder. I'm not sure how old this course is but the autograder is running on an outdated version of both python and pandas. What does this mean for you? Well if you want to code on your computer instead of the course's broken online coding notebook, you will run into severe code-breaking bugs between versions. It really ruins the course. I learn the material but then spend hours trying to please the broken autograder.

Firstly, it has something to do with the language that the lecturer uses to explain the concepts in Python. The language he uses is unnecessarily complicated. The sentences are very long and the words he uses are vague . If you want to explain a relatively complex concept, you need to use simpler and more comprehensible words.

37791776~COURSE!~RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,1545075120436,2,0,"There are several inherent problems with this course and how it is structured. I would like to preface this review by stating that I am likely below the level of python mastery required to complete the course; I came in with a simple background of some time spent learning from introductory texts, but I've never worked with the language professionally and I have been out of practice for a couple years. The course is labeled 'intermediate', though how 'intermediate' is unclear since there is only one elementary course recommended to get you ""up to speed"" enough to take the class. I used my free week as a test to see if my background was enough to be able to hang with this; it was not. However, even for someone with more depth of understanding than me, this course is poorly designed to teach. Each lecture is between 2 and 10 minutes long, and they do a very poor job of explaining concepts. The notes provided in the supplied notebooks lack any sort of meaningful documentation, and so it becomes trivial to get lost as the lectures go on at lightning speed and you have no comments or notations at all in-text to explain how one thing they did is different from the next. Furthermore, the difficulty and complexity of concepts spikes up rapidly. Using the in-lecture questions as a barometer, the complexity jump is like going from addition to calculus in the blink of an eye. The first in-lecture question during one of the early videos requests you make a very simple change to a supplied piece of code to add three numbers instead of two. Two in-lecture questions later you're asked to create a list of all possible combinations of a number and letter system for a hypothetical internet company based loosely on concepts you learned 15 minutes ago and never before had a chance to break down or practice in any real detail.After quiz 1 is where I threw in the towel. Looking at the future assignments, as well as the discussion board, things seemed like they would only get worse, not better. Assignments are highly complex and rely on an understanding of python well beyond what this course, and the one before it, will give you. Users with years of programming experience were having to rely on google, text books, and stack exchange to solve the assignments. This course is too light on details and too focused on speed. You'll essentially be teaching yourself what you're supposed to do. As my first attempt going through a MOOC, this was a letdown. Part of this is on me, as I do not have the requisite background to fully engage and succeed here. Part of it is on the structure of the course, which truthfully seems to focus on speed and ease for the creators rather than in depth of understanding for the students. If you're considering this track, I recommend instead picking up some textbooks and going through this yourself. You'll lose the certifiable, but you'll have a less frustrating time.

I was really excited about the this course, and was really let down. This course is really, really poorly done. I would not waste time and money on this course when there are much better options out there. I feel like I've gotten little in return for my time and money.
First, as several other students have noted, the timeframe for assignments is really unrealistic, taking much longer than projected (at least for me, and several other students). This is not acceptable when Coursera bills by the month. Coursera needs to provide a better assessment of the time commitments for the class. I took another datasciense course prior to this one (my employer wants a certificate) but still the assignments were tough, and I found it really dissappointing that I spend a lot of time solving inconsistencies in the assignments. I believe American students are in advantage here because of the Geo-American orientated datasets.
Second, the teaching is horrific. The professor is not engaging at all, but simply mechanically reads lines which often sound straight out of a user manual. The point of online videos is not to turn books into audio files- it’s to have a human talk/reason through problems with you. The teacher of the course should discuss the material, not recite a manual. In addition, the little amount of material is presented far too quickly, Also great emphasis is put on the discussion groups (which turns out to be just responded by the moderators, volunteers). In absence of a proper syllabus students are directed to Stack Overflow, a sign of the courses' weakness.

Third, the title of this course is a misnomer: an introduction to data science would provide an overview of the tools, techniques and scope of the field. An extremely detailed introduction to Pandas, which is essentially what most of this course is, is useful if well executed (which it is not here), but it is not an introduction to data science.
A more minor complaint is the absolutely horrendous choice of the background. Showing different permutations of lifeless office drones is not exactly inspiring material for aspiring data scientists, even if this the reality of office life- it’s distracting at best, and at worst, deeply disparaging. Why not have just a plain colored background? Or anything else?The only positive thing besides some of the misleading assignemnts are the rest of the assignments.

Sometimes it took me more time to actually understand what I was supposed to do than actually doing it, because it wasn't really clear what was required. Ok, English is not my first language but I am quite good. Besides, lots of other students complained about confusing wording, so it's not just me. Sometimes some instructions were missing and you'd only realise that after digging through the discussion forums for hours. So, basically there were a few things that made the whole experience more difficult than it had to be, and they weren't about knowledge or skils but about the course ""infrastructure"". Before I started this course I'd already taken a few courses on Python programming (on a different platform), including numpy and pandas, but the assinments in this course were still qute difficult for me. You have to do a lot of searching online to get to the solution. In general, I'm all for the idea of having to do more self-learning but the online format is already more challenging than face-to-face learning, so I think it would help to have a few guided exercises between the lectures to understand the material better. Maybe if I had more experience with Python and programming, it would be easier.One thing that disappointed me was that they recommended a book (optional reading), but you would have to purchase it. Now, if we were studying on campus then we would have access to the university library where we could borrow this book (probably), but as online students we don't have that option. I understand that they can't just upload copywrited books for anyone to access but maybe they could come up with a system that would allow students to somehow access the books temporarily, or make just a few necessary chapters available. I think that's for Coursera to manage, not for the University of Michigan though, because the university can only take advantage of whatever technology coursera can offer (at least that's my understanding).On a positive note, the discussion forums were quite helpful, and the teaching staff were quick to answer most of the time. I suggest, if you take this course, then take full advantage of the discussion forums. I also liked that there were two types of assignments (multiple choice quiz and programming).

27878220~COURSE!~RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,1586230380658,3,0,"I think all the assignments in this course are interesting and well designed. I learned more from doing the assignments than watching the videos. Yes, it took me a lot of time searching and reading stack overflow and other similar resources, but I did learn from them. Most of my frustration was in fact coming from their outdated Autotrader - for those who plan to do the assignments on local Jupyter Notebook, you'll run into some confusion and frustration with their Autograder as their Pandas are not as updated as your Pandas. This means that even though your code can run perfectly correct on your local, it doesn't mean it would do the same with the Autograde after you uploaded for grading. I spent tons of time, not on debugging exactly, but on figuring out why my code won't just execute after submission. I guess my advice to avoid similar frustration would be just writing assignments in the Jupyter Notebook on Coursera. As for the video lectures, I agree that they could and should be made better in terms of pedagogy. I'm sure the professor and the teaching assistance are absolutely knowledgable on the subject, but their teaching style is way too stiff. Basically they were just reading off a prepared script, which was not colloquial at all, and they rush through it. I don't think coding skills can be taught in the way of lectures as if delivering a TV speech. Honestly, lots of free youtube videos are better at online teaching than this course. This is an intermediate level course in python, but entitling it as 'Introduction to Data Science in Python' kinda devalued how much of strength people have to spend on finishing it.  But all in all, I did learn a lot from completing this course, thanks to the well-designed assignments.

I discovered this after I answered the question, was told it was correct, but I produced wrong answers for subsequent questions that depended on the first one.  Messages from fellow students in the forum helped me track down the problem.Assn. 3, question 2: This was worded very awkwardly and the Venn diagram seemed to contradict the question rather than clarify it.Assn. 4, question 1 (""get_list_of_university_towns""): The function template provided has a long comment block that seemed to be complete instructions for what the function should do.  However, there are two other different versions of the instructions for this assignment in the Coursera course resources section and Google Drive.  If the function template includes instructions in the comments, they should be complete.  Otherwise, don't show them at all and let the student get the instructions from the other document.  Also, the course's ""Resources"" section doesn't seem like the correct place for these instructions.  They should be under the ""Instructions"" tab of the assignment submission page.The instructor, teaching staff, mentors, etc. are almost completely unhelpful or extremely slow to answer questions.  With regards to my forum postings for assn. 3, a staff member replied only recently, about two weeks after I asked the question.  Since then, I've completed that assignment and the one following it!The course videos are difficult to watch.  Whenever Mr. Brooks shows how some code works in Jupyter Notebook, he uses a full-screen view of his browser.  On my laptop with a 15-inch screen, his font is a little too small to read easily.  I need to concentrate so much more on deciphering the screen that I can't easily keep up with what he is saying.  Sometimes I wanted to view the course video on my phone or mobile device.  At those times, it was impossible to read the screen being shown.  I recommend these alternate ways of showing the code:Use slides.  Students usually don't need to see the instructor typing in real-time.  Show a slide with the code and the result.Use a large font.  If showing real-time input and results is important for a specific question, use a large font or zoom in the display as much as possible.There were some small mistakes made in the videos and assignments that make me think all the materials need some proofreading and updates.Overall, I'm glad I took the course.  I wish several things were better, though.  I'm looking forward to the next course of the specialization (data visualization), which is the one I was most interested in taking.  I took this course because I would need it for the final certificate and I wanted to be sure I didn't miss any information that would be helpful in the second course.  I thought maybe the first course wouldn't be interesting to me, since I have many years of Python programming experience.  However, I was pleased to find that the course covered a lot of pandas features and some of the mathematics and statistics techniques that I haven't used in many years, so those contributed to making the course challenging.

The grader threw exceptions around when either my Jupyter Note Book nor the Spyder IDE  I use did. I understand the use of documentation is part of the course experience,  but when you find yourself learning more by your own than using the course content, what do I need it for?
When I enrole in a course I hope to hack my way to knowledge, and not just to be tested and loose huge amounts of time looking for the right answer to a specific problem. I want it to teach me how to solve those problems, not to tell me where I can look for possible solutions. Exercises should be a playground for assimilation of concepts and an affordable challenge.

The net result IS worthwhile and you definitely learn by being thrown in the deep end (this is not a softball ""what's a for loop / Programming 101"" type course.)First of all, be aware that the ""estimated time of completion"" for the assignments is low to put it very mildly: assignments that are estimated ""90 minutes"" may be more like eight to ten hours to complete (verified by many different course-takers, all of whom had extensive previous programming experience.)  Do not take this course unless you can spend at least ten hours a week completing the assignments (unless you're already a prodigy in Python/Pandas -- but if so, why take this course?)  Second of all, the lectures do not contain anywhere near all of the material you need to actually complete the assignments (the course creators even acknowledge this.)  It took me a couple of assignments to realize this was so.  It really made me think watching the lectures was a slight waste of time, so if you find yourself frustrated thinking you ""missed something"" because you don't know how to complete the assignment after viewing the lectures, you most likely _didn't_ miss anything: just expect to spend a lot of time Googling answers in order to find what you need.Third: the autograder here is really quirky.  Once I got the hang of it and just reviewed the whole .py file generated to see where the problem was (versus just using the IPython window) it clicked pretty well, but I definitely spent a few hours flailing around trying to get my code to submit successfully.  I hadn't had any issues with any other courses in this department.That being said: the skills learned are definitely ""deep"" and quantifiable and you get right into the thick of things after the first assignment.

Also, the subject of the assignments are mostly interesting and realistic problems. As is, though, I'm not sure I'd recommend this class. On one hand, the assignments do set deadlines and motivate a person to learn pandas and data manipulation.

And This course has great material and helps develop decent skills in working with Datafarmes, Series, and Pandas and Numpy libraries. Overall, I am happy with What I learned. But there are a couple IMPORTANT points to consider:1. The assignments requires a huge amount of self-study and it takes way more than the suggested time to complete. 2. The assignment grader may act up or be very picky on data types and do not credit you for the right answer3. The course can get very frustrating as the answer to the final question of assignment#4 determines whether you pass the course or not (it is 50% of the total grade!!). Although, you should be able to get to the right answer through the tips in the forum, it is really hard to figure out the solution on your own since there are many rooms for little mistakes which lead to the wrong answer.Suggestion: I think the questions should be designed in a way that there are small points for each step of the solution. So, We get to the solution step by step. Having 50% for just one final answer is not reasonable and makes it frustrating for the students.4. The course subscription is monthly and it makes it even more frustrating when you are stuck with a wrong answer that holds up course completion. I think where huge effort is required to pass the course, having a monthly subscription rather than one-time payment for the course, is not a good incentive at all, but it is very frustrating when you get close to the deadline and can't fix your code to get the answer. Finally, I want to thank Dr. Brooks and staff (specially Sophie) for the good course. I would like to sign up for the next course in this specialization. But I am debating since I don't want to get stuck with the unreasonable monthly subscription method and frustrating assignment grading system. Thanks,Ershad",0,0,Seyyed Ershad Sakkaki,3169839

On the one hand, finishing this course gives you some level of satisfaction due to the challenges and real world examples for you to work on. The Jupyter interface is excellent as a teaching tool by providing interactive code. However, there were several times where I thought this was more challenging than it needed to be and some improvements to pedagogy could be made. (To give you an idea of my skill level, I have coded in R for a few years and finished Dr. Chuck's entire Python specialization before starting this course.)  For example, in most standard lessons, a new concept is introduced and then a learner can practice that concept with a simple problem. That simple problem can be followed by progressively harder problems. However, in this course, we're often asked to try hard problems soon after seeing the concept for the first time which can be frustrating. In addition, the lessons are often too fast and some examples are presented unexplained. One idea that comes to mind is in the discussion of the merge function. It requires passing in references to ""left"" and ""right"" but the instructor never explains what these refer to. I figured it out eventually but saying explicitly that ""left refers to the first data frame and right refers to the second"" takes 5 seconds to say and spares the user from resolving the source of the terms. Seeking resources outside the course platform is required throughout. This is expected to supplement learning every now and then in different courses. However in this course, the degree of seeking outside help just seems so high that I could do this on my own while performing my own data science projects. I understand that this is probably the first iteration of the course and that they will likely find ways to improve it. The lessons and assignments seem akin to something you would do in a real job, so finishing the tasks provides some feeling of accomplishment.

Not all of us have a background in statistics.Tasks are implemented in the form of IPython notebooks (essentially a web page where one can write Python code) and rated by an automated rater, which sometimes gives good clues, but sometimes ""result was incorrect"" is all you get in response.

Students need more clear written information than just lecturing in Video as referring to lecture notes as needed would be more efficient. Each week assigns one programming assignment consisting of multiple problems. I don't think the shown expected time to complete each assignment is totally unrealistic. It took tremendous time to complete and at least to pass it. One good thing is that as far as you complete it within the session, there is no penalty and you can get the passing scores. However, all the programming is graded by the autograder which has a lot of bugs. For example, the exactly same solutions that was passed by the autograder as correct previously are graded as incorrect in the next trial. The staff people try to help but I totally don't understand their approach in that 'this may help but I am not sure if the autograder can accept it'.

The assignments are a lot of do-it-yourself by reading documentation and Q&A sites. So you're forced to read a lot, and learn more than actually necessary. Teacher and mentors gave hints on the discussion forum which helped. Could have been better if part of the solution is given. E.g. answer = 0.0073.........64 without actually giving the full answer. I also think the automatic grader should give an explanation or example of a correct answer when the assignment is answered correctly.

Much of my December vacation (which I had earmarked for playing video games) was spent coding on this course. The biggest gripe I have about the course is the grader system. It gives a binary output indicating whether you got the question right or wrong. Unfortunately, often that is not good enough, to debug your code. I spent hours figuring out what's going on. The forums were also not helpful, since there were not many taking the course.At the end of all this, if I ask myself, did I learn a lot? The answer is probably no. However, I did get a lot of coding experience. Debugging experience. We have many databases (MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, etc), which have far more powerful features than what pandas can do. Therefore, as a system designer, it is unclear to me as to why I would ever pick Pandas over the rest. It appears quite slow (compared to the likes of time tested databases). It offers very few features (when compared to a DB). Lastly, I can use it only with Python. To me, it appears to be a no-brainer to use any one of those DBs to store, modify and massage my data. Maybe there are valid applications that can make use of Pandas like features, but I did not learn that from the courseSummary:Better Motivation to use Pandas over standard DatabasesBetter grader design.

The biggest negative to the course (cost 1 star on my rating) are in the the layout and autograder for the assignments.  Most of the assignments require significant levels of work that have nothing to do with data science or the course material -e.g., doing web searches on which city a major league team is based out of, interpreting census data acronyms, etc.  This should be provided in some form of a summary or cheat sheet so the student can focus their time on learning the course material.

Make sure you already have Python fundamentals or you will work a little harder (I already had Python experience under my belt). The final project was a good first hands-on approach to doing something most employers would consider to be a real project. Since an autograder is used, the data sets were already provided, but one could imagine where one would have to acquire the data themselves and then follow similar procedures to accomplish a statistical task. My only complaints are: 1 (Minor): the attitude of some of the instructors in the Discussion Forums is off-putting. I don't know if this is a language barrier problem or if they truly just lack ""soft skills"" in working with people, but you have to take them with a grain of salt. Not all of them, but some in particular. 2 (Major): the autograder is years behind. The APIs (mostly Pandas) that you will use in real life have features that will work for your assignments, but then fail in the Autograder. I spent 1.5 to 2x as long on this month of the specialization due to how archaic the autograder is.  I will definitely be warning my employer about this if other people in my organization want to take the course.

The notebooks to for following along the videos are very good too. The assignment problems are also interesting, applicable and to a reasonable level of difficulty. However there is one significant problem which, while not big enough to stop me recommending the course, is very frustrating. The assignment auto-grader has so many issues and peculiarities that on the third and fourth assignments I have spent more time getting the autograder to accept my answers which are already correct, than I spent actually obtaining the answers in the first place. Just one example of such a problem is that the autograder works with an older version of pandas so there is some syntax which will work perfectly when ran in the jupyter notebook but which will fail when the autograder tries to run it. I know it is not practical to have all assignments reviewed by a real person but something needs to be done about this, when it can take more time to get the assignment submitted than to actually complete it. It would also be good to have access to optimised assignment solutions after the assignment has been passed because it is certainly possible to pass the assignments without having a very efficient or 'pandorable' solution.",0,0,Eric Neville,30932442

Great lectures and really good exercises to enforce what you have learnt.If you are wondering to do this course, and have reservations given the many reviews about the lack of spoon feeding, I would advise to still consider it. For some other courses, which have those kind of reviews, have often been spot on.However, personally, I found the balance to be good in this course. Learning to solve the problems yourself, with the safety net of a great discussion board and grader to tell you if you are right or wrong,  you will get there. The approach really allows personal development for problems without either of those two aids. Some have been disparaging about the over dependence on Stackover flow to help finish the exercises. I can see the frustration, but the Fundamentals were taught well, and learning to bridge the gap efficiently using Stack overflow is a large learning. ",0,0,Maximilian Warner,39706280

The lectures provide some good information, but only rarely do they go into WHY a particular action/method/approach is used or WHY it will be important later.

The assignments, while interesting, have the same issue as the lectures. Most of the time is spent using of Google to look up Pandas and Numpy functions or methods, or if we really get stuck, to see if someone on StackOverflow already addressed 
any questions you might have.Put simply, the only different between this class and learning from a book is the class sets deadlines for the students to meet in the form of graded assignments.

I took this course with the idea of covering some background in python skills in a structured manner, the goal being  to move many of my data science and some of my data processing code to python. I found the exercises useful. The lectures are not bad, I just felt they were an overview that either didn't connect much with some of the minutiae of the assignments or they were not always key to me given my background. Eg I found the week 2 videos more interesting; week 4 videos far less so especially the video about running a t-test in python (my statistical skillset is far more advanced).The real point of frustration is the grader which is extremely sensitive to slight variations. I feel there should be a feedback system where users/students document such cases that could then become a FAQ. Examples:Grader chokes on type but won't tell me: Submitting string 'True' instead of Boolean True. Grader chokes on useless (non)significant digits: using round(*,2) at one point crashes the submitted work.These ""errors"" are so slight that are almost beyond the human ability to catch them. The result is that, in part, the course turns from 'learning python skills' to 'getting to understand minutiae of what the grader does' which can be really frustrating.In sum, I believe there is value in this course but the grader is fairly broken and needs a FAQ or similar to warn re choke points generated from trivial differences.

The assignment that was supposed to take 2 hours ended up taking my whole Saturday and the 4 hour project at the end of the course pretty much consumed an entire weekend. This might not apply if you have previous experience in this development environment or are just smarter than me ;-) Not everything that you need to know to do the homework is provided in the lecture, so expect to spend a lot of time in StackOverflow.  The discussion forums are also very useful.  Sometimes a teaching assistant will offer some hints that make all the difference.One gripe I have is with the automated grader.  It's a great idea, but sometimes you can submit a fairly complicated bit of code and the only feedback you get from the grader is: ""Wrong!"".  My suggestion: have two data sets, one for testing and another for grading.  Then students could openly discuss and debug their test results in the discussion forums without violating the Honor Code.  They would still have to submit a valid algorithm to pass against the test data.",0,0,Howard Clark,9613568

For example, one assignment asks students to measure a decline in some value across a date period.  this could be a difference, or a ratio, but it wasn't stated in the assignment.  only in the forums was it clarified that we should calculate a ratio.  finally, the expected time requirements are very underestimated.

It is fast-paced and difficult yes, especially for those of us with limited python experience, but that kick it gives leaves you with some solid, immediately-applicable skills.Where it goes well: Strong content and excellent delivery.Fosters independence. The course starts from the basics but accelerates at a fast pace, introducing you to roots of concepts but expecting you to expand on them yourself with outside resources rather than rote-learning. In this manner it leaves you VERY prepared to tackle unscripted challenges.Concise content. The lectures videos themselves contain almost zero fluff. The lecturer conveys relevant information in a very smooth and efficient manner. Replaying specific parts to revise or solidify understanding becomes a pleasure due to this.Where it could be improved: Could be a more polished.Time estimates for the assignments were WAY off. I do not mind a challenging assignment, however if it advertises that it will take 3 hours, I would hope not to expect to spend closer to 20 hours, however this certainly was the case. Multiply the estimated time by 4-5 to get a more realistic time.The assignment wording can sometimes be a little ambiguous. It's almost mandatory to go through the forum posts for clarification.

I feel the following changes would give future participants even more value:First, assignment grading is too rigid.  There are questions I failed that looked perfectly OK to me.  If a question fails, hints on how to get it to pass need to be provided.  One great example had something like ""incorrect output.  Be sure that DataFrame.loc['Texas']['2012q3'] returns a float64"" or something like that.  I tried that, found out I didn't strip spaces (I had 'Texas '), sorted that out, and got the right answer.  I feel spending too much time on that is ""hacking the grader"" vs. learning the material.Second, the course emphasized following along in the notebook, playing with it, and doing the assignments via checking Google / Stack Overflow.  That works, but it doesn't lead to as ""Pandorable"" code as it could otherwise.  Some of my solutions were slow, and I started to get into ""one-trick pony"" mode using .apply() everywhere.

Give yourself time (a weekend or several evenings for each assignment) and you'll learn a lot.ConsVery little information is given in the way of conceptual understanding of data science as a discipline. Focuses on the ""how"" but not the ""why."" Not much context given for the examples, so they seem a bit contrived. (For the opposite extreme, see the John Hopkins Data Science specialization.)Lectures are rushed. Looks like the prof is reading cue cars straight down without pausing for the students to digest anything. (The one or two lectures given by the TA just fly by without nary a pause for breath.) If you're trying to follow along, keep your finger on the pause button.The Jupyter notebooks are useful, but contain minimal commenting (barely more than a few headers), so if you plan to refer to the notebooks later (for reference), you'll need to put comments in yourself.Given code is sometimes sloppy (e.g., standard Python naming conventions are not always followed.)The automated grader is very picky.

I really like the approach when you are given the basics and algorithms but you have to investigate the topic yourself to solve tasks - it's the most effective way to learn something. However I understand why some people may not like it. I would like to mention the forum support - all the questions are solved very-very quickly, thanks a lot to the teachers!The thing I didn't really like was the last assignment - 4 Qs out of 5 are the same... So if you manage to solve Q1 - others just require some boring data preparation, I understand that it happes in real life, but why here, it only takes time and annoys you?   I would recommend this course for those who has already worked with Python and knows all the basic classes and structures. If not - it's better to take some introductory course (it will be useful anyway, better to start with the fundamentals) .PS: I really don't understand the comments here of people wh0 complain that they had to go to stackoverflow or read documentation - that's what you do when you code",0,1,Maria Zhokhova,4075602

You will take way more time to complete the assignments than the time it is supposed to take and you'll probably take more time to watch the lessons also, since you have to pay a lot of attention + possibly rewatching. It is impossible to teach everything, there are too many tools and algorythms to learn, and I believe this course has the perfect balance between ""I'll teach you this"" and ""go learn this yourself"". Trying to do the assignments is where you'll get most of your knowledge. There are also ""complementary readings"" and ""complementary listening"" that add a lot to the content of the course as they discuss ethics/mindset and not only the the technical part of data science.The help provided by the staff in the forums is amazing, nothing to complain.IMPORTANT INFO *If you don't know how to program don't even try it, since only some necessary info about python is data science is taught in week 1 of the course. *At the end, this is excellent.

Stories of how people gave up halfway. The videos being distracting and useless. I almost didn't take the course because of them. I realise now, googling is actually the essence of coding. The videos of the course are not enough to pass the course or even understand the assignment. But that is how it is going to be in reality as well. No one expects you to remember syntaxes. You only need to be able to think up the logic, google your needs and hey presto - you'll have done the question in no time.

The ability to submit your assignments and have them automatically corrected, even if you are note paying for the certificate,  is great. 

I just think that maybe it is a ""too hard"" introduction. You must already know python, and, I'd say, should have already studied a little of pandas. The explanation of pandas is really quick, but full of valuable real world tips.

On the other hand if you spend time trying to develop the concepts not just with the contents or explanation in the lectures, went through forum discussion, asked queries after many failed attempts at the assignments and finally succeeded in completing the assignments then this course will boost your confidence like no other. The course needs to be restructured and the content needs to be revised to accommodate the effort so that the learners can actually learn by the time mentioned in the course description else a course prior to this will have to be introduced. Another approach would be to increase the explanation of the videos by focusing on the assignments, this could be done by increasing the number of weeks. I have elaborated so much because of all the negativity that's spreading around this course, it's really bad for the university, teachers, students and everyone related to the course, it could even jeopardize the name of Coursera, not exaggerating.

One habit the course has inculcated in me is to refer to the documentation and build my own solutions rather than blindly referring to stack overflow.All in all, a good course for someone already proficient in Python looking to develop expertise in Pandas. Not recommended for a complete novice though.",0,0,Haris Naveed,35787779

The discussion forums are helpful. Read through them before starting doing assignments might save time.Some expectations if the course material will be updated someday in the future:a. Have a short video to clarify or explain the questions in the assignments. If there are some common questions in the forum over the past years, there are reasons for them. A bit more information might be needed, eg. a math definition for a concept.b. The auto-grader is great, but it may not provide enough information on why the answer is wrong.

20417326~COURSE!~RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,1578330422720,5,0,"IN SHORTThis was a great course and I learnt a lot! Topics covered include a quick reminder on intermediate python and lots on pandas and some numpy. The weeks 3 and 4 assignments are quite challenging so expect to spend considerably more time than indicated on the course site if you're not experienced with python and pandas. This course is not for coding newbies.IN DETAILI am proficient in R for data analysis and had dabbled with python before although had no experience with pandas. I was committed to learn the course material and to spend a substantial amount of time doing so. The speed of lectures is fast. I paused often to take notes and to try out the provided notebooks, and I returned to some of the videos when working on the assignments. I found the course assignments good and challenging. The lectures give a good tour of different functions and approaches you may want to use in the assignments, but there isn't much handholding with the assignments and you'll most likely spend quite of bit of time looking things up online in pandas docs and stackoverflow. If you're used to that and generally troubleshooting code, you'll probably be just fine. I spent much more time on the assignments than what is estimated on the site: ~5h for week 2 (vs 1.5h indicated), ~1 day for week 3 (vs 2h), and 2.5 days for week 4 (vs 4h).Week 1 gives a refresher on how to write functions, list comprehensions, and lambdas in python. If you're familiar with writing loops and functions in other languages, with this material you will get to writing them in python quickly if you invest a bit of time and effort. If you're not yet at the level of confidently writing functions, loops and vectorized alternatives in python or another language, I'd recommend starting with a different, more basic course because the learning curve with this one might be too steep.Week 2 gives the ins and outs of pandas including creating and querying pandas series and data frames.Week 3 covers merging data frames, grouping (groupby) with aggregation (agg), applying functions rowwise (apply), and pivoting data (pivot_table) etc. It also gives a whirlwind tour of date/time manipulation using pandas. numpy is also included.Week 4 has some lectures on distributions and more on numpy. The week consists mainly of the main project assignment where 50% of points are given on data cleaning and munging (contents of weeks 1-3) and the other 50% of points are on modelling and hypothesis testing. It's quite a proper project in the sense that you're given a number of non-clean data files scraped from different places and a hypothesis to test. There are some additional instructions on what format of cleaned data to produce from the different files and what type of test to perform, but for the rest you're on your own.",0,0,Aino Järvelin,20417326

It won't be an easy course for anyone who is unfamiliar with programming. However, if you do have programming experience under your belt, you'll likely find this course strikes an excellent balance in terms of conciseness, practice, and theory. Each lecture is crafted carefully to teach you about some nuance of pandas or numpy, and the programming assignments are packed with coding questions that will help you revise what you have learned, in a very efficient way. There is very little ""fluff"" in this course, which is a major weakness I've seen in similar courses of its kind. Too much spoon feeding often does not challenge or engage the learner. The course is very direct about what it expects of its students. Every week there is a comment ""This week's assignment requires more self-learning than the last"". And true to its word, there is less and less hand-holding as you go further into the course. I thoroughly enjoyed the material and probably learned the most out of this course than any other course I've taken on Coursera, taking in to account its length.  ",0,0,Vinod Ganesh,39635716

It won't be an easy course for anyone who is unfamiliar with programming. However, if you do have programming experience under your belt, you'll likely find this course strikes an excellent balance in terms of conciseness, practice, and theory. Each lecture is crafted carefully to teach you about some nuance of pandas or numpy, and the programming assignments are packed with coding questions that will help you revise what you have learned, in a very efficient way. There is very little ""fluff"" in this course, which is a major weakness I've seen in similar courses of its kind. Too much spoon feeding often does not challenge or engage the learner. The course is very direct about what it expects of its students. Every week there is a comment ""This week's assignment requires more self-learning than the last"".

This course and specialization will teach you how to use all the commonly used Python libraries for Data Science applications (Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, NLTK etc.). And comparing to some of the other specializations I've taken in the field of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Maths after completing this one, I can say that the programming assignments are by far the best I've encountered on Coursera so far.

Before I started this course I had completed a few introductory Python courses, but never felt confident enough to perform standard analyses in Pandas. This course has changed that and I am now confidently using it in my day job as a Data Analyst, helping me to automate some workflows, analyse data much easier and so on! What is really great about this course is that it sets you up on Jupyter Notebooks to follow alongside each week's lectures, and then gives you an assignment to complete each week in a notebook. It really helped me get to grips with using notebooks, and debugging code and so on! As a Data Analyst, and budding Data Scientist, I cannot recommend this course enough!",0,0,Liam Gower,41538511

It should really be called Mastering Pandas for Data Science because despite the word introduction in it's name this course basically starts at an intermediate level and skips straight over teaching the basics of anything, including Pandas. You will have to already know quite well: Python, Pandas, Database style thinking and working, Statistics and Autograder intricacies. It basically took me well over 100 hours to get it done. If I had already learned Pandas or R elsewhere before it would have taken less than half that but basically everything I did had to be looked up on StackOverflow or in the Pandas documentation. However, at the end of it I feel like I actually know basic level Pandas and I am now intermediate level. In the end, a great course but very, very challenging.",0,30,Michael Nurse,18963180

There's no shortcut if you really want to learn Python and pandas. From dealing with real life data, I learned a lot in this course.

When you finally get the code right, you feel like you can solve any puzzle, because you can only get it right, when you completely understood why it's not giving the correct answer and you get those ""Ohhh, that's what's wrong"" moments all the time. So there is zero chance, that you will come out of this course having no idea what you actually learned. (Sadly a prevalent feeling at universities nowadays)Apart from that, there is zero handholding and you MUST understand basic programming concepts. When even the course masters specifically tell you, that you will have to ""google around"" for that one vital code snippet, they mean it. This irritated me at first, because I expected a course on something to be self-contained (except the pre-conditional knowledge of stats and programming). But after completing it, I realized, that a big part of the professional programmer's workflow indeed does consist of googling for an answer on stackoverflow, since one and the same problem can be solved using a myriad of ways.Big props to the creators of the assignments. Those were fire!Best regards from Germany. ",0,0,Jakob Bender,32053819

It also showed me how awesome Jupyter notebooks is to use. I'll be using it in all of my Python courses moving forward, whether or not the course requires it. I will say though that the estimates for the amount of time the courses will take per week are way too low. This is a problem I've encountered on every MOOC platform I've ever used though. They really just want to get you in and saying that you'll be spending 15 hours per week on a course will scare many people away. I've easily spent more than that for some weeks in this course. In the end though, I didn't feel that my time was wasted. The assignments are challenging and really force you to get better at Python if you want to try to solve them on your own and not immediately resort to the forums. I'm probably just a bit of a masochist that way, and it honestly may have doubled the amount of time it took to finish the course, but I find trying to solve the problems with as little guidance as possible very rewarding. You just become a better coder overall.However! If time is a major concern and masochism isn't your thing I highly recommend just giving it a go for only an hour or so if you're stuck end then going to the Discussion Forums. There are very useful posts there from the teaching assistants that will show you the most efficient ways of solving the problems the ""Pandorable"" way and save you gobs of time.

32998559~COURSE!~RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,1525719555862,5,0,"Like many others, I give this course a high rating while lodging a minor complaint that there wasn't much instruction provided. The lectures were excellent, if brief; it's hard to imagine anyone having objections to the instructor. But in terms of teaching the material, it was a bit of a drive-by. The lectures show a few examples, while not explaining the syntax or the various parameters. You have to draw that out of web sites and cheat sheets. If you're not adept at doing that, proceed with caution here. In the end, I was worn out from the effort, but felt that I had gained a lot. The assignments were challenging for me because this was my first hands-on experience with Python, much less with Pandas. I did not find Stack Overflow as helpful as the instructor suggested. Nor did I find much help in the forums, but that's not quite my style. My bottom line is that the course was time well-spent, but it could easily have been a six-week course with a more deliberate pace through the various pandas mechanisms such as merging and grouping. FWIW: My recommendation is to get to know Jupyter Notebook early and follow along with the lectures by opening the Week[x] files in the course download folder. You can pause the lecture while you go play with the code to make sure you understand it.  Also, I recommend working with a local version of Jupyter and keep your files local. Otherwise, Jupyter loses connection to the kernel, and stops being able to save your work. The messages are disconcerting, and if you've worked yourself into a frenzy, they can cause panic and confusion. So do all the work on your machine and then upload the whole assignment when you are finished.  You upload on the ""Create a Submission"" screen; it takes only a sec. You won't even have to worry about details like file paths; they'll be the same either way.  Once you get the hang of Jupyter, you can settle into a work routine.

Also, some more time on lambdas would really be appreciated given how important they seem to be in Pandas.Having said that it was a real pleasure going through the assignments, repeatedly debugging them and getting to the answer finally.

I would never have learned so much had the assignments just been a rehash of the lecture examples. I applied the material to real world data analysis in my field with very good results. I could not have done the computations I did, if I had not taken the course seriously. There could be more clarity in the assignments especially in week 3 and week 4 but then that's the fun too - in real world data, there is no instructor to watch your back.

As I am an R user, some things are intuitive (and maybe more easier for me to do in R), several of the things in comparison I thought: ""Wow, but this is so much easier on R"", but at other times I saw the power of Python for parsing tasks or webdata that in the R require too much memory or are more complicated to obtain. R have the problem to treat everything like an object and guided by vectors, but at some parts that makes understand coding details more deeply, at least for me.  I still think that the documentation of R the best there is for my purposes, so I will stick with that, but it's great to know how to develop some things in Python, mainly because of my goal of getting some applications to end users.

23381962~COURSE!~RZ1S0B0MEeacvQ6cODzg5Q,1484188101119,5,0,"I really like Prof. Brooks's way of teaching. He developed a very good introductory level course. Apart from some talks about data science in a whole, he concentrated on the preparatory work in this field -- data cleaning. Instead of delving into theories, he paid most of his attention to how to make things work by using python. I actually have a background in C, and I was a bit reluctant to learn python at first since C is already strong enough to attack most tasks. However, I have fallen in love with python now, and I think it is a much more suitable language for daily use especially when your projects aren't very large. Among its many merits, the best thing about python is of course its numerous libraries like numpy and pandas which free us from tedious low-level programming. I am quite convinced that I will move to python from now on.In addition to lectures, I truly recommend you go over extra reading materials. Those articles are very thought provoking. For example, the first one ""50 Years of Data Science"" totally changed my previous view towards this field. It made me realize that data science is not a simple combination of statistics and machine learning, that it is a distinct way of obtaining new knowledge, and that its advancement shall benefit the whole science society.About the assignments, those taught in the lecture are not enough and you should refer to python documents and stack overflow. I think knowing how to solve problems and where to find help is more important than solving problems itself, and that's why I consider those assignments well designed.Finally, thanks to all the efforts made by the teaching staff.",0,3,Zhenxun Zhuang,23381962

I've decided to take this class out of curiosity (and in order to get ideas about a class I'm about to teach), and even if I consider myself as 
an experienced pandas user (top5% on stackoverflow for [pandas]). I think it's pretty involved if you're new

This course deviates from many garbage MOOC who only work with quiz and can not provide a real python coding challenge experience. Assignements are really tough. But my sense of progress is real.(I have struggled to identify such feel in many pytyhon MOOC). Jupyter base for everythjng is a fantatsic format(it even allows coding mobility betwwen my station at work and my home station  through the coding on jupyter in the cloud) . My feedback nevertheless will point to some aspect in my experience and where I think you can improve. Succeeding the assignement does not mean that we identified the most elegant way to apply all the knowledge of the course(lambdas,list comprehension, grouping..., apply) in our coding. Breaking that barrier is not easy for me unless we are forced at it and so my looping mind is often applied in assignments. A real correction with the answer need to be provided(this is what the real classroom would do, we managed to get to the answer but we could still learn more with an assisted correction just like what the real classroom would do.I understand that you are worry that the model will end up as copy paste on a webpage and will kill your value. You could maybe consider this add_on for paid customers only and only provide it in picture way which can only be paper print and not so easily converted to webpage format.Or you need to find an alegant way to randomize the assignment coding test at each coursera session,  which  in that case would not bring any forgery issue and you could provide the correction at the end of the course(or after each assigment completed).Videos are a bit too fast on concepts sometimes. You could split the assigment in two formats:  format where simple principle of the course are first resolved on jupyter notebook (just like the videos case but with more exercices) and complex dataframe case as second assignment .(but please reduce the amounts of case to only 1 or 2, not 3) You could reduce dataframe case.(I've spend easily 40 hours on assigment here, assigment time is too heavy from my workload as a full time scientist.
