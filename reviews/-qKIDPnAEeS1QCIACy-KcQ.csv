However, I particularly think that focusing mainly on the game ""Scratch"", overshadows the importance of Programming as a profession. Sometimes it felt like I was learning how to play a game, only, and not actually taking a course on Programming. My suggestion would be to add more practical elements to this course, to make it feel more professional. There's one single video, for example, in which the instructor shows us in practice how a code would look like in a Programming language. It would've been good if this had happened more often. Showing real codes, exploring the programming languages, giving context to situations in which programmers put their abilities in practice, etc. ",0,1,Nayara Gabrielle Honorato,78655210

I do see the pratical benefits of students reviewing eachothers projects as this would be an impossible task for staff to undertake (lectures not given in real time, no funding for this, etc) but I have a gard time accepting that peers don’t give honest reviews and don’t take  the time to double check your code or try out different results in your assignments. If the dishonest reviews are based on hasty half heartened tries or just due to a lack of understanding the English language and the instructions given, I don’t know, but it bothers me that other people’s lack of engagement is what determines your final grade.

Areti is a very clear instructor that explained concepts very well for complete beginners into programming, like myself and I found the course insightful.1) Presentation - I couldn't help but wonder whether they had a lower target age (teenagers or younger) in mind, which was entertaining at some points but also distracting at other times. // Also, I only realized halfway through the course that it is in fact possible to see what Areti is doing on the Scratch program once the quality of the video is adjusted. 2) Projects/Time Commitment - Going through the lectures and quizzes are not time consuming at all, but the projects (especially the final project) takes a lot of time. It took longer than expected because I felt like much of the practical instructions on how to use Scratch for specific purposes were not provided during the course, leaving me to work by myself. 3) Discussion Forum - When I took the course, the discussion forum was close to being dead (especially compared to some of the other courses that I was taking simultaneously on Coursera). Gerry (mentor) did an amazing job responding to my inquiry, but I noticed that although there were a lot of students talking at the beginning, introducing themselves, there weren't that many discussions concerning the final assignment, making me feel like I was working alone. It would be great if there was more time to work on the final project, and perhaps a way in which students can collaborate and help out others when faced with a bug (ie preliminary project submission and feedback session).

The instructors planned the course in such a manner that a beginner can start thinking like a computer programmer.  Learning block programming is a good way to start to learn programming.   The learner has to really want to learn this stuff, and it is so rewarding when one creates something from Scratch that one is proud of.  It is also very rewarding to be able to follow along with another learner's though process because one is able to understand what the programmer is attempting to do.  From doing peer review, one learns from peer review, and the learner begins to understand why coding is such a collaborative effort.  It is truly insightful to see how someone else approaches a problem different from one's self.  I love this stuff!  Now I am going to have to take a course in some beginning language like Python.  When I can afford it, I am going to get this certificate.

I had knew basic programming in R, Python & Java, but it is so much more fun when you can see immediately your code in action via animations, games etc. Now I have to figure out how you go from the root language programs like Python onto visual ones like Scratch.I have some feedback on how the course could be improved - don't know where else to post this: a) the course description should emphasize that it uses Scratch V2, not the latest version, in bold, e.g in 'About this course' and 'Introductory note', so to download V2 to follow the course, and once completed continue practising using V3 b) there should be an additional 'FAQ' section in the course content list, gathering all recurrent threads from Forum Discussions, e.g. reminder to use Scratch V2 not V3, and differences between V2 & V3; this would reduce the incorrect uses of the Discussion Forums (e.g. multiple duplicate threads) and save time about known recurrent topics/issues  c) the project submission page should not allow submission unless a file has been uploaded to it, and if possible only a .sb2 or .sb3 file d) the peer-review process should indicate what to do if wrong file type or no file uploaded in the project page to review (from an old forum thread I gather that we have to flag the submission rather than submit a failed - on all counts - review).",0,0,Mireille Ferrandon,5885118

53360809~COURSE!~-qKIDPnAEeS1QCIACy-KcQ,1586729347937,5,0,"Honestly, I think Scratch, the programming tool used here, is better left for kids. This is a great tool to give kids an idea about programming and to get them interested. For adults, however, I think this is a very, very, very basic program, which teaches just the absolute basics of coding logically and thinking logically. I do not think Scratch has any real-life applications or use. I do not think the skills taught here allow you to do make anything practical, but it does let give you a bit of a taste about programming and teaches you very basic programming logic. But like I said, I just don't think Scratch is an appropriate tool and I think it should remain a coding tool for kids. I believe others are better off with an introductory course on something like Python instead, which isn't that hard either.Regardless, I've given the course 5 stars. For what it tries to do, it really does teach you Scratch in baby steps in a clear, practical way with some good projects to test your skill. It was made clear in the description they'd be using Scratch, hence I do not take off any stars from the instructors for that reason.If you really just want to see if you like coding at all, want to get at it in small steps or want to learn about the basics behind thinking as a software engineer, this course is fine for that. If you want to learn practical coding skills, it can be a stepping stone, but to some people this may just be a bit too easy and they're better off starting off with a more advanced course.",0,32,Johannes Gerardus Antonius Bekkers,53360809
