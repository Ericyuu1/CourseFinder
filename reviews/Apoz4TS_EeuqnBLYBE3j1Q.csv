7988724~COURSE!~Apoz4TS_EeuqnBLYBE3j1Q,1610994648269,4,0,"The course consists of a rather complicated project plus interesting botanical concepts. it is a project not a tutorial so the student must spend some time to understand the project. Fortunately, i completed a previous Coursera project on NetLogo but the this course uses the Web version so some things had to be relearned. I am giving 4 instead of 5 stars because my slowness caused an overrun of the Rhyme allotted time and I finished using 2 computers: one to read the project and another to do my portion. I recommend the project but it was not easy. But then, it looks like NetLogo isn't easy.",0,0,Charles Fischler,7988724
