Overall I think you're better off having some other basic ML exposure before doing this. The labs do expose you to Google Cloud ML toolkits. But frankly the ""labs"" aren't really labs as much as a series of click-thru steps to be followed. Feels like driving only with training wheels rather than actually testing any understanding. Since these Google Cloud ML areas are quite complex so they would have to spend a lot more time on the Lab setups to make these really Labs to learn from. Personally I would have been okay if a lab took 4-6 hours but really made us go through some of the details of ""WHY"" we are going through those steps rather than simply stepping through.The areas on Bias and Fairness are quite good in terms of making you think. Overall good started package. Some links on what to explore deeper in each area would also have been useful.",0,0,Pankaj Mhatre,1237178
