I had a break from the course to study and practice Javascript, Jquery and JSON, including autocomplete, and while I could complete all of the exercises and import  W3Schools examples into my own files and make them all work, I could never get the implementations in the assignments to work.2. I found that I mostly learnt about debugging code and trawling through the walk-throughs for little gems, rather that really learning the topics.3. I found a number of examples where there appeared to be deliberate mistakes or omissions in the exercises.4. I found most of the help messages from the forums very difficult to understand and needing a few days to decipher.5. None of my work was ever peer graded as far as I can tell.6. One of the things I'd like to do now is to create a database of audio files and pdf files,  to be able to be viewed, listened to and downloaded via a website. This course has not covered these topics.7. I found that the Coursera deadlines were quite unrealistic, and sometimes I needed a small fraction of the time while on other occasions a 3 hour deadline actually took 2 weeks to achieve.8. Over all I am pleased that I persevered with this course, and I feel that I have learnt a huge amount about the  overall world of web coding.
