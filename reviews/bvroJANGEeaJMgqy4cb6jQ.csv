Even though I admire the way the information was delivered I quickly grew tired of the quiz show and guests and the system of tests that was consistent throughout the course made me annoyed. I understood the material but these tests want you to show how well you remember tiny nuances which makes no point at all. Also, rewriting lesson plans becomes a burden and creative tasks do not excite me anymore. I wish the course was different from the previous ones, now I just feel like I want to take a break from learning.

It's confusing, focusing on theory and research of the habits of good language learners. Teachers need practical advice they can implement, strategies to plan and implement L&S goals and activities.

My concerns are the lack of compatibility with the app (the online course & app never show the same information & it's impossible to access the website from a mobile device without being forced to download/use the app). The other is having to review classmates' assignments. For some reason, I find with these courses that the other students submit assignments that do not follow directions, making it impossible at times to move forward in my own progress. For example, the final required a video submission via Youtube link or direct upload but I came across so many students who submitted links for Google videos (you need an account to view), gigantic formats that were not openable, students who submitted videos of them teaching what was taught directly to us teachers rather than to language-learning students, etc. It seems also that with written assignments, so many students didn't quite grasp the instructions/concept of the assignment.

Although it was full of theoretical terminologies like assimilation, para linguistics, etc., it was done is the most interesting way possible. Yes, there is lots of information is the particular course but I agree that it is important with everyone working in the TESOL field to be familiar with them. I appreciate all the huge effort and work that the staff made to make the listening, speaking and pronunciation strategies as clear and easy to follow up as possible. The idea of the game show and competition was fabulous. It was nice to include new members in the videos as a change. Their contribution was nice as well. I liked the character of the quiz show host, Art and the controlling Clarafication as well. It helped me follow up with the flow of the lectures and be focused and eventually enjoy the videos. I was inspired by all the ideas you gave us to design and implement speaking and listening activities. I was inspired the most by the pronunciation module because I have almost never thought of talking about pronunciation in my training room. I though that is something that students will pick up automatically from other activities because I use visual aids (especially videos) a lot as part of the interactive activities. Thank you so much for such a fruitful course. ",0,5,Fatina,11209564
