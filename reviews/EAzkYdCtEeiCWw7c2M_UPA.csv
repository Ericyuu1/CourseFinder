The 5th quiz was extremely difficult, as it seemed none of the content was discussed by her. Also, the interview in week was a complete waste of my time, seemed like Hogan was just winging it and gained no valuable information. The modules with Hogan truly need work.

102916522~COURSE!~EAzkYdCtEeiCWw7c2M_UPA,1666722157896,2,0,"I​ suggest the professor could give more examples. It is very hard for students who have never learned Research or Surveys to understand theories with few examples. Also, I think there should be more help in the weekly discussion forum. Specifically, TAs or even professors could help students to answer their questions. Please do not just upload materials or leave reminders. Answering students' questions, understanding their needs, and giving help.  This is a course about caring for users' needs so students' needs should be considered. Please read the comments on the weekly discussion forums, make changes, and give bits of help. Do not pretend to miss students' needs anymore. ",0,0,Nancy LAN,102916522
25388914~COURSE!~EAzkYdCtEeiCWw7c2M_UPA,1658216278894,2,0,"The fisrts part of the course was very good and comprehensive so did the assignment for week 4. However the data analysing part though it had great information it had impossible assignments. I have to mention that I have a bachlor degree in Sociology and a Masters in Statistics and it still was imposible to complete it as the course does not cover what the assignment requires. Also the questions in the quizes are the perfect example on how not to make a questions. Very difficult for non enghlish speakers. I did all the theory, quizes, first assignment and quit for the last two as the requirements very intangible .",0,0,Iulia Balint,25388914

37899598~COURSE!~EAzkYdCtEeiCWw7c2M_UPA,1569411488137,2,0,The course was very difficult for me as the couse assignments were not clearly outlined. It looked like that Mr. Lampe finished his complete lecture at one go and he was always in hurry. However I was able to understand his lectures and finish the assignments. But I was very confused during the lecture of the second teacher as her lectures seemed to be complex and unclear. The lectures and the assignments were not cohesive as many tasks were not covered during the lecture. I hope in the future the assignmets will be given after providing concrete examples in the lectures. Otherwise it would make it very difficult to finish an online coures in due time. ,0,22,Riazul Islam,37899598
82042709~COURSE!~EAzkYdCtEeiCWw7c2M_UPA,1628548421788,3,0,"The content is good, but one of the professor's work is disjointed and what she says in the video lecture does not necessarily align with what is on the screen. I think a lot of her lectures needs to be more fleshed out, it seems we are reviewing haphazard notes at times. I'm not a numbers/math person at all, and the assumption that we can evaluate trends and numbers was frustrating. Some may, but not everybody can. Half the content for one of the quizzes isn't in that week's learning either, but is relevant for the next week, and the other half of the content is relevant to the prior week.There are also a LOT of videos for this course, and some are very lengthy, so it definitely gets tedious. Like I said earlier, the content is good, but the delivery or content and review on the professor's part needs to be worked on.",0,1,Michael Vorhees,82042709
81829723~COURSE!~EAzkYdCtEeiCWw7c2M_UPA,1623575200100,3,0,"Overall, this course teaches you some great practices for forming research questions and designing and conducting surveys. After week 4, the other instructor takes over and there is a big drop in terms of depth and thoroughness of the course material. It only superficially touches upon the practices around Remote testing and A/B testing, and the Week 6 assignment is completely out of touch with the course material.",0,1,Maarten Lodewijk,81829723
63068059~COURSE!~EAzkYdCtEeiCWw7c2M_UPA,1613750699297,3,0,"I think this course has great materials. However, it has the worst quiz design I've ever seen. Funny how I'm taking a course in designing survey questions, yet the quiz questions that were designed by the instructors are so horrible. They ask you to choose the ""least true"", ""most false"", ""not uncommon"" option. I'm like??? Why don't you follow the rules you teach about writing short, simple questions that reduce cognitive burdens?",0,5,Gloria Wu,63068059

She also spoke in a way that was extremely superfluous so it was difficult to absorb her lecture material.  And the first quiz she gave asked questions about material she hadn't covered yet.  So I had to google my way through it.  Then when I started the next week's lesson, oh look there it was.  Extremely frustrating.  I enjoyed her round-table discussion with other members of the UX Research community as well as the final project.  But overall, her section of this course was very frustrating.  The beginning section was great!  The male professor who started us off was very enjoyable and his lessons were easy to comprehend.

To be honest, I was expecting to learn more about HOW to analyze data and what each metric means and then how to leverage the product from this information but I found this module to be rather superficial. Anyhow, regarding the other 2 main subjects of the course, they do explain some important concepts such as data types, sampling, best practices for survey design, usability scales, etc. Overall I now feel more confident about these topics which I think is a good outcome for the course!",0,2,Grace María Cabana Hernández,20166835
