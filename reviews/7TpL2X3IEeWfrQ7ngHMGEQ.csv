A review of circuits is advisable, if you have not touched on the basics for a while.I strongly advise to keep good notes, including homework/quiz assignments. They help as reference as you move through the course. The course material and homework assignments could be better aligned.  This is after all not a university level course, so I think it should not create situations where you have to spend a lot of time researching information outside the course material.  I had to invest significantly more time then shown in the Course time estimates.  If you plan to take all courses in the specialisation, investing in the Dr Erickson's text book is not a bad idea, but is not an absolute must.But if you get through, there is definitely a sense of accomplishment and I personally feel satisfied with the knowledge gained as an introduction to converter circuits.",0,0,Andrew Wihler,21050705

However, as with many other MOOCs, there is a lack of collaboration between students and a lack of a tutor or a moderator who can give you a hint if you get stuck with the homework. I have been in the semiconductor industry for 3 decades. This online learning refresher was great for me, and in today's work environment, most things are done remotely as well. What this course does not offer is talking about the subject, writing, sharing, explaining things to others. Communication is also critical for engineering succcess and I guess this could be much better integrated by Coursera. The discussion forum offered by Coursera is not at all what I know from today's students who all studied remotely during the pandemic.In basically, you can just work through the book ""Fundamentals of Power Electronics"" by Robert W. Erickson and Dragan Maksimoviƒá, but I like the lecture and the exercises with a deadline really motivate me to do something even if I don't need the certificate.Btw, I need at least the same time for homework as for listening to the lecture and sometimes much more.

Good news, supplemental reading on google is fair enough to help you get over most hurdles.Bad news - some homework questions aren't exactly straightforward from the notes.... but, SUCH IS LIFE. Its the same as you local college so dig in and go figure it out, somehow and make use of the re-sits.Overall, good job. I have learnt a lot and hope I can make it to the end.

First lessons on semiconductor physics were a bit challenging but detailed enough to get a hold of the operation of semiconductor switches.

Even though you have to work so hard to deal with the homeworks, you are going to learn a lot. Professor Erickson is a great master in his field and he explains so clear. I really recommend this course to those who love electronics and want to develop their own projects. ",0,0,Carlos Fernando Hernandez Prada,759393
