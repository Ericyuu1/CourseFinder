12543380~COURSE!~EqpUUBhZEequJA6C7Fjv7Q,1629350094963,2,0,​i did not like this course. The visual material is 'old style' power point with very text heavy slides which at times had cheezy 'clip art' animations of dice or students switching chairs running at a high speed in the background. (The purpose was to illustrate chance events.) The professors are well qualified but the visual material was so poor and distracting to me I decided not to finish this course and seek a better one. I suggest a total re-do of the visual material with a designer and modern graphics. ,0,0,Sophia Collier,12543380
