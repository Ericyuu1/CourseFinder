67720692~COURSE!~A0LoWgzBEeuK9g5tRr2svQ,1675631935834,3,0,"This course is as good as its leader. On a meme scale, I would say Noah is chaotic good. He seems exceptionally resourceful and pragmatic. Indeed, he shares many valuable tips to make things work and provides a friendly intro to the CI/CD and cloud topics. However, in doing so, he makes messy environments and provides advice stemming from his practical experience over a more structured rationale e.g. creating an issue to upload images to a repo README. His preference for results over ordered process is just not to my liking. ",0,0,Maciej Lulka,67720692

Nonetheless, from the perspective of a student, I've come to understand what differentiates the ""great"" universities from the very good. Once again, being blunt to the point of discomfort, a great teacher will cover the topic of the class with a perfect amount of complexity, completely saturating the exploration of the important concepts. This means that specific points are allocated appropriate amounts of repetition, the breadth of key notions match their relevance, the examples are exhaustive and scale in difficulty adequately, the simplification is elegant, etc. etc. The teacher of this course is very respectable, and one should be very, very content having him as a mentor. However, there is a moment of enlightenment that occurs when one experiences an exemplary teacher.

You will get to the basics of cloud deployment, with hands-on example for all 3 major platforms. However, I didn't realize some of the holes in my background until I took this course.  It contains a ton of practical DevOps background, linux, virtual environment setup/management, linting, github tricks, etc..It does start off with 'technical communication', which feels kind of silly when you want to learn concrete technical info.
