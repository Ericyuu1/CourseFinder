I was also hoping that using constraint modeling means you don't have to worry about efficiency. Sadly this course spent a lot of time focusing on efficiency issues.

I'm also definitely moving on to the next course in Advanced Modeling ASAP.  And while I found most of the general concepts fairly straightforward (I've solved most of these sorts of problems before in Excel Solver in some form or another), I was also frustrated by large gaps between the content taught in each section and the workshops at the end of that section (things I learned in each set of videos were often totally irrelevant to the later workshops and assignments), unnecessarily vague variable names (such as lower-case 'l' which looks just like the number '1' and is used in several examples), lack of downloadable example files to support the various videos, a fairly obtuse help system in MiniZinc itself that makes looking up keywords fairly difficult, sudden jumps in difficulty between the sections, too much time spent on topics irrelevant to the course (such as formatting of ""output"" statements, which takes the whole second half of the video for the week 4 workshop), and lots of little discrepancies between the PDF files for the various workshops and assignments and the actual workshops and assignments.  This is a good course but would be a stellar one with a bit more polish to the MiniZinc help system, more polished examples, a better learning curve, and downloadable MiniZinc samples to accompany each video (really, just providing the MiniZinc files that are shown in the videos, along with a bit of reasonable sample data, would help a lot here).",0,0,Paul Tozour,41839327

It's still very workable but you should know.Most of my difficulties in completing the assignments and workshops were in understanding the language in the problem statement. Sometimes it seemed like Hong Kong and Australian English might be a little bit different then american english, or maybe it's on purpose. I'm not sure. These were minor though, and eventually I figured it out each time, although twice I did need to search the forums for clarity.It's obvious they put a lot of work in to make it more polished than the average class, with the Three Kingdoms theme especially.
