10788681~COURSE!~xN5chpCiEeqqOhJwEK9AFw,1603641989372,3,0,"I learned about what seems to be a very useful tool for visualizing and analyzing data sets. I would have been able to engage more with a couple of up front examples of how i could use this network mapping -- what types of data sets could I explore and how. Also, some of the features described didn't match the actual tool, and in the last step i could not find the same SNA diagram to create and so it wouldn't work as the instructor did. All in all though thanks! ",0,0,Andy Takats,10788681
