30463878~COURSE!~M-45KyN0EeqCgRKukXAJ-Q,1638751526872,1,0,"T​he course was quite shallow, and the actual challenges of model selection, training or building appropriate augmentation steps were pre-built and not discussed in any detail.The coding challenges were using badly outdated package versions, for which documentation does not exist anymore and which do not represent best practice usage of the libraries involved.O​n top of that, the coding challenges expect a very specific solution, while not considering equivalent implementations as correct (case in point: In the week 3 coding challenge, I used np.transpose where the challenge used np.moveaxis. I prefer transpose since it clearly and explicitly states where _all_ the other axis go, while moveaxis makes that change of state implicitly.)Finally, the grading of the last coding challenge does not respect the special cases that are explicitly mentioned in the excercise itself. The ""standardize"" function to be implemented explicitly mentions the possibility of a slice having a zero standard deviation and the pre-coded framework handles this special case correctly. However, if one changes the selection of the slice in the cell before, which the user is encouraged to do, it is possible to obtain an empty slice. The grader expects a unit standard deviation though, without checking this edge case.T​he shallow content and lackluster excercises, as well as the common mistakes in the presentation videos (sometimes corrected by a ""question"" popup during playback) do not give the impression this course was prepared well.",0,0,Julian Schweizer,30463878

The good news is that you can sign up for a 7 day free trial and finish it before 7 days are over, so you're not out of any money, just your time. What do you learn? Some new metrics that are specific to medicine (specificity, sensitivity) and the concept of class imbalance (prevalence). The code assignments are designed by someone who understands the concepts well but is unable to teach some of them well (I'm being super critical here, coming from the viewpoint of someone who might spend $49 for a month on this).  At the end, I'm unsure what you can say you learned and if you can really demonstrate any concepts in a job interview at a healthcare (adjacent) job. There was some demonstration of segmentation, but a lot of it is really left up to the learner to experiment and learn from. You could talk about these things in a job interview, but a technical round would quickly discover that your knowledge is surface and not really in depth. My 2 cents (stars?).
