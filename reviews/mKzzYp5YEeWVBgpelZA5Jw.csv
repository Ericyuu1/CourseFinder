The tools used in the course are a little bit outdated. It was not a big deal to me though. Note, I did not check the latest release 4.0 of Android Studio yet.

The material is well organized and sufficient for beginners. By the last date of the the course I DID complete all the lessons and assignments. It was a tremendous feeling and the credit goes to the course setup. The exemplar apps  seem trivial during introduction of the course and you wonder if they are too simple for a wannabe app developer but as the course progresses its evident why you need to learn developing them.
