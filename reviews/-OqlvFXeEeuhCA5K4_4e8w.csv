77279681~COURSE!~-OqlvFXeEeuhCA5K4_4e8w,1672263070721,5,0,"This course is a great source to learn the basics of graph data structures and algorithms, as the name of the course suggests. The only problem is last week's assignment in my opinion.  The final assignment seems extremely daunting at first glance but using the pseudo-code provided, it becomes trivial. I felt like I didn't learn anything from the last week's assignment., and it kinda felt like cheating! Apart from that though, a really great course.",0,0,Sina Salemi Sarmast,77279681

16762173~COURSE!~-OqlvFXeEeuhCA5K4_4e8w,1652069111477,5,0,"This is probably the closest you can get to a univesity course in Data Structures and Algorithms.The lectures are detailed yet concise. Not too mathy but also not the easiest. The quizzes solidifies your understandings and corrects your misundertandings.There seems to be inconcistencies in the quality in programming assignments but overall, for example the programming assignment in MST encourage the ""bad"" use of dictionaries, while in the Shortest Path programing assignment, it encourages more clever use of data structures (i.e. idx). Still, overall, the programming assignments are good and they make you appreciate more the lessons. ",0,1,Rusty Mina,16762173
98787547~COURSE!~-OqlvFXeEeuhCA5K4_4e8w,1650825072405,5,0,"Pretty thorough. Lectures are great, and quizzes help test your understanding. The assignments do the job, and, are at times, a bit of a puzzle to figure out. I enjoyed the lectures and felt like I learned and was challanged. One will need more practice and study to achieve mastery following the course, but you'll defintiely come out of it with a far greater understanding of the trees and graphs.",0,0,Jeffrey Concerto,98787547
