40694183~COURSE!~MjZjgvnpEealaBJvc-7qqA,1616815618789,3,0,"I learned a lot from this course, and I would love to say 5 stars!!However, I really feel that I spent too much time for debugging code. Especially, timeout issue of the very last assignment was hard. I think over 95 % of my time was spent for debugging in this course (Introduction to Programming in C). Therefore, lecture should also provide much more example of codes which are not efficient or have bug, and teach student how to find and fix it.Teacher said jumping in to start writing code without spending enough time is very bad idea, because in the end the person will waste so much time. Preparation is very very important.I think it is same for lecture assignments. Ask student to do assignment without providing enough example will waste student's time. Teacher needs to show a lot of bad example to student so that we learn why it is bad, how we can avoid it.",0,0,shohei kotani,40694183

32102705~COURSE!~MjZjgvnpEealaBJvc-7qqA,1528636585876,3,0,"This course it the 4th and final course in the ""Introduction to Programming in C"" specialization from Duke University here on Coursera. This review will be for this course in particular and the specialization as a whole since I see no other way to review the entire specialization. First comes the good things. This course reinforced what I learned about pointers in the previous course and it also showed me how to get my C programs to accept input from the command line and how to make those programs read/write to/from other files in a system. If I look at the specialization as a whole it reinforced C basics (which I already knew going in), really improved my understanding of pointers in general, gave me a basic understanding of Makefiles, as well as all the other things I've already mentioned. From a standpoint of understanding the C language I was very pleased with what I learned here.It isn't all sunshine and roses however. This specialization in general, and the final projects for each course in particular, are an exercise in frustration. The general problem with this course, and the entire series, is that your connection to server where you do all of your work is prone to kick you out, seemingly at random, with no notice whatsoever. Also, once you're kicked out, there can sometimes be delays before you can get back in again. I've encountered this on multiple networks, web browsers, and operating systems. I would STRONGLY recommend setting up Cygwin (if you run Windows), or copying the project over to your computer if you're running Mac or Linux, and doing your work locally. Then copy it back to the server to submit for grading. While this is inconvenient it still isn't as bad as being in the middle of your project and suddenly losing all ability to work on it.The final projects for the courses are the worst. All grading is done automatically by scripts on the host machine. When your program fails, and it will fail, you aren't given enough information to be able to correct it. For example, prior to submitting one program I verified it against all of the supplied test cases and also verified with valgrind that it did not have any memory errors. When I submitted it the grader informed me that valgrind detected memory errors. Where were these errors? What sort of errors were they? I didn't know because I didn't have access to the valgrind output from the grader. What input condition led to these errors? I had no idea because I can't see what input the grader provides to my code. So I know that something is wrong but I don't know what it is or even what causes it to happen. And I'm supposed to fix this somehow?On another program the grader only told me that a particular line number in my code's output did not match the expected value. What was the expected output? I have no clue as this isn't listed in project documentation or grader feedback. What was my code's output? No idea as I don't know what input condition led to this problem in the first place. Once again I'm left guessing as to what might be wrong and what might have caused the problem to appear. Due to this lack of feedback I could not have passed this course or the previous one in the series if I hadn't found the instructors' email addresses and worked directly with them on the projects. This really bothers me as I've made a living for many years doing testing and QA work on a variety of hardware and software. If I submit a bug and all it says is ""something is wrong"" I can expect to hear from the designer/programmer asking for more information. If they ask me what input I gave the program, or what power level I applied to a device under test, and I tell them to guess - I can expect to hear from my supervisor and probably theirs too. The feedback you get from the grader is simply inadequate and unprofessional. Improving this one aspect would take this course, and the entire specialization, up to 5 star status.",0,15,Stephen Link,32102705
69527582~COURSE!~MjZjgvnpEealaBJvc-7qqA,1664379337576,4,0,"W​ill try to leave realistic comments as much as possible. 1. I wish there were more videos, not just reading assignments.  Readings are everywhere on the web; it's the videos that attract learners. I would say for every ONE video correspond around 5 reading assignments. Would be great if that ratio were 1 to 2~3. Having said that, however, the quality of videos is fantastic. Step-by-step instructions that illustrates the ""under-the-hood"" mechanics of the C language is instructional and challenging in a healthy way. 2. The assignments can take a long time for two reasons: i) the assignment itself is challenging (e.g. the coding has multiple for loops that require careful attention) or ii) the technical aspects of submitting the work are time-consuming. Often times, learners will inevitably ""waste"" a lot of time on ii). If you want everything in your education to go smoothly, then you should avoid this course. However I believe that overcoming such technical difficulty is part of learning coding, computer science, and really anything in general. O​verall I would recommend this course to those who wish to learn the basics of low-level languages. If you care only about immediate application with not much of ""under-the-hood"" knowledge, just go for Python (which by the way is C-derived) or something high-level.",0,0,Brian Choi,69527582
75617316~COURSE!~MjZjgvnpEealaBJvc-7qqA,1658331004606,4,0,"I learned so much in this course.  I was a programmer for 8 years (15 years ago) but was self-taught.  This course helped me relearn most of what I knew plus taught me many things I didn't know from being self-taught and limited to working for one company doing the same C-programming work.There are two complaints about this course.a) I PERSONALLY (so take it with a grain of salt) that the poker project was too difficult for a ""Beginner"" course in C.b) They treated (again in my humble opinion) double pointers the same as any other topic.  I felt they should have spent MORE time on double pointers before pushing us into the poker project.  So, I suggest any BEGINNER to understand that the 3rd and 4th course WILL take a LONG time and should be done after much practice.  Don't think you can finish them quickly!I would suggest 3 months of C practice after 2nd course then 3 more months of C practice after 3rd course.But, it was a very good course.
