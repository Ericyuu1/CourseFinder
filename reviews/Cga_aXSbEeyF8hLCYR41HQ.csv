111491864~COURSE!~Cga_aXSbEeyF8hLCYR41HQ,1677126720121,4,0,"I enjoyed this course, and you can see that Professor Solomon put a lot of time and energy into it, including bringing in knowledgeable guests and doing little skits with them.I do wish the course went more in-depth with some topics; although I know it's a beginner-level course, some of the content seemed more simplified than other courses of the same level. Additionally, my favorite part was the video lesson in the 7th module, when Professor Solomon was interacting with the elephants. I think the best online courses are those where the instructor isn't just reading a script the whole time, and I wish the instructor talked a little more naturally about the material (like he does with the elephants) to make the videos more like traditional learning. I did get a lot out of this course, though, and I plan to do the specialization. ",0,0,Danielle Bauman-Epstein,111491864

104291575~COURSE!~Cga_aXSbEeyF8hLCYR41HQ,1670164392520,5,0,"I was very glad to learn the foundations of ecology in this edifying course. Prof. Scott Solomon's lectures are lucid and very well structured. The material is easy to learn but substantive.  This knowledge complements perfectly what I learned in his Intro to Evolution course. I am now on to Dr. Solomon's third course.

On to Biodiversity! 
Thank you, Rice University! :)
