I have learnt more  about the United Nations (UN) and its specialize agencies such as the International labour Organization (ILO), World Health Organization (WHO), etc. I have leant about the structure of the UN, the member countries, its objective for being and how it carries out its various functions.T‚Äãhe shifting context of International Organizations was discussed extensively in relation to hierachies and networks as these also relate to current global challenges such as trade, climate change and internet governance. T‚Äãhe course further dicussed how the Secretary General can create space through strategic alignment and the submissions of  two key Management Specialists were reviewed  - Michael Porter and John Kotter. The example of Dag Hammrskjold, the second Secretary General of the UN was elaborated upon as a good example of someone who intervened and successfully createdd space during a very trying period and between two powers, China and the US.I‚Äã appreciated the topic on Private Public Partnerships (PPP), the drivers such as complex societal challenges, restricted resources and reach of market. The risks were also highlighted such as governance structure potential conflicts of interest and asymteric power relations and lack of transparency. Further thought was given on Partenership Life Cyle and Operational Model from the preparation, Implementation and reveiw and renewal phases. I‚Äãn preparing a PPP, it is important to have shared vision and purpose, time and capacity, internal support capacity and a welcoming culture.F‚Äãinally, the role of marketing and fundraising for international organizations was discussed. The need for build a marketing plan, to manage the Brand which is the IO's identity, the brand process and in fundraising, build a case for support. i‚Äã appreciated the emphasis on the government managed IOs because it enabled me to visualize the challenges of bringing nations with different authorizing environments together to collaborate and build a future of sustainable goals that would positively impact billions of people. For profit organizations, the objectives are very clear and concise. There may be deviations but it would not differ too far from the core organizational goals.H‚Äãowever, this course has enabled me to have a better appreciation for the effort it takes for many international organizations to continuously work together with civil societies, governments and businesses to achieve goals.",0,0,Olubimpe Eboegbune,44560200
