Although few things that I think might help improve the coursei) Course only implements K-Means which is a very simple algorithm, instead of this or in addition to this implementation of few advanced algorithms like DBSCAN or CHAMELEON should be added.ii) A no. of times prof only seems to be reading the slides which make things a little bit unclear i.e, the sentences used should be more common or explanatory rather than just reading the slides which the student itself can.Apart from these things I truly enjoyed and learned many new things.Thank you everyone involved in developing this course",0,1,ADARSHPANDEY,10879408

I found the lecture material unclear or vague at times, so that for certain topics understanding heavily depends on one diving through the provided reading material (which I found very helpful). However, the topic of evaluation is very dense in the lectures and the provided book chapters do not provide relevant insights as well, making the programming assignment for this part quite challenging (at least if not already deeply familiar already with the concepts involved).

3232448~COURSE!~2NULnOvKEeWtYRLS6TLjGQ,1504367117791,4,0,"Good, thorough coverage -- for a 4-week course -- of how to cluster.  I liked the evaluation of clustering topic especially.  Very few other instructors seem to discuss the vitally important evaluation of clustering results in any depth when they teach clustering.  Dr. Han explained a comprehensive framework for understanding the effectiveness of any clustering system.  I had never seen some of this material before, even though clustering was a topic appearing in a couple of other data science or machine learning courses that I have taken in the past.  Ideally I would even wish to see this course extended to 6 or 8 weeks, so that case studies on difficult real datasets can be clustered.  For example I had a terribly difficult ordeal last year before I took this course, trying to cluster the Kaggle.com dataset of the BOSCH competition.  It has about 90% missing data in every row, and there are 2 million rows in total, and about 4500 columns!  Kaggle's BOSCH is a SUPER tough dataset to work with!  I hope to come back to try the BOSCH dataset again using my new knowledge of clustering some time soon.  The reason I chose to run unsupervised clustering on this BOSCH dataset, which is ostensibly intended for supervised learning, is to eliminate significant amounts of the missing data from being exposed to multiple individual supervised learning models by prior clever grouping of examples.  I am still postulating to the current day that clustering and creating another unique supervised learning model for each cluster is the most important step to eliminating missing data in this particular problem.",0,0,geoffrey anderson,3232448
