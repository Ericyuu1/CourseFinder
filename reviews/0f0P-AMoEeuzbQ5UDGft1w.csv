112860770~COURSE!~0f0P-AMoEeuzbQ5UDGft1w,1672528731003,1,0,I took this course hoping to be enlightened with data and facts and to get an alternative side of the issues such that as a white person I could hopefully assist in some way.  But there is nothing here.  It is mere pandering to a victims mentality and the spewing of radical leftist dogma.  Shame on the University of Michigan.,0,0,KIP BROWN,112860770

5457606~COURSE!~0f0P-AMoEeuzbQ5UDGft1w,1620439000611,4,0,I thought this was a great class. I really enjoyed hearing all the perspectives from the community leaders in Ann Arbor and those who put together so many great programs there. I just wish that more similar programs were available in my area or that I had the means to put some of them to work.,0,0,Angela Ryan,5457606
