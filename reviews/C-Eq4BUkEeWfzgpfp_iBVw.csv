36573323~COURSE!~C-Eq4BUkEeWfzgpfp_iBVw,1573718609022,1,0,另外我想表達一下自己對Kierkegaard和本課程的看法，引用委員會對他的論文的評價是最準確的：冗長和情感。整個課程彷彿就是Kierkegaard不斷的重複socrates，socrates，socrates，socrates。但是我個人覺得，Kierkegaard不過是穿著一個大人制服的孩子，他並沒有學到socrates那種啟發和驚醒世人，而更像是一個因為身世不幸，內心創傷而到處挑釁的人罷了，他也沒有那種沈穩對待別人提問的能力，瞧瞧他被批評之後的樣子，總是暴跳如雷，他正是這種愛挑釁別人自己卻不敢經受批判的而優化自己思想的人，這也和蘇格拉底的初衷完全相悖，他更像是一個相對主義的sophist。Kierkegaard本身在學術上沒有什麼值得稱頌的建樹，他崇拜蘇格拉底，到處都可以看到他引用蘇格拉底，但是他似乎把蘇格拉底當作一種權威在使用，這也恰好和蘇格拉底的本身價值是相悖的，西方哲學史發展就是建立在批判一個時代的學術權威，運用人類的邏輯方式去建立新的系統性知識，這個知識要具有客觀性，普遍性，以及理性。蘇格拉底另一點區別於sophist是他的觀點中，區別於客觀真理的主觀真理，是以倫理道德作為核心的，這也是對相對主義最好的批判，我們不能為自己的慾望和客觀的條件去建立我們的知識，而是用一種自然法的方式，建立一直人性的自然法，他是有普遍性的，那就是倫理學的誕生。蘇格拉底作為西方哲學史的起點，而起點只能有一個，起點之後就是永無窮盡的射線，這個起點之後，我們已經知道哲學家是能夠建立系統的那幫傢伙，Kierkegaard這種到處宣洩不滿的小子，根本稱不上是一個哲學家，拿著蘇格拉底衣服上的一點點衣料，將這塊衣料跟自己能夠容易理解的宗教，社會和個人生活不斷比較，寫出了大量毫無意義的廢話和個人感情，不過是一個著作較多的雜文作家，正是和這個課程如出一轍。這裏是一個不能得分的答案：Kierkegaard什麼都沒有學會，他只是人類歷史上無數個崇拜蘇格拉底的普通的思維碎片化情緒化的壞脾氣小子。,0,2,Shem,36573323

It covers all his life and Jon Stewart is clearly very knowledgeable on the subject and explains it with passion which created interest and engagement. Unfortunately, I found three aspects that could improve and hence the low rate. Firstly I think the content became a bit too repetitive and seeing the extent of Kierkegaard´s publications, there is really no shortage of content to focus on. Secondly, I think the best part of the course was the interviews with expert scholars so I would have included more of this, and even created some sort of debate between them. Finally, I think the course focuses too much on the historical context and wastes too much time on aspects not directly related to philosophy.
