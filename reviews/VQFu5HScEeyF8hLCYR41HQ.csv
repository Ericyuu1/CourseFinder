64006374~COURSE!~VQFu5HScEeyF8hLCYR41HQ,1674846506917,4,0,"Very informative and interesting, and as the name suggests, its an introduction, so it doesn't dive deep into the subject, since it would require previous knowledge on the matter from the students. I think its great for starters, since all the main ideas are clarified. I didn't do some assignements, since I was doing the ""free"" version. Yet, I answered all the questions and I do believe this course is very well done. I learned a lot, and I fully recommend it. ",0,0,André William Segala,64006374

The course is easy, but you retain a lot of useful information and, importantly, a solid overall understanding of and good strong about evolution and its mechanisms. Prof. Scott Solomon does an admirable job. I look forward to taking his other Coursera courses.
