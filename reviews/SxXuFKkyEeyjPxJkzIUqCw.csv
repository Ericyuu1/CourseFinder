Was thrown a bunch of command line code (apparently its a beginner course, so they just assumed that you are familiar with CLI).Furthermore, they abstracted away the main working code of this project -> the python script that cloud function actually runs behind the scenes. You will have to screenshot those codes to work through them on your own time. Just a waste of money. The least Google can do is to go through the code. They were like -> oh create a bucket and throw and bunch of code at you and thats it. ",0,0,Sammya Majumdar,39932083
