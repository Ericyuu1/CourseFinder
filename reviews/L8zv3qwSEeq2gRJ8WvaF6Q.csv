1286782~COURSE!~L8zv3qwSEeq2gRJ8WvaF6Q,1658188910283,5,0,"At a certain point in my journey, reflective questions have started to come strongly to make me rethink how I'm designing, creating and integrating processes and solutions: Are they inclusive? Are they meaningful? Do they solve a real problem? Do they create impact? From this unconfortable state in the last 4 years, positive learning has been awakened, and the key question (is continuously welcome) : ""Who are you designing for""? I am very grateful for the University of Toronto and Institute for Gender and Economy by opening my mind and giving me courageous possibilities to try (and think!) and not be afraid to fail. Empathy-based research, Problem Reframing, new ideas and others amazing strategies and techniques are transformative ways to bring honest and inclusive solutions. Thanks, Sarah Kaplan, @MarkLeung, Nika Stelman and Coursera for your generosity in teaching the world with human-centered design. I recommend this learning experience and, YES, #Spreadtheworld ! #designthinking #design #inclusivedesign #inclusiveleadership #empathydrivesinnovation #innovation #universityoftoronto #GenderAnalytics #humancentereddesign ",0,0,Cristiane da Costa Gonçalves,1286782

The instructors' mastery of the subject is well demonstrated in how this course was designed. Relative to other course I took in this platform, this especially kept me motivated, engaged, and stimulated from start to finish. There's no time pressure in longer exercises (the ones that utilized the HCD worksheet), which is a major struggle for online course takers like me. The recaps and quizzes are substantial in retaining necessary knowledge, contrary to being just another roadblock to finishing. ",0,0,ur roomie gert,74012781
