66292002~COURSE!~fSYSDnzBEem9KBLXx7HZ1A,1625334579091,2,0,"This course seems very very dated, as it was clearly made in 2017 (at least 4 of the 5 modules). If ever there had been a time to update the course it would have been during the pandemic as health inequities have been glaring. The social media stuff was already dated. It seemed very ironic, in the last module, when one of the lecturers talked about how paper journals were a thing of the past, because information is immediately out-of-date. I laughed out loud at that. I was disappointed by this missed opportunity that this course might have been given the current exceptionally relevant time and think that it should be more transparent, upfront, when courses are old like this.
