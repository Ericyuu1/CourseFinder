However it has its share of problems :-little to no interaction from TA's or mentors in the forums-the quizzes are often out of sync with the lectures-the final exam has severe problems with questions (form not content).In more detail, on the final exam, some of the questions don't even contain all the content to answer them. They can request multiple answers but have single question boxes and/or the reverse. ",0,1,Cliff Stamp,18228502
