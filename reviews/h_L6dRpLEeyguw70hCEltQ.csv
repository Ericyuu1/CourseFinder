Either he makes mistakes or the slide deck needs to be reviewed, because there are some discrepancies.This is not the kind of material that lends itself well to online learning.Don't take this course.",0,1,Joseph Leibrandt,23088292
45775049~COURSE!~h_L6dRpLEeyguw70hCEltQ,1660606735483,1,0,"The course is content rich but the dry reading of slides that are bascially available on the NIST website does NOT promote learning efficiently.  I view this particualr course as a Presenter in a meeting reading the slides (which are cut & pasted from NIST) with the spearkers back to the audience.I belive this course could be improved in several ways:1) the videos should be ""stage setters"" for the content2) the content is best consumed via reading, not listening.3) there should be downloadable simple one-pagers to reinforce learning 5/23/97.  The spread sheet is dense and takes 16 pages to print the entire CSF reference3) there are multiple times in each weeks curriculum that your hear ""next slide"" but the slides do not advance4) the quizes should be done at the end of each week, not an all or nothing test at week 75) the currrent format is unusable on a mobile phone as the slide text is too small 6) this should NOT be a 7 week course.  I completed in 2 days.  Now I have previous security experience with PCI DSS and ITIL processess so that helped7) the presentor should not exhaust the informative references everytime as that is easily consumed off the NIST spread sheet8) I have completed over 10 other Coursera topics and thought that content (mostly Machine Learning) was exceptionally well currated, the videos made sense, the exercises reinforced the learning topic, and the quizes were timely.  Many of those courses were presented by Andrew Ng (co-founder of Coursera) and truly a top notch luminary in the AI/ML field.  As such, this material is by defintion a bit ""dry"" and difficult to inspirationally convey this type of material.  That being said, reading a list of lists does not promote the power of the Coursera platform",0,1,Kevin Milliken,45775049

I don't want someone to just drone an info dump. I realize that the framework is descriptive by nature, but I want prescriptive examples taken from the lecturers real-world experience, even if it is just an idealized scenario walk-through for an admitedly idealized organization. Very few sentances begin with ""For example...""",0,2,John Boyd,84428162

Although I have experience in NIST 800-30, I learned a lot, I am very comfortable with the knowledge I have acquired. I appreciate the scholarship you have given me.  Suggestion:  1) It would be possible to do 4 exams, since the course has approximately 170 Slides / 96 pages. Besides the questions are quite detailed.           a) CSF Component (Core, Tiers and Profiles)           b) Risk Management Frameworks          c) Nist Cybersecurity Frameworks ( Functions, Categories, Sub categories and )          d) 7 Steps CSF Process  2) Some slides are very small (Resource and budget decision making (GAPS))  3) It would be possible to have a copy of some Resource and budget decision making (GAPS) slides, since there is a lot of experience with them.",0,0,Rodolfo Hill,20791156
