Because this wasn't done in a Jupyter Notebook, I wouldn't realize that I had an error anywhere in my code until I ran the whole file. And I'd have to rerun it multiple times because you'd only get one error message at a time. This would've been better handled in Jupyter Notebook where you can run individual code blocks and more easily catch individual errors as you write up the code.Also, in one of the videos, the instructor neglects to point out a lot of miscellaneous edits made to the code (he obviously cut out a few portions from the video where he made edits), so it became very confusing as I was trying to compare my code to his in order to debug.I ended up running out of time because of these issues. I ended up spending way more time trying to debug my code rather than trying to understand what my code was doing.",0,0,Teruki Ito,13899512
