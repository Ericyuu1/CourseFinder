I have tried to work with Coursera customer support, and they recommend leaving a message to  the instructors in the discussion forum.  Note the circular (and hopeless) referral path.  I have taken more than 25 courses with Coursera, and this is the most disappointing.",0,0,Murray Sondergard,14340688
