But nothing should excuse coursera or the teachers from technical difficulty experienced by many (dozens of students) with grading. Who is at fault? You wasted my time. And you let dozens of students collide head-on without warning into this problem.  You should, at the very least admit to your failure and more importantly compensate me one full course at no charge. Without compensation, i see no reason to trust you.  Equally important, Coursera is an off-line teach ing system. I make mistakes. I get so little feedback, your system blocks my learning.
