This combined with a wealth of resources including online tools and an in depth reading list. Then it is all brought to life by the course structure and delivery--Dr's Oakley, Sejnowski, and Joyner don't just talk about how to teach effectively online, they do it. Thank you for creating a great course to cap off the other two courses.",0,0,Petra Williams,94208599
