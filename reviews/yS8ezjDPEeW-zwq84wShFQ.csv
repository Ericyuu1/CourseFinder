Much easier that I had already read much of Plato and then could read the excerpts for the test or I would have had a real difficult time getting through this course.  It was difficult because you had to do a lot of the reading and sometimes it wasn't clear what answers where expected from the reading, perhaps my reading comprehension isn't as good as it should be.

I wasn't game to try the quizzes until I had downloaded the book on my iPad and read chapter six, glad I did and will use this as my weekly process.  Enjoying this course very much. Week 2 quizzes were more testing, took three attempts at both quiz 3 and quiz 4 even though I passed on first attempt: 4 out of 6 / 4 out of 6; 4 out of 6 / 4 out of 6; 5 out of 6 / 6 out of 6. I like the dialogue format and that the language style is in modern conversational English. Socrates guy is hard to please, but he still forces us to think after 2,000 years. Pity the Greeks don't have him around today, their economy might be in better shape. The dentist at our local shopping centre is called Socrates but I don't believe they are related.
