51078878~COURSE!~0z3Dqt-HEemJkg5ELbNw1g,1640712905933,4,0,I completed this course over my winter break from graduate school. I was able to work on my time and submit assignments by the due date in order to be peer viewed. Even though this course is based in South Africa many of the scenarios are generalized and can be related to USA education system. This course helped me to reflect on my own teachings as well as gain worldly experience from other users and the guest speakers. Only disadvantage - when you get answer wrong on the quiz it does not tell you the right one. For many of them you were allowed four attempts to eventually get there. ,0,0,Juliana M,51078878
