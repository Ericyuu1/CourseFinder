88131079~COURSE!~2V0wzzYyEeuFYg7AZmoFgw,1630510766863,2,0,Information is ok but quizzes are terrible and often do not accept answers unless spelled in the exact way author requires. even adding an s can cause it to be marked wrong. I have even copied things word for word from readings or transcripts to try and make it work but still not luck. I have submitted flags but have not heard back. I will not complete the course because it is too frustrating.,0,0,Paul Namaste,88131079
9447702~COURSE!~2V0wzzYyEeuFYg7AZmoFgw,1672465155804,3,0,"I debated between giving this course two stars or three stars and decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and give it three, since there is some useful information contained with it, despite its many flaws. The main issues with the course are that many of the links to external webpages for further knowledge no longer exist, on the quizzes there are fill-in-the-blank questions that are next to impossible to get for some of them since they expect an exact answer to get correct, there are some incorrect answers on the quizzes, and there are a few typos here and there that should have been fixed before posting the course. Maybe this course does deserve a two, not that I type out all those negatives... But, I won't lower it. I'm just too nice.",0,0,Dan Tinsley,9447702
38301107~COURSE!~2V0wzzYyEeuFYg7AZmoFgw,1653669484339,3,0,"The course could have gone into it a little more. Too many broken reading links. Fill-in quiz boxes and some radio options would mark you incorrect if you were, indeed, correct. I should have reported more on those than I did. I will still try the next course in the specialiation and see how it goes.",0,0,Dorothy Louise McGee,38301107

77515715~COURSE!~2V0wzzYyEeuFYg7AZmoFgw,1662597523337,4,0,"The content and teaching format are excellent.  The information is easy to understand and the fact that he repeatedly mentions he does not have a math or computer science background is extremely reassuringg for those of us who are changing careers and coming from a non-data-specific background !The unfortunate and frustrating parts were the non-working links and the fill in the blank questions that did not allow for variation other than a very specifically worded response that was hard to determine.  For example ~ ""Factor Analysis"" was correct for one but only ""Factor"" was acceptable for a similar question with the same answer.  ""Six"" was not accepted but ""6"" was, etc.  The content itself is great, tho! ",0,0,Cathy,77515715
