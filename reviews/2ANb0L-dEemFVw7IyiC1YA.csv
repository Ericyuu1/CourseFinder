36870028~COURSE!~2ANb0L-dEemFVw7IyiC1YA,1598892622782,1,0, I did not enjoy this course as it contain unwanted quiz numericals and this course is very brief... And not at all able to understand all concepts. It even should contain some solved numericals and a detailed information and explanation. ,0,3,Anjali Kumawat,36870028
