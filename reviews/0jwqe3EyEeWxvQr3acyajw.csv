I appreciated learning about survey techniques such as vignettes that can be used to access beliefs and behaviors ""in the wild,"" but I must say that it was difficult to maintain my interest as we seemed to circle around over and over again to various ""expectations."" Perhaps the second course in the series will contain more practical content.The video content with embedded questions is a sophisticated method of tracking attention, and I found that answering the in-video questions kept me engaged.The comments by the other participants were somewhat uninspired.I appreciated the glossary of terms in the resource pack, although there was no definition of a ""prudential normative belief"" which was mentioned several times in the videos.The video quality was good, and production values excellent.It would have been nice to have some of the flowcharts provided in pdf form for later review as a resource.",0,11,Charlie Jackson,346886

I find the knowledge from this course useful not only for social workers, but also for community-oriented researchers, or anyone who would like to understand or make a change in a community. Most of this course is an introduction to technical terms, gradually introducing us how to look at certain behaviours of people in any communities, helping us know what such behaviours are made of and how we should start in order to make a change to it. Things I find especially interesting are actually in the last week of the lecture, where the professor had introduced to me tips and tricks for measuring outcomes and making surveys that could actually get quality information - something I never knew how to do and had never expected to know and realise that it would matter so much. As for the downside, it may be either because I am not familiar with terms in the social and humanity fields or because English is not my mother language, but I find that the professor sometimes uses words too sophisticated, when in reality I thought it would be better if she could have used simpler terms and vocabularies both in the video and the readings - sometimes I find myself becoming confused by her excess uses of fancy words and stretching something that could be briefly explained too much for my liking.

It helps me know when a system has intentionally engaged in a bad social norm and can either allow such a norm to thrive by developing it further or by abandoning same. A  social norm is a rule of behavior such that people have a conditional preference for following it. Also, pluralistic ignorance exists when personal normative beliefs are not in line with their normative expectations and this is how bad norms often can survive. Furthermore, in the case of social norms, we can define pluralistic ignorance in such a manner that 1. Norm consistent behaviour is observed, 2. infer that people endorse the norm, even if they do not. 3. There is no transparent communication. Most systems that we find ourselves in especially in the sub-saharan Africa are usually of a toxic nature and abandonment of such toxic environment will require an appropriate intervention procedure.
