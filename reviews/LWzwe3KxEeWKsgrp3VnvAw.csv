601372~COURSE!~LWzwe3KxEeWKsgrp3VnvAw,1479517629925,1,0,"I was not impressed. (And not impressed with this automatically centered text box either.) There was far too much very technical detail that no one save those working for hedge fund developers would ever use. The volume of analysis they suggest is overwhelming and impossible for the average investor, and when all is said and done, worthless. The market moves on news, rumors, scandal, etc; think Enron, Worldcom, Texaco, et al. None of the concepts presented in this course would have prevented you from investing in those companies when they were beginning or in their prime. I'm about to become a registered investment advisor. I took this course looking for ideas to improve my recommendations. No go. This was terrible. In addition, the presentation was presented by automatons I think. They rarely looked at us, they read flatly from the prompter. A good text to speech program could easily have replaced the ""teachers"". ",0,3,Tom Schaber,601372
