76425415~COURSE!~JwG-kuBNEemOxxIXN39M3A,1612100970389,1,0,  Never recieved my grade. Contacted coursera support. They demanded another motnh of payment for the course or else I will not get my grade. Terrible practice and this is used to punish people that finish their course early since coursera will simply wait until you pay another month before the start grading your paper!  ,0,2,Max Koopman,76425415
69072792~COURSE!~JwG-kuBNEemOxxIXN39M3A,1639465750947,3,0,"Overall the course was great and should get five stars. But week 3 was so poor and frustrating that I cannot recommend this course before this is fixed (the tutor just reading his code very quickly, and the assignment instructions totally unclear - a lot of people seem to simply give up).",0,1,Martin Flechl,69072792
41381207~COURSE!~JwG-kuBNEemOxxIXN39M3A,1618585071909,3,0,"I really wanted to like this class. I got a lot out of the first two, but very little from this one.  As others have hinted, this class is really not like the first two, it is much less general.. it does not just require stats knowledge, but is framed for stats people by stats people, using a library written by someone who does not seem to be clear on python or OOP libraries.  There is very little discussion about what you are doing or why, instead treating it like an extension of a stats course where you are learning the function names for various combinations of techniques, but is not really an introduction to the mechanics of the library or of the techniques, with lots of links to 'go read this research paper'.  Great for academics studying stats, but the utility to a more general deep learning audience (like the other 2 classes) is limited.it would probably do well as a stand alone class, but feels out of place in this specialization.   The actual topics are really fascinating and worth learning, but the framing is a real barrier to that.but others got a lot out of it, so take my review with a grain of salt.

6861657~COURSE!~JwG-kuBNEemOxxIXN39M3A,1615323953041,3,0,Only reason I gave 3 stars is it is definitely NOT a 5 week course. It took me a good 2 months (with a week or so of being pulled off to work commitments). It covers a lot of concepts which need a ton of background. It is dependent on the previous two TF2.0 specialization courses but this specialization is sorely missing one more 5 week course in between the 2nd and 3rd course and that is the Statistics Concepts. Without this I felt that I could not take advantage of the great introduction to all the tools in the Prob deep learning with TF2.0 course.,0,4,Omkar Karve,6861657
78359491~COURSE!~JwG-kuBNEemOxxIXN39M3A,1668865255875,4,0,"Great course (really I absolutely enjoyed it), but this course is finished by peer rated project, where you have to wait for an extended period of time and hope, that someone will review your capstone project, otherwise you are stuck. Since this is an older course, it is completely random when it happens and if you want to receive your ceritificate you just have to wait and pay up. WTF.... ",0,1,Branislav Doubek,78359491

85423180~COURSE!~JwG-kuBNEemOxxIXN39M3A,1638021581035,4,0,The course is very interesting  but you need to be willing to invest time on learning or refreshing key statistics concepts (which is fun!Most of the teachers are good.  But there is one particular week where the PhD student goes really fast in his explanations and the programming assignment has some issues.

15230117~COURSE!~JwG-kuBNEemOxxIXN39M3A,1603715789858,4,0,"Taught concepts were highly interesting and the video lectures were really great. They were very clear and pedagogical. Most TAs had pretty good walkthroughs too.Why I cannot rate a perfect 5/5 is because many of the lab assignments contained warts and/or misleading instructions that need polish. However, as the course organizer has been frequenting the discussion forum and been very quick to adjust instructions when pointed out by participants, I'm sure the course has already improved greatly. My experience was a bit confused at times however, and I wasn't sure if I had done mistakes or if the automatic judge has bugs, at times.Overall, I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in learning a modern API for generative modelling. I'm sure I'll come back to the more difficult concepts like the autoregressive trick in normalizing flows, and the change of variable formula, and hopefully having done this course will make those concepts a bit more familiar next time around for me.Thanks for providing this course material! The future is truly now for online education. :D",0,6,Carl Thomé,15230117

I've never build a neural network and though I read 4 or 5 books on the topic my Python  and machine learning background was a bit weak. Buy the recommended Manning book on probabilistic deep learning. I read it cover to cover and it helped a lot. Also recommend getting a text on mathematics for machine learning to get a grasp of some of the mathematics presented. I learned so much in the specialization 3 courses and highly recommend this course/specialization.
