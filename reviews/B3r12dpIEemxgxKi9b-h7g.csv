The assignments were never posted on the ""Instructions"" tab; they are posted in the ""My Submission"" tab, which makes no sense. Dr. Pohl knows his stuff and I feel confident in that, however we need typed notes. His handwritting can be hard to read at times. Finally, this isn't part of the course but the peer review process is unfair at times. 1 bad review can lead to a failure in the assignment. I had that happen multiple times, then reposted the SAME submission and got full marks. This needs to be reviewed by a TA of some sort if possible.",0,3,Jaron Wong,98405913

Nobody can deny that Prof. Ira Pohl knows a lot of C. His book is fantastic, That's why we expect so much about this course. And that's why is sometimes disappointing.  This could be a 5 stars course but it isn't. So be prepared : 1 - Even if you took course 1 , this will be tough. 2- If we could interact somehow with prof. Ira that would return a fantastic knowledge,  The only interaction with him is watch the videos. 3- Somebody has to help prof. Ira, he seems a bit lost in the videos, which probably were recorded at his house or at his office desk, the slides ( if we can call that slides) are hand written and very difficult to understand. I bet that record him in front a blackboard would be more productive. 4- The forums are completely waste of time, it's a nobody's land.  The only thing that you gonna find there is : ""Pls review my assignment that I'll review yours"" and there are hundreds of it ( not joking !). 5- Peer review is terrible. A lot of people just submitting empty or anything to have access to other assignments that really compiles and work. The result is that sometimes you catch 4, 5 codes exactly the same and you can't guess who copied who, this is forbidden but a lot of people are just ignoring and copying. So, if you are a diligent student and don't care about these thing and all you want to do is learning ,for real, you probably would have some success but all by yourself. You'll have to have C books to consulting and google to search for concepts. You'll end up learning , but through the hard way. It's a shame because there is so much of experience that prof. Ira could pass, but you know,  sometime it's not like the way we think. It's up to you to decide.",0,4,Fabio Barcello Sipoli Dos Reis Muller,386527
