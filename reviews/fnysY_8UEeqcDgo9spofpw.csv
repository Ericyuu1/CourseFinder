102395038~COURSE!~fnysY_8UEeqcDgo9spofpw,1651780986536,3,0,"The course was too focused on only one aspect of diversity, that being mental or physical disabilities. The issues of race, gender, sexual orientation, and others were never addressed at all. Ironically, mental and physical disabilities are the aspects of diversity where the administrations already put much of their focus. As an educator, I am just as intersted in finding out how my teaching can be improved to address other matters of diversity. ",0,7,Shawn O Farrell,102395038

19723736~COURSE!~fnysY_8UEeqcDgo9spofpw,1631932437352,4,0,"I felt this course was an excellent introduction to the concepts that will enhance my teaching for all learners. The speakers were very clear. The activities were great. Particularly the discussion questions. I liked that. I want to note a minor inconvenience with the system (I think this is a Coursera setup issue rather than an issue with the class itself). The issue was that as I was typing in assignments whenever the website would autosaved it deleted the last sentence I had typed. For me I just began doing them in MS-Word to save the hassle, but it might be worth contacting Coursera directly or perhaps warning the learners prior to the assignments. Some folks get rather riled up when their words are lost--even if it is only a few sentences. Apart from that, the content was stellar and I really wish I had the funds to pursue the M-ed advertised at the end of the course! ",0,1,Colin T Strine,19723736

For example, why a student isnt responding or coming to class regularly. The course also guides us to think about how to find flexible ways to include the needs of most learners in a way that it doesnt hamper the needs of other students. Furthermore, the course provides deep insights into how differences could be due to social and environmental factors and not just due to different abilities.  ",0,0,Ferina B,102744207
