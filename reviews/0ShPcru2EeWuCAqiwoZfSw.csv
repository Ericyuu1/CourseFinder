Prof. Williams' on screen energy was engaging.Those who want their work to stand for what it is should not take this course.  Grading is done by other students of the course.  Marks were all over the board, with no ability to redress obvious faults.  You can score the minimum mark in the same catagory that you score the maximum.  Language skills are an issue.

Prof Williams talks about numerous examples (together with reading materials) coming from experiences in North America, India, Africa and Asia. Students are always asked to consider their own social contexts in their writing assignments.""The course is outdated because it is based on based on DSM-IV"" A section of the course (2013) deals with the history of the DSM, while some examples were taken from the latest DSM at that time (DSM-IV), Prof WIlliams was always clear that DSM-V was forthcoming and in fact, she included a video talking about DSM-V when it came out in 2014.""The course felt more like a commentary, than actually learning about certain topics"" The course is not just about learning about ""certain topics.""
