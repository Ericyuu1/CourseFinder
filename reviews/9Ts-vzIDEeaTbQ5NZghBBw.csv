70082105~COURSE!~9Ts-vzIDEeaTbQ5NZghBBw,1617960304407,3,0,"Has some interesting bits about Chinese history, is however in part pretty biased and also uses, in my eyes, misleading comparisons sometimes, e.g. using only home ownership rates to compare wealth levels for different countries which is arguably an imperfect proxy measurement. In Germany, for example, the home ownership rate is one of the lowest in the world, but I would not say that Germans are particularly poor or poorer than people from countries with higher home ownership rates simply because they are more likely to rent than to buy homes.

Part 1 puts the revolution in a new perspective and connects imperial China with contemporary China. The course also throws a light on equality vs inequality globally and in China. The course is controversial in that it reflects duly and appropriately the complexity of Chinese social history and its development as opposed to the black-and-white view on China which still persists in the West.
