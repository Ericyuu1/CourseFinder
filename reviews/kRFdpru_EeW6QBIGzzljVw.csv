- There are errors in the ""calculations"" which have not been corrected for 4 years (many students criticized that in the notes) 
- There are no slides with correctly defined formulas but the lecturer writes them down with inconsistent variables and explains everything on the go instead of giving some definitions and background information - as many students wrote in the forum, I also had to look stuff up on Investopedia.
- The point before makes it very hard for beginners. I have a degree in business information systems and just had to look up some correct formulas on Investopedia as it was not correctly written by the lecturer. For people who are new to finance, this will be a hard one. They have literally no idea what the lecturer is talking about (also stated in the forum).

I'm okay with the fact that no one is answering learners' questions on the discussion forum because there could be no obligation for Rice University to do so, but the content itself is absolute disappointment. Despite her spectacular skills on writing in mirror, the lecturer jumps around concepts too quickly and I often have to find certain information on google, as these are not being covered in videos but will appear on quizzes, which is really frustrating and annoying. She probably thought she had explained the concepts well by using synonyms. For example, the slides say this is a conventional way, and she'll say 'so it's typical, it is what it is, right?'. Most of the time, she doesn't tell us what par values, market values and face values are.
