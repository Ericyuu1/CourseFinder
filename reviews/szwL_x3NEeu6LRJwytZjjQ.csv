5624440~COURSE!~szwL_x3NEeu6LRJwytZjjQ,1676059035968,3,0,"As an audited course (no certificate at end): although it gives good outlines of steps, it relies heavily on historical narratives without connecting them to the steps in a way that those who are not paying for the certification may get.  It repeats a lot in places.  But the last week is the most beneficial.Also, the audited course version does not allow a ""skip"" or ""mark completed"" button for assignments that are inaccessible to auditors versus paid students.",0,0,Courtenay Rose Mooy,5624440
69118480~COURSE!~szwL_x3NEeu6LRJwytZjjQ,1628041896472,5,0,You know when you're learning from someone who is SO immersed in their field of study that every sentence they speak seems to illuminate a path? The instructors of this class were like that. There were so many incredible insights and practical steps that I had to keep a side google document just so that I didn't lose track. The course is well designed and practical and empowering. Time to be a doer. ,0,0,Jennifer Cousteils,69118480
