69257550~COURSE!~pN1q2mI-Eeqcdg4GDbIftw,1676818308996,5,0,"All of the courses in this specialization have been really well done.  He does a great job explaining and building knowledge in the videos, paired with very useful reading resources.   He is very transparent in every course that it's going to take some time on your own reading, perhaps watching the videos multiple times, and just somewhat mulling through until it makes sense.  I'm excited about being able to use what I learned in this course and apply it to some data I have on education.  ",0,0,stephanie weiblen,69257550
20878579~COURSE!~pN1q2mI-Eeqcdg4GDbIftw,1652029809260,5,0,I think this was another excellent course in the specialisation. The emphasis in this course was on introducing a wide range of visualisations so there necessarily was less emphasis on the data wrangling aspects. I think the lectures are very clearly delivered and the R code provided has  useful comments to explain each step.  I think after this course I could return to each of the visualisations introduced and would have a solid foundation to develop each one further for my own requirements. I would recommend this course.,0,0,Peter Burbage,20878579

14340688~COURSE!~pN1q2mI-Eeqcdg4GDbIftw,1615220801296,5,0,"This course is a bit different from others I have done on Coursera.  In this instance, the instructor provides a general overview of the topic and then points the student to the broad array of online resources that are out there to assist the learner in developing their understanding of the subject.  I think this is a very good approach for an applied subject like data visualization, which is essentially a ""learn by doing"" activity.  I found the approach to be well-suited to my learning style.",0,0,Murray Sondergard,14340688
