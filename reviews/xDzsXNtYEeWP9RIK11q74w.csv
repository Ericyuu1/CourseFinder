However, I would think this course is more difficult than other beginner astrophysics course that I have completed in coursera/Edx, due to the fact that some concepts were not fully explained in the video. A.K.A. it requires some background knowledge of basic astrophysics principles. Luckily I did, so I was able to pass all the tests. Might be quite difficult for a true beginner. Another tip is to play the videos in 1.25-1.5x speed, as Professor speaks slowly (but clearly). The ""reading"" time of the wiki sections is also much longer than other courses, which requires some effort of concentration. The course might benefit from converting some reading materials to videos so that students can understand and concentrate better.
