87539084~COURSE!~7YEze_JHEeyxiRKaoDccyw,1677020080172,3,0,"The content was really interesting and provoked great thinking! I will be re-reading some of the content in the future. However,  the length of the course is incredibly incorrect and misleading. The ""10-minute"" readings vary from 10-25 pages OR an hour-long podcast. Only 2 readings had the time stated match even slightly close to the time it took to complete. Additionally, there are no final project submissions for me to review and I need to complete this course for work. I am stuck at 90% complete and I can't find where to contact someone about this issue. ",0,0,Mckenna Liski,87539084
