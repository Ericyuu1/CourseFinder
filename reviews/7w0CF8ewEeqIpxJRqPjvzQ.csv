28842552~COURSE!~7w0CF8ewEeqIpxJRqPjvzQ,1661405756327,3,0,"I am taking this course along with two others in the specialization. The courses themselves are actually quite well done and informative. 

However, I have a huge issue with how these courses are structured. Specifically with the requirements for completion. Students are required to rely on other students in order to complete. Each course ends with a peer-reviewed assignment, meaning another student grades your work. That alone is dubious, but the real issue is having to wait for some random to get around to reviewing your work before you get any credit for completing. It doesn't matter that you did all the work and turned it in on time. I actually want to the certificates for these courses, and I resent having to rely on other students, most of whom are unreliable. I've been reviewing assignments that were submitted two years ago. That's not a good sign.  Please change this. ",0,2,Taylor Jacobson,28842552

It takes an extensive approach and gives you a very good view of different ""global practices/ideas"" involving animals.Video quality can however be improved. Maybe consider including a few images during presentation. ",0,0,MWENDWA NKATHA MBAE,108462163
