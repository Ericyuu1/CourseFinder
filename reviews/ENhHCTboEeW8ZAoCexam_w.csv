I reluctantly write low gradings but this course has been a disencouraging experience, in coparation with what I was used to in this or other platforms. Last coments from moderators are many years old. The content is also not curated and some informations are no longer valid. The platforms offered are not working completely either (SAS). The content is not bad, though sometimes not so clear. It could be a fair or even a good course but the drawbacks have a big weight. Maybe it is not so bad as I now see it but the peer reviewing process is not managed either: I do not know if it is Coursera's fault, the Wesleyan University's or even ours -the students'- becuase very old or obsolete or not valid assignments are always around preventing current students to be able to grade current peers and respectively preventing us current students from getting graded.

However, the python coding could be more optimized; for example, it suggests doing the Chi Square post-hoc test for each variable one by one... which can be 15 batches of dictionary recodes! Thankfully someone in the forum provided a solution for doing an automated batch testing. Maybe the course lecturers felt that a batch recode would be too complicated, but it doesn't feel like you could use their method effectively for a work environment, either.
