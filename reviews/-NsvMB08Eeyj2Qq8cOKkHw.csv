The lab is a bit too simple in my view, as well, when it comes to installation of new tools and Shell commands,  It makes more sense to try it on my own laptop rather than in the lab environment.Will continue with the next course of the specialization.",0,1,Angel Yang,13202476

I would highly recommend that you take some other introductory Python course (there are many available online) before attempting this course to get the most value out of your time and effort.
