4201~COURSE!~r32oHRuLEeWxXBLj8jbgsw,1510839061908,2,0," I started loving Coursera since ""Machine learning"" by Andrew Ng and what amazed me most was his ability to explain complex mathematical concepts in really simple words, with clean, readable hand-drawn diagrams and drawings. I'm really missing this in the Cryptography course.  This course is quite difficult to understand and follow. Even if you have background in probability, the lectures explain a little of the underlying concepts and most of the lecture is essentially reading formulas and definitions from the slides. Even the presentation is unreadable - the formulas on slides aren't actual mathematical formulas but formula-like text typed in PowerPoint without any mathematical symbols or typography (lower or upper indexes, fractions etc). For example, the Bayes law is presented in the course as rather cryptic string ""Pr[A|B]=Pr[B|A]*Pr[A]/Pr[B]"" and here's its original, clean and readable formula for comparison https://goo.gl/P8Cvu2 This  gets even worse when it's being substituted into a multi-line equations, which - guess what - are simple PowerPoint text either.

The treatment is not superficial.This is where I dropped one star from the review - I thought that the course could have done a better job of covering the theory in this space, or at least pointing to sources to study it, or mentioning it as a pre-requisite.I also thought that the course could have done a better job of describing how all the pieces come together - the discussion is there, but it is light and somewhat assumed you will get it.
