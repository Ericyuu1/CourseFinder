The sound of the video was rather bad, at times illegible. Instructor's English accent was difficult to understand at times which made following the videos a bit tedious.  Also, there was a mistake in one of the solutions in video 4 where the following search was presented: SELECT Patient_Name, Disease, Doctor_NameFROM Patient, DoctorWHERE Patient.Patient_ID = Doctor.Doctor_IDThe last WHERE condition returned incorrect information and the correct clause should have been:WHERE  Patient.Doctor_ID = Doctor.Doctor_IDI am also puzzled as to why the instructor didn't use an INNER JOIN query instead. In fact, I expected INNER and OUTER JOINS to practice with as these are very effective but difficult to grasp  when retrieving data from relational databases.
