50796036~COURSE!~GBSdepgVEemFZQpjgGktLA,1587573618781,5,0,One of the best online courses I've seen - especially liked the way that peer review and discussion facilitates wider perspectives from students across the globe with their own experience of refugees and migration. Having peers who are reading alongside you and who supplement the lectures with their own reflections and insights from research and life experience was helpful. I'd highly recommend this course.,0,1,Mark Coffey,50796036
