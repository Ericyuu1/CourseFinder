It was as if they were trying to make the questions as hard as possible so they could trick the test taker instead of assessing the test takers actual knowledge. Also, the same question and answer was marked correct on one test and then incorrect on a subsequent test. The videos were presented in a very elementary way with weird cartoon drawings and no real power point slides or notes and all of the presenters were very unprofessional in their appearance.

Insight providing questions may involve finding the value of a parameter such as the epidemic can't spread, for instance.For more formula oriented optional exercises, I would recommend something similar to Differential Equations in Action from Udacity.
