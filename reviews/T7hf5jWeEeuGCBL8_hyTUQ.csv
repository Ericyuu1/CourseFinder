Thank you for this! However, I cannot understand, why after completing the course a part of studying materials are not accessible, even though I paid a sufficient price for the course. These unaccessible materials include Python programs which were used as a practice. Frankly, I find it unfair, since this practice would be extremely important to revise the materials while improving my skills in Machine Learning in the future. Moreover, a part of the montly fee was paid also for the practice materials. I may agree that these Python programs can be private, however,there should be ways to overcome this issue. Without the possibility to revise the code it will be much harder to create our own applications and programs. ",0,2,Mikhail Bandurist,29008626

Personally, I would like to see more time devoted to the Scikit-Learn implementation (and maybe Pandas data frames instead of NumPy arrays for the training data) as opposed to hard-coding the algorithms and using really small data sets. Scaling upwards and using those libraries on larger data sets should be relatively easy after you nail the foundational concepts in this course, though. There is definitely something to be said about knowing the mathematical algorithms running in the background of these black box models, and this course does a really good job of explaining them (namely, cost functions and gradient descent).Apart from scripting these algorithms in Python code, the course is somewhat lacking when it comes to conceptually explaining regression and classification models. For example, there is no time spent explaining how to interpret regression model coefficients and intercepts, and there is little time spent explaining the probabilistic interpretation of the sigmoid function and the importance of choosing a good decision boundary. It is one thing to know how to program these models and another thing to be able to explain them to people without a technical background, which I think could be a good lesson in future versions of the course.Overall, great introduction to the models and their implementation in Python!

As someone who started this course when it was free, I can say that previous version offered much more insights and tougher assignments and harder quiz questions, it was harder overall. This version feels kinda dumbed down a bit.2. Some (important?) things are left unrevealed,  not enough attention is paid to the issue of feature selection  and feature engineering (maybe some of it will be covered to extent in other specialization courses). That last assignment that included regularization in logistic regression had already given function which mapped 2d features into 27 dimensions, and someone without much math background could not really see how to map such cases by themselves. Maybe that stuff is out of scope of this course, but whole model fails if someone doesn't know how to do that input preprocessing and knowledge about algorithm then becomes irrelevant.That being said, whole course was amazing and interactive, with really valuable content, especially for a beginner. 4.5/5 from me",0,0,Dusan Stojkovic,6227413

A couple feedback points:- More questions throughout the videos might be helpful.
- I'm not sure the labs should be designated optional, since the final labs expect you to write some code. - It would be nice if there was more coverage on how to do feature engineering (ie. how do you know when to map original features to higher dimensions and orders?

Andrew Ng has a great teaching persona, and it's a real pleasure to watch the videos, even aside from what I'm learning, just because the vibe is so cheerful and supportive. As an educator and teacher trainer, I can be quite critical of how courses are taught, but this one is just a joy.

The content convered in the course allows the student to get an intuitive idea behind machine learning and gives him an idea of the mathematics behind it. The course is not very math intensive, but there is just enough math covered here to give the student an intuitive idea of machine learning.The coding labs provide very detailed code, which the user can learn and analyze to make his own machine learning algorithmMy favorite part about this course was how neatly the jupyter notebooks and python files of the lab were arranged and provided. These lab files take the burden of coding from scratch away from the students, and allow students to focus only on the algorithms behind machine learning.After this course, machine learning codes will no longer be a black box, but will be something you will understand very well. So, after doing this course, the next time you use Machine learning libraries like SciKitLearn, you will know exactly what is going on behind the curtains, can you can adjust parameters of ready-built ML funcitons to fit your needs.At the end of this course, you will learn how you can modify machine learning codes for each custom need, and you will gain the ability to do those modifications yourself.

For what it aims to achieve, I think it does a great job. /tldrT​he mathematics involved in the first course of this specialisation is not that difficult if you already have a solid foundation on calculus. S​ome functions used in the Optional Labs are called for you from already written python scripts (which you have access to, and can download to inspect). The first 3 weeks (and probably the rest of the course) will not teach you fundamentals on Python or mathematics or statistics, and some details regarding the choice of loss function for logistic regression were omitted. Furthermore, libraries such as scikit-learn were used to complement the material, but not explained in depth. (Granted, this course is not about Python libraries.)A​ll in all this seems like a great introduction to ML for people already comfortable with mathematics and Python.
