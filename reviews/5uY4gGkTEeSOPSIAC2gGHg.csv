While some of the readings were interesting, I found that the videos were so redundant and hard to follow. Also, half of the links for reading assignments do not work or require a subscription (i.e. The Economist). Why don't you post PDFs like most other classes require? This course is not worthy of money.",0,0,Lauren Anderson,39321432

3586639~COURSE!~5uY4gGkTEeSOPSIAC2gGHg,1459895471071,5,0,"This was a fascinating course on how to revive a failing business area by use of government financing of primarily tech start-ups.  It was a place in the country that is very different than Silicon Valley.  The knowledge to finance a new startup was very limited and had to be set up in government funded groups that could mentor all the new businesses.  There was a quick tour to other countries such as Greece which showed that even the EU had set up a Fund for Greek startups.  The one they were working on was a company that was trying to produce an app.  They did say that due to the lack of tech knowledge in their country the EU Fund was still full of money and could fund other startups.  The main course went back to Cleveland, where most of the effort was made to use a government approach.  They set up their own foundations, extended loans, made contacts with Venture Capitalists that participated in Silicon Valley and in this new type of gov approach.  After 10 years of working with this, they had some very good companies with great ideas.  The only drawback was that they didn't employ enough people to revitalize the entire area of Cleveland.  They were just beginning to do something that used the actual resources of the area.  There was a well known Cleveland Medical Center and some of the Professors there had done research which was new.  For some reason, again the lack of business resources, they had never created any companies from what they knew.  They did begin to create companies from the medical researchers in the area.  The main one had to do with maintaining cardiac health.  And",0,0,Theresa Daly,3586639
