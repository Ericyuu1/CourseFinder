48883184~COURSE!~Rm-00NO0Eei47RIrue0xzg,1641745612870,2,0,"The course is very small. Half of it presents Crowdfunding, and most part of it refers to peer-to-peer lending. A technique that is rarely used in start-ups, but rather mostly on personal level. The first part of it is nice, but the last of it is completely irrelevant as it refers to credit (card) scores, which are applied mainily to customers on a personal level and mature businesses that handle hundreds of millions and want to take out a bank loan.

72358322~COURSE!~Rm-00NO0Eei47RIrue0xzg,1621608109353,2,0,"Five Stars for subject matter; 1 star for execution.  tl;dr: In hindsight, I would have skipped this class. There are too many short comings to go through so I'll focus on the deal killer from my perspective.  The course quizzes are set up so that you get 1 try per 24 hours.  A big component of the convertible security quizzes are based off an excel model that you will have to build out/replicate on your own.  Even if you reverse engineer and back test your excel model to confirm the output of the various scenarios highlighted in the lecture slides, there is no guarantee that your model will give the correct answer on the quiz.  And there is no effective mechanic for reconciliation. This negative learning experience is compounded by the lack of moderator support in the discussion boards.  So for me, the worth of this class - high level conceptual overview of how convertible securities work in a VC setting - was more than outweighed by the negatives of reverse engineering the course's slide deck.   And you can get the former by reading through relevant wiki type links while skipping the grind of the latter. Part of me wants to say that the reverse engineering was worth it but the truth is, you only go through scenarios with three security types where, in contrast, most real life modeling has more security types and features and thus exponentially more complex modeling requirements.
