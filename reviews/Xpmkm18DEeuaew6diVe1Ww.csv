20348047~COURSE!~Xpmkm18DEeuaew6diVe1Ww,1641593536665,1,0,"This course is Beginner level, however, it was advertised as 'Advanced' level. If you are at Beginner level, then it is a worthwhile course for you as it is very simple. If you are Intermediate, it might be an okay refresher, but you definitely won't learn anything. Intermediate level SQL courses on Coursera are far more advanced than this, so it has been significantly misclassified and is not worth the money for anyone other than a beginner. Coursera needs to fix this issue, particularly as refunds are no longer permitted.",0,0,A Williams,20348047

The instructor was a bit hard to understand at times and the test had trick questions in there that made me miss the wording and have to retry. Otherwise, it'd be 5-stars.",0,0,Dalton Evans,103796915
