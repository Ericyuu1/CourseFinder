The videos are pretty dull, to the point were I found it a struggle to force myself through them. The content itself is also dubious and I wouldn't rely on it for information regarding Gamification. I also find it worrying that the lecturer constantly talks about the amazing benefits of Gamification in work, education and a whole tirade of social situations but cant seem to use it in their own course, which feels quite frustrating to work through. The quizzes are also badly made and worded. If you require a learner to choose one option then only give them one option, using multiple tick boxes is confusing and unhelpful... not challenging.I've seen Kevin talk on a number of subjects from Blockchain, Bitcoin and Business Ethics, and he is incredibly knowledgeable and informative, but this is a big let down.

The first two sections re-hash the same points over and over ""What is gamification? What is gamification not? for 30+ minutes and then section 2: ""What is gamification? What is gamification not?"" The course was, from the looks of it, filmed in 2008 and not update one bit since then, and therefore has a ton of outdated information, statistics, etc. They're always talking about things being ""new and emerging"" when, by now, they're from a prior decade. Gag me with a spoon. Why would I or anyone else pay $95 just to see the rest of this course when the first section or two of it is utterly incompetent except for referencing a few factoids about the concept of a game from ancient philosophers which anyone could Google to grasp the same concept of.

ago and went unchanged since then. The professor mentions examples dating of
2011 for instance and some links were unfortunately not accurate anymore or referring
to broken pages (even more important when the link is in the final exam!). This
makes the participant’s feelings that the course isn’t really maintained or
updated. I would say this is particularly troubling for such a class because even
though the basic concepts won’t change, I expect this field of research to
advance significantly year over year. We know how fast the digital world is
moving and it is the same with games. Mobile games are expanding, MMO games are
more and more present and new games designs are appearing. Hence these new
developments have to have impacts on the gamification elements. We could think
of games structures, designs, elements, etc.  I am sure the professor will agrees with me. This being said, the course was overall good. Content is satisfying
with lots of concepts, examples to explain them and real life application. The
professor did a great job in making the lectures interesting and easy to
follow. Written assignments were a good way to make sure we understand and immediately
apply the concepts of the lecture. I liked it. Thank you for providing

What makes the course good is the instructor speaks well, content is well organized, and the course is complete in the sense that you could take the course and then go start designing/creating gamified systems for real situations. Also, the instructor is great at creating enthusiasm in the learner about the content. Lastly, it is great to see that the instructor is approaching teaching the course as a gamer himself, and thus truly understands the impact of what he is teaching on more than an intellectuallevel.
Course is good, but old. On the topic of old, the course content needs a major update as it has been six years since first release, some of the examples no longer exist, and there are many examples that are just not relevant to the people taking the course today.
The course lacks the resources you might expect. For example, a download of annotated slides associated with each lecture, and most important missing resource is a 1-page document summarizing the whole gamification framework. The first part of the framework is presented as a triangle on day 2, and the second part is presented as a list of 6 points to consider on day 4. I am not criticizing the presentation order, you know the content better than I and best way to present. But, my feedback is the difficulty to digest the framework when presented in a fragmented way. Without a reference back to a single page document that we could see what part of the framework are we exploring now made it difficult to understand the big picture at all times. In general, it would help to take a look at other courses created in the last 3 years, granted there could be limitations with Coursera and the types of content it can offer that I am not aware of.",0,1,Adam Haesler,100806568

16140604~COURSE!~69Bku0KoEeWZtA4u62x6lQ,1451033762749,5,0,这是我第一个MOOC的证书，超开心！  以下是我这六周以来学这门课的感受，希望对大家有帮助啦  其实很早之前就听说过mooc了，因为在我们学校大二的物理课有一部分成就是要上mooc上做这门课的题目才能拿到的。但是那时候并没有对其他的课程有太大兴趣。一直到现在大四稍微有点自己的时间就开始到处找东西学，就找来这了。  学这门课的初衷是因为我本身就是个忠实的游戏玩家（这门课的第一个镜头是WOW更是深得我心），而且我当时正在因为自己平时学习效率不高，没有办法很好的执行自己订下的计划，希望能自己设计一个比较游戏一点的方式来激励自己，所以就入了这门课。  总得来说，为期六周的这门课内容还是挺多的，比较系统的讲了游戏化的概念，产生及流行的原因，作用的内在机制，一些具体的设计步骤和方法，还有和游戏化密切相关的一些法律和伦理问题，虽然因为课时比较短，一些内容没能说得很深入很透彻，但是大体还是把整个游戏化系统都讲全了。  给我留下深刻印象的有这么几点： 1.老师很萌很幽默，经常一个人对着镜头傻笑个不停哈哈哈哈哈 2.每一次上课，每一个方面的内容，老师都会举出非常多的例子来辅助说明，其中不乏像可口可乐，TOYOTA，麦当劳等知名企业的游戏化案例，而且在说不同的课程内容时，老师会反复提出之前的例子，从不同角度来剖析这个案例。深刻而全面。 3.每一周老师都会邀请一个人做interview，有大学同事，有同样是游戏化领域的专家，也有在自己企业中成功运用游戏化的CEO，在课堂上现身说法，这些贴近生活的案例简直就是宝贵的教材，反观现在国内大部分教育，不是对着黑板就是对着课本，口可口可 4.这个课程的作业既有quiz，也有assignment，就是小作文。quiz的多选题比较难，错一个选项就全错，所以做作业的时候一定要谨慎再谨慎！小作文的话一开始上手会有些困难，毕竟有英语写嘛，建议大家不要太过于纠结语法啊时态啊这些东西，能够表达清楚自己的意思就行，反正如果你的英语水平一般，再怎么改还是会被那些英语母语的同学在互评的时候看穿，倒不如把时间和精力多放在怎么用文章的结构和关键词把自己的意思表达好。我认为这个才是最重要的。 5.推荐大家还是做做笔记，特别是老师PPT上的说明内容，很多都会考到，当然，能理解，变成自己的东西就最好啦。 ,0,2,Zhichao Zhang,16140604
