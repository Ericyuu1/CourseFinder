I took it on a whim (I thought it would be about Australia) It forced me to consider the impact of Residantial (Boarding) schools on myself, and its relevance to my own culture - let alone the culture of peoples, that people from this side of the water ended up treating so appallingly.  This set of a whole journey of recovery - a POWERFUL response to the emotional impact of facing up to this aspect of our shared history.  It was important to me to revisit the course - sadly my comments from previously have gone.. as there were a lot and it really stirred me up.  In a good way.  The awareness that we are all in this together is very much alive in me even more than then, but I think its been a process of also feeling that responses like actually studying are much more productive than guilt or shame or horror at what human beings can get up to - particularly when they immerse themselves in a narrow world view, that places themselves at the top, and everyone else as a lesser being.
