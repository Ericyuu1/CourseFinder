79543728~COURSE!~kahsBRtIEemZRAqH7m9oGA,1624053081930,3,0,"Good course with well presented information and good info on topics related to multi-threaded processing vulnerabilities, environment variables, file systems, cryptography, public/private key sharing, input injection, buffer overflows, validation, and permissions (all dealt with via a Linux backdrop).

That said, the coding examples were usually small and not particularly practical. This course would be greatly improved with better examples and deep dives into various scenarios for each topic. Additionally implementation of  jupyter notebooks for c/c++ build environments would be excellent for showcasing how to run/write secure code and also take advantage of insecure code.",0,0,Nickolas Davis,79543728
