I hope more Primary Care Physicians (PCP) will take this course as a cancer survivor physician myself, I under stand the patients need for more effective communication across specialties and especially with their PCP who can help coordinate the patients care through the maze and for decades after providing needed patient support (believe me that is so lacking especially amongst the specialists treating the patients). Thank you for having the insight to think about this need and going further to develop this course! God Bless as we all work to encourage and support our patients at the primary care level.
