786510~COURSE!~CTlGQf2KEeSToSIACxsEgg,1497850307867,1,0,I am unable to complete this course as I did not receive enough peer reviews on the final assignment. I know I was the first student to submit this assignment as there were no others to peer review. When they became available I reviewed more than required as it was apparent student enrolments were low. Coursera's only response to what is a chronic problem is pathetic. It says you should enrol again and hope that in a few years you might be able to complete a unit. It should instead require the institution which offers a course to ensure its tutors clear any backlog (which would not be time consuming as the issue is caused by low enrolments).,0,5,Richard Lancaster,786510

4008450~COURSE!~CTlGQf2KEeSToSIACxsEgg,1443974583842,3,0,An interesting course even if you don't complete the assignments because you can expect to get around an 80% even if you fully grasp the subject matter due to the peer review requirement.
