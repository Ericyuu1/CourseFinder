46420591~COURSE!~Cao98AVvEeeqVhLFdsSxXA,1581398444901,3,0,"Overall the design of the module is very
nice, and they are stacked in an organized way. The way they are taught are
also very helpful and easy to understand.However here are some key issues:I) Some of the press articles / white papers
are quite dated – as old as 2012. Naturally, some of them have lost their
relevance in today’s time (more so when we are discussing about digital
disruption in Financial Services sector). These materials should get replaced
with more relevant content.II) The YouTube video tutorials on Applepay
does not work anymore (a message pops up – This
video is private)III) All three links on the implications (implications
for banks, customers and society) of Open Banking do not work, and there are
questions on the assessment section on this implication part. It’s difficult to
answer a question without going through the materials offered.IV) Certain questions on the assessment
sections are carrying grammatical mistakes (eg. for the final assessment module
of Week 2 - Money Makes the World go Around, Q3, Q11 are wrongly framed).
Though one can understand the questions, however wrong English is not desirable
from an Institution offering EducationV) The framework on few of the questions are
difficult to understand. There is a question on Core Banking Activities, I
could not figure out the right answer. But I believe I have fair knowledge on
what is Core Banking. I could not find out a way on how I can get the answer
that is right according to Coursera. So once candidates completes their assessment,
there should be a way to know the correct answer in case someone is unable to answer
the right. I am not sure if there is a way to find out the right answer post
completion of assessment.VI) There are few questions who have lost the
present day context. An example – there is a question on whether present day
banks are equipped to offer a gamut of digital solutions to its customers with
the option to choose from Yes or No. In present day context, it cannot be said
that today’s banks are completely ill-equipped to offer such services, as a lot
of banks / financial institutions have made significant developments in digital
offerings (payments, eKYC, mobile apps etc.). Hence for such questions, there
should be relevance with present day context. I hope Coursera will look into this.",0,0,Sourabh Biswas,46420591
