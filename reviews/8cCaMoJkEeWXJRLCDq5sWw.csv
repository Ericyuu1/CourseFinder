However, when the lectures are in English, which is not the instructor's native tongue, the result can be a halting delivery. While this does not impact the video so much, I find the transcripts can be difficult. When the instructor pauses to order his thoughts and words, the transcript all too often shows a period, creating a disjointed narrative; among other things, there are words misunderstood (""designer's"" for ""the Zionists""); the dreaded apostrophe (""it's"" for ""its""); words missing (so guesswork is required to maintain continuity), when a little more effort may fill the gap.

a very hot topic of discussions these days, but sadly a lot of people don’t know
much about the region. Most of the people learn about the Middle East trough media.
Popular (mainstream) media creates an image of the region that only involves
terrorism, autocratic governments and civil war. Even though most of the Middle
East contemporary problems are extremely complicated, this course will help you
understand a little about the region’s modern history, culture and
ethnic/religious diversity. Understanding Middle East’s history (especially its
modern history) will help you a great deal to understand the region’s
contemporary issues.  The Middle East is
much more than what we see in the news. This course will greatly expand your knowledge
