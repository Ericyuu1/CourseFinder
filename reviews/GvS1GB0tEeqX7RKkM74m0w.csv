If you intend to understand how finite element analysis works, this is not for you.Also, I think they could have done a better job explaining the different types of constraits. This topic is barely touched, and i think the right constraints are crucial to a good simulation study.Lastly, fusion 360 is NOT a tool to make deep and complex simulations.
