103888659~COURSE!~OgfxoAUPEeyUUwrGCdW75Q,1653481783078,5,0,"I enjoyed and got a lot out of these courses (series of three). The instructer is very knowledgable, however, the lack of feedback is not helpful to any student. If an instructor is going to give a faling grade on an assignment, they should say why. It is not useful to fail a student with no explanation. It is for this reason, that I am unable to finish this course, and I am reluctant to take another course on-line. ",0,0,Marie Bossi,103888659
