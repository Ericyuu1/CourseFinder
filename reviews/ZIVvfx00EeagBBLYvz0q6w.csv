Many mistakes in the slides and codes, and you needed to find the solutions in the discussions.

Where Dr. Chuck's series is well-taught in-depth information with great examples and explanations, this course series is basically a summary and the instruction to go out and learn everything yourself from the web.  That's an abysmal way to teach, because for beginners to data science programming, there is no basis to determine which is bad or good information you pick up from a blog or Youtube.  This class is a perfect example of just that, but worse, because there's an implicit trust in a professor from a university the caliber of Michigan.The lessons are old, and they won't update them.  The forums are full of bug reports and information about code that works when tested outside the class environment, because the class is taught on networkx version 1.11, which was released in 2016.  I'm writing this in April of 2020, and networkx 2 was released almost 4 years ago, and this class is teaching techniques that no longer work because the code is deprecated.  In every course in this series, I wasted long hours trying to debug what I was doing wrong in my assignments, only to find out that my code was perfect - today, and the grader was testing my work with functions that are no longer valid.I know reviews can be biased, especially negative reviews, so please read the forums before enrolling in this course and wasting your money.  The quality of education from this series is very poor, and you are better suited to learning from Youtube (sadly) if you want actual information you can use in your work.Unless you are looking for an education so that you can go back in time and find a job in 2015, this course is a waste of time and money.",0,20,Mark Greene,5954059

So, what is the problem? The problem is that the course is not called ""Applied Graph Analysis in Python"" but ""Applied Social Network Analysis in Python"". This incongruity in the title of the course (intentional or not) will generate erroneous expectations in the students, especially if we consider that they have to take the course to finish the specialization. Regarding the assignments, they are divided into two groups: trivial tasks that are solved with a single line of code extracted from the NetworkX manual and more complex tasks related to Machine Learning that do not involve putting into practice the concepts of this course but those of the third course of the specialization.

There are several reasons why I'm rating this course 2 out of 5 stars: 1) The content of the first three weeks were just informational and should have been covered in one or two weeks.2) Homework assignments were not challenging at all. 90% of the questions were one-liners and required simply calling the methods of networkx that was discussed. This course would benefit by homework assignments that had 1-2 problems that required us to solve real-life problems from scratch, rather than ONLY calling networkx methods. 3) There was no discussion on how to get network data. We were just given all this magical data about how relationship scores between employees and future connections between employees... How am I supposed to get that in real life?? Some problems asking us to make a network would've been valuable. 4) More time should have been spent on prediction and other advanced topics, at least another week to bring the ""Applied"" into ""Applied Social Network Analysis.""5) I really enjoyed the professor's teaching style.

I can envision using what I learned in my job.  However, of the five courses in the Applied Data Science with Python Specialization I felt this was the weakest offering.  1. The Title.  While the majority of the examples and exercises were focused on social networks, there's little in the course that is really specific to social networks.  The course applies to any kind of network that can be loaded into networkx.2. Trim the Process Descriptions.  Too often the lecturer would say things like ""Node A has degree of 3 because it is connected to three other nodes.  Node B has a degree of 5 because it is connected to five other nodes.  Node C has a degree of 4 because it is connected to four other nodes."" For such a simple concept, that many examples aren't needed.3. Provide On-Screen Example Files (my biggest gripe).

However, there were several issues with the AutoGrader that did not get fixed until late in the course and the PowerPoint slides for the lectures were also very late in getting posted (they were not available for most of the programming assignments).  So, I think this course was launched a little early.  Still, these are problems that you might expect to see the first time a course is taught and should not affect future students.  The bigger complaint I have on the course was that it was a very gentle introduction of the topic with only a quick overview of the subject.  The lectures themselves concentrated more on a litany of various measures and metrics to characterize networks and could have benefited from a broader examination of real networks in the real world.  One of the most interesting topics was a very quick overview of plotting for network diagrams, but this was never followed up with a programming assignment or other aspects to give us practice using the techniques described.  This course would benefit from 2-4 additional weeks of material and more programming assignments, IMO.  The network graphing lecture, for example, could have been reinforced with a peer-graded assignment to have us produce 3 or 4 types of graphs of various networks.Overall, though, I was pleased with this course and the entire specialization.   I would definitely recommend it to others.",0,0,David Calloway,6882122

Anyway, this course in my opinion is the best course in the specialisation and I'm glad I stuck around for it.  Pros: the instructor has a very good delivery, and explains concepts in sufficient depth gradually, I really like the way he explained how some measures are calculate using step-by-step examples showing which nodes/edges are being used. Compared to Professor Brooks who either gives very superficial lectures on what matplotlib can do (line graphs) to suddenly going into the technical details of the different matplotlib layersThe assignments are the most reasonable I've seen in this specialisation, tying relatively well with the course lectures (though Week 3 assignment's might be tad too simplistic).  Con: Outdated autograder as usual, however this was probably the mildest case compared to Course 1 (Intro to Data Science) where so many things were different between the old and new pandas version.Here's my personal overall ranking of each course in this specialisation from best to worse:1. Social Network Analysis2. Applied Machine Learning3. Applied Text Mining4. Intro to Data Science5. Plotting ",0,0,Jun-Hoe Lee,2410295

It is a big plus that the final assignment is really pulling together your knowledge from most courses in this specialization (there is no visualization required in the final assignment).My only complaint is that the course seems like somewhat of an afterthought to bring the course count to 5 in the specialization. The content in week 4 is particularly short. I would rate this course 4 stars on its own, but given how it lines up in the specialization it is an easy 5-star.",0,0,Tamas Barko,47247774
