The only comment I would make is that in the last section (alert boxes), the instructor did not indicate where the console log would appear, and indeed I hunted high and low for it myself (still a bit of a mystery, despite every other log under the sun being visible). I think he could also have demonstrated asserting the alert text, and also expended this section to cover the second two alerts on the web page, which were not used in the exercise.",0,0,COWARD ROBERT ANTONY,84125229
