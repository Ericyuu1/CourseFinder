44675169~COURSE!~73Lxu-fmEeWQlQrpKdAFaw,1598447025393,2,0,"Overly stretched out. Not much new stuff to learn in it. Also, a bit biased towards Brits in the beginning. Enjoyed the frankness of discussion towards the end about the dark side of Magna Carta and the acceptance of the fabrication of its legacy. Could have been a 2 weeks course.

101752234~COURSE!~73Lxu-fmEeWQlQrpKdAFaw,1651389100328,4,0,"V​ery informative. Especially Week 6 regarding economic freedom. I wish to see the sequal to take up issues faced by people with mental illnesses, disability, and those deprived of educational opportunities who are often left out of this type of intellectual discussion about right assertion based on the concept of Magna Carta, and how they can achieve the skills to do so.

5457606~COURSE!~73Lxu-fmEeWQlQrpKdAFaw,1600351989384,4,0,"I thought that this was a very interesting class. As an American, Magna Carta is something that is really only taught in World History classes, it is not a basic topic of study for all students. It really should be, and I am glad that I was able to really learn about it in such depth.",0,0,Angela Ryan,5457606
60269587~COURSE!~73Lxu-fmEeWQlQrpKdAFaw,1595365045495,4,0,One should definitely join this course if he is interested in knowing the first brick of democracy and statutes.

45992125~COURSE!~73Lxu-fmEeWQlQrpKdAFaw,1591819999027,4,0,"A very interesting course. I personally would have preferred a course more focused on the original Magna Carta, the problems that led up to it and the study of the main antagonists. Nevertheless, I understand that at the dawn of its 800th anniversary, it was more important to stress Magna Carta's impact over time and effectively, the study lessons proved that there was more to this document than meets the eye.",0,1,Claude Schomer,45992125

85647364~COURSE!~73Lxu-fmEeWQlQrpKdAFaw,1627164493789,5,0,"A​ Masterpiece of an Introduction to Law, Constitution formation and Implementation and early Political Systems, including the Monarchy. This Course should be mandatory in all English-Speaking Schools, especially the 220 former Colonies of the British Empire, the second largest the world has experienced. Putting it in other languages will spread the knowledge. The saying that you do not know where you are going until you fully understand where you were, is apt fully here. Unbelievable sharing of data, so essential towards Lifelong Learning. The Videos were excellent visits to other places, which may never be seen in a lifetime of many. The Physical Infrastructure, Lecturers and content were wonderful examples for a Student of Architecture, Law, Social and Community Psychology, Political Science and Parenting. London University should consider packaging all relevant Law Courses in conjunction with Coursers Inc. into a format to greatly increase the Legal Empowerment and Legal Capability of so many of the 4 Billion people worldwide without Access to Justice. They already have the Content, Lecturers, Physical Infrastructure and Historical Experience to lead the way. My Sincere thanks for your Sharing.",0,0,Donald Berment,85647364

54383743~COURSE!~73Lxu-fmEeWQlQrpKdAFaw,1601384461112,5,0,"As an Indian citizen, I think the traditions of Magna Carta definitely reflect in the constitution of India as well, and obviously I am bound to, some extent, look at the traditions in a critical perspective. But overall the course has really achieved what it set out to do, that is that it really made the history of Magna Carta in UK and the lands which would eventually become the commonwealth clear. Though I think the creators of this course have avoided having the hard conversations on the dark aspects of the British Empire by just focusing on the impact of the Magna Carta on the American Constitution, and avoiding the conversations from former South East Asian and African colonies ",0,1,Kabir Madan,54383743
