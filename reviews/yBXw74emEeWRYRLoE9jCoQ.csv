22579970~COURSE!~yBXw74emEeWRYRLoE9jCoQ,1624905546043,1,0,"I​t looked promising, but the written assignments are confusing. I submitted two, but am uncertain I completed them correctly. Also, I wrote them in Microsoft Word and copied them into the Coursera document block, which obliterated the formatting so that the document was hard to read. I spent forever reformatting it. Now I have to wait for someone to grade them. Apparently, that may be a while because few people enroll in this course. And now that I'm halfway through (if someone grades my work), I cannot continue anyway. You must coach to complete the other assignments. But I'm not a coach yet. I'm learning how to be one. For me, this class was a dead end.",0,4,Carol S,22579970
21523918~COURSE!~yBXw74emEeWRYRLoE9jCoQ,1483434587983,1,0,"I am really sorry that a course with such a good content is ruined by the unrealistic assignement of week 4. That assignment will at least take 6 weeks to do and that should naturally lead to course length of 10 or 11 weeks which would be realistic. So if you pay money for it, start the course and do it till week 4, than pause and do the assignment and restart at a later date in order to comply to the necessary tasks. The creators of this course did not react to our cries of help within a week. Poor support from them - the coursera team tried to help but obviously in vain. What I learnt for future courses: I will look into the detail of every assingment before starting and paying. Unfortunately in some courses you can´t even look into the assignments when you haven´t paid. This should be changed. Because I consider it a trick to lure someone into an interesting course and then making it impossible to finish it in the given timeframe. Not being able to see what will be demanded prior to paying may also be a coursera policy problem. So maybe there is a better platform than coursera that lets you to be clear of what is ahead of you. For a learner this is of great value: honesty, transparency and realistic information - because I have to plan and schedule how much time I can take for learning! ",0,6,Fichtberger Oliver,21523918
14822404~COURSE!~yBXw74emEeWRYRLoE9jCoQ,1481553554344,1,0,"the course is designed in a way you can not accomplished or get certificate  on the proposed timeframe. It was very disappointing to pay for certification and not be able to get it due to issues with the course developers  ( a lack of understanding of how coursera works, it's clear they did not care to adapt to a  5 week course) and peer reviewed activities proposed that took over 6 weeks to get done. (further to the course timeframe) The assistance from developers was too poor and never sought to find solutions, which is very strange in a course for coaching. Not the mention video quality that is scary, I could not watch the videos, and preferred to study by reading the transcriptions. ",0,2,Isabela de Castro,14822404

I provided comments within the course feedback about these areas, and don't want to repeat them here.At some point along the way of creating on line course material it seems someone thought that side angles of the speakers was a good idea.  I would agree it's good, if the speaker then turns toward the new camera angle, but having the speaker still look at the original camera is simply distracting.  Take a look at a few thousand news clips if that would be helpful, and see if the speaker is ever filmed not looking into the camera.Last, this course was initially set up with an unannounced three-week, peer-review assignment at week four.  That has been corrected with a step-by-step, weekly peer review assignment.  It's a bit much on the peer reviews, but it's better.  I already commented that the expected and graded components of each weekly coaching assignment should be laid out for each week so the students know what they will be graded on . . . and that each week with a client may progress at a different rate than the expected review.
