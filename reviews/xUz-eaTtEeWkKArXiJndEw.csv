6908696~COURSE!~xUz-eaTtEeWkKArXiJndEw,1537444121163,1,0,"The Capstone was the worst content of the whole specialisation.Not to mention how horrible reviewed exercises because they require pre-made that 1] some students simply copy and 2] people take your points away even though you said the exact same thing, but simply with other words.",0,2,Romario Verbran,6908696
47833098~COURSE!~xUz-eaTtEeWkKArXiJndEw,1592123819993,2,0,"It is extremely difficult to rate this course. The final project is extremely interesting, both because it truly requires holistic approach and application of all the concepts from the previous courses, and also because Tesla is a company that can't be easily classified. However, the case study is from 2015 and hasn't been updated since. In the meantime, Tesla has managed to introduce the product the capstone is about, with various adjustments and variations; more, they have managed to introduce a completely new vehicle too! It is also disappointing, that grade rules are so strict. There are key words and concepts given for grading, which totally throws away any thinking outside of the box.

3883691~COURSE!~xUz-eaTtEeWkKArXiJndEw,1573435321709,4,0,This course is a good recap of the previous 4 courses in the specialization. Taking off one star only because some of the peer grading rubrics could be improved. I did run into the issue of peer reviewers taking off points because they were looking for specific keywords without looking for comprehension of the answers i.e. even if the answer was essentially the same using different words.,0,2,Jawahar Singh,3883691
