BUT biggest PROBLEM is there with peer review system. One has completed this course bit earlier, they have to wait till other peer do not review your submitted assignment. And that is NOT good. You have to WAIT AND WASTE your learning time till other person do not review your assignment. Other biggest problem you can NOT jump to any such course where this grade is important to complete.

I don't know who decided to do this (the organizers of this course or Coursera) but I don't think it was a good idea.I was not interested (and I am sure I am not the only one) in receiving a certificate. I just wanted to learn and to test the acquired knowledge. 
I realize that it is impossible to improve this project without any money, but you can obtain the needed money from other sources (donations, sponsorships) without affecting those who want to learn. Event that the access to the video was not restricted (thus, many knowledge can still be acquired by those who want), the assignments have their important role in the learning process.I saw that I am not the only one who mentioned in the feedbacks the purchasing problem for this course. I hope that these feedbacks will be taken into account and the things will be changed for the next editions of this course.

was supposed to be the last one before capstone and what did we learn:·        
Nothing
about electronic·

amount about networking on very basic level – question is what are people without
this knowledge at all doing in IoT course·

you can tweet from Raspberry Pi (hey, is somebody crazy here)·

of words about camera, few minutes about servo motor and that’s all.We have to
write a web server update which is completely unexplained and no one didn’t do
it because no one understood it that way (despite the fact that webserver is
webserver and server is server) and during whole course no one update the task
