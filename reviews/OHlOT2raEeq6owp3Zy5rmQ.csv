Course bounced around a lot from topic to topic without a clear summary of what was learned at the end.

1102716~COURSE!~OHlOT2raEeq6owp3Zy5rmQ,1605114713824,3,0,"Interesting subject, and very knowledgeable instructor, but the lectures felt like a lot of course materials distilled into walls of text and a lot of bullet points, with whole chapters just explained with a sentence or two. The ""reflection questions"" also felt like just repeating the bullet points. May be more reflective of me as a student than the course, but nevertheless. I would have preferred a smaller number of mental frameworks or acronyms to learn and more in-depth instead with real-life examples.  There was also an error with the final quiz. Questions 5 and 7 were identical, I gave the same answer but one was rated correct and one incorrect: Question 5
True or False - AI Solutions that involve an operational action paired with the outcome have greater clinical benefit thank those that have a medical action paired with the outcome

Answer: False.
Correct
Both can be very beneficial


Question 7
True or False - AI Solutions that involve an operational action paired with the outcome have greater clinical benefit thank those that have a medical action paired with the outcome

Answer: False.
Incorrect
Both can be very beneficial",0,3,Lars Westergren,1102716

The topics include Evaluation Frameworks, Deployment Methodologies, Regulatory considerations, key considerations of fairness and bias in AI Applications, and Ethical considerations in AI. In many ways, any organization that intends to or is in the process of developing AI Applications should take these topics into consideration even before development begins.
