112644246~COURSE!~y9cRQS5YEemZvxKL2M8ZqA,1669913282441,1,0,"Pros:
- Real life-like scenario for you to study by yourself and come to your own conclusions and analysis.Cons:
- Some knowledge of Python is required even tho this is a SQL specialization targeted at beginners with little-to-no prior programming knowledge of any kind. You shouldn't have to go to something like stackoverflow to troubleshoot things that weren't even discussed in this or prior courses since it more or less defeats the purpose of enrolling in guided courses like this one.
- 4 peer-graded assignments. In my opinion, this is the weakest link in all of Coursera. Especially when it comes to courses targeted at beginners. You really can't expect a beginner to rate some of these, more nuanced projects correctly/fairly simply by giving them a cheat sheet. That's without mentioning language barriers and peer availability (this course is the least enrolled of the specialization, btw), among other things.Overall, it's kinda disappointing to see a specialization that started so well end (for those lucky enough to get graded) up in such a mediocre fashion.

28034498~COURSE!~y9cRQS5YEemZvxKL2M8ZqA,1663007552108,2,0,"This is the worst specialization I have taken so far on Coursera, and I have taken several, either from universities or private companies. The first course is fine for someone who already has SQL knowledge and just needs a refresher, but it is still a course with zero depth in the use of SQL in data science. It is just slides, better explanations of SQL can be found on YouTube.The second course shows an interesting use of SQL, which is not normally covered. But the structure, assessments, assignments and final project are very open and ambiguous. The explanations are superfluous and you can tell that the course was made in a hurry, with no attention to details and with deficiencies in teaching.Perhaps the third course is the best, as they present a useful technology and platform.The final project is a total disappointment, as it is not focused on SQL and its use in Data Science activities, the videos are largely a recycling of those seen in previous courses, so that SQL, which is what the specialization is about, you do not learn something new or have the opportunity to apply it as it really applies in Data Science. Better SQL projects are found on YouTube, but these do not give a certificate endorsed by an educational institution such as the University of California, Davis. Sad that the readings in week four are links to other courses, they did not bother to create material or even reference it in a better way. Zero material is shared. After this experience I think I will not take any other course or specialization of this University, as well as not recommend it, I finished it just to receive the certificate, but I think it is not worth spending time on it.",0,3,Fabian Enrique Pedreros Camargo,28034498
94027270~COURSE!~y9cRQS5YEemZvxKL2M8ZqA,1652246326424,2,0,"This course was mainly a Python-course instead of an SQL-course - not only in terms of examples and screencasts, but also the exercises can not be sufficiently worked through with SQL solely. If no pyhton / R / scala and visualization skills are already there, it would take far to much time to learn it in such a small course. Additionally, the exercises did not point out all the nessecairy aspect to fulfill to get the full score clearly in all cases: When they say ""use 1 or 2 new metric"" they actually mean: ""Set up 2 metrics to get the full score"", which is odd, because one might instead focus on other aspect on the analysis, when following the first formulation.

Again (as in the 2nd course of the specialization) I did not find it fruitful to dive deep into a dummy dataset, that has nothing to do with our actual profession. Additionally, this is far from being presentable in a portfolio. I would suggest providing a specialization filled with the basics and techniques, leave the application up to the real use cases. This is not effectively teachable in a MOOC. 

Additionally, pointing out to paid courses from the same provider, as had been done in week 4, is not providing resources, it is advertising.

I also disliked the fact that all assignments were peer graded. That slowed down progression dramatically and I do not benefit from unqualified feedback from people who are no more capable or even less capable than I am. Also the reviews often where simply wrong.

If a course where skills from the previouse ones are being united - which btw. this course not really resembles of - is really needed - which I doubt - then I would suggest presenting more best practices and techniques of structuring data and a project and questioning these knowledge in quizzes.",0,4,Jannis ,94027270

But the execution is sloppy. I think the course need to be balanced between exploration and steering as well. It should be designed so that some insights was hidden in the data and with no particular instruction, the students should find out these insights. So they have meaningful goal that they reached as well as a handful of exploration experience from the lack of instruction.Instead? We have 3 sets of data, which are too narrow even compare to the example given in the lecture. Also the lecture and the assignments are barely comparable, which is more confusing. The peer review is cute and all but not too useful in this kind of capstone project where learners are generally inexperience.Overall, not too much value was added from the course unless you want to experience the frustration of working with data, which you can get elsewhere.

But through that I learned a hell of a lot, just stick to your ambition with answering your question and plug away at trying to get the answer even if it means googling lots to work lots of stuff out yourself. If you do, you may have a project worthy of being shared with your network or even blogged about.Some feedback: given this was part of a SQL specialization, it would've been interesting to ensure candidates created a database that they would query themselves, rather than just draw the ER diagram. But to be fair on Course 4, that wasn't taught in the courses before, just seems to me to be an opportunity missed?Another feedback: it may have been more helpful for the examples to be based in Spark / Pyspark for them to have the feel they build on Course 3 of this Specialization.
