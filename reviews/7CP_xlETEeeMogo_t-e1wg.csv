3612916~COURSE!~7CP_xlETEeeMogo_t-e1wg,1638205091040,4,0,"This is a very solid course but the ""peer grading"" requirement needs to be changed.  I finished the course on the first or second day of November and had to log on multiple times a day every day until now (Nov 29) to finally get my peer reviews done.  The course clearly does not have enough traffic to justify every student doing 3 peer reviews.  The requirement should be definitely be reduced - at least to 2 and possibly all the way to one.",0,0,Lincoln Anderson,3612916
