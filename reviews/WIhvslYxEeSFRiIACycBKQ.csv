The content of most lectures is generic stuff one can find on the Internet. I did not learn anything new. Since I'd paid for the certificate, I thought I'd finish it. I urge Prof. Joordens (and fellow Canadian citizen) to take some Critical Theory courses and review some of his damaging statements about: -Muslim women, -""black"" kids of Harlem,-Schizophrenic homeless people ""choosing to live in the streets and being unemployable because"" [....Who would hire them?] (fyi: I live in Vancouver, BC)-or the very poor presentation of the ""theory of attraction"". An age old unfunded theory presented as the sole work on the topic.If Psychology is a science, then this course is not about Psychology. It is merely a wikipedia level of content. I am disappointed, but more than that, worried that an influential Professor of Psychology is lacking awareness of his own biases and is spreading this around. Is there anyone ever checking the content of these courses or do we just give these Professors license to say what they want. Should we even care? I think we must.A final note, the performative awesomeness of Canada and Canadians is plain repulsive. If this course is meant to reach out to everyone on the globe, can we please refrain from these nationalist comments on MOOC materials. It's is tasteless. ",0,68,Hasnaa F.,954911

I learnt so much from the lecturer; this course has helped me get a basic understanding of a wide range of topics. The reason my review is a 4-star grading instead of 5 stars is mainly due to the peer-graded assignment. I understand that this is a feature of Coursera hence it may be beyond the control of the Professor. Nevertheless, my feedback is that peer graded assignment is certainly one of the least objective forms of assessment as the score is given by students of varying capability and language skills proficiency. For sure, it's easy for me to suggest that the Professor or the Mentor should step in to give the grades but I jolly well know it's a tall order considering the high student enrollment.  In conclusion, while I disagree with using peer-graded assignment as a form of assessment due to the unlimited biases involved, I would nonetheless continue to give thumbs up for this course. Considering the brewing mental health crisis exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, it's certainly critical that we have in our arsenal a better awareness of psychological skills.

But as Dr. pugh was reminding me that day, patients aren't always right.It seemed to the patient that her symptoms were a response to anxiety. At least two specialists confirmed the diagnosis, and he was treating for it. And yet to dr. Pugh, the story seemed atypical. Most patients with anxiety had experienced it their whole lives, or at least since adolescence. And the fact that she was taking two medicines for anxiety — one at a very high dose — and still felt anxious was also strange. M.D pugh wondered if this might be something other than the run-of-the-mill anxiety disorder.Hemal shah Experiencing Neck pain and left side head pain and head pain does come and go away for only 10 seconds to 15 seconds, so killer pain in the head lets him cry.

In a nutshell, he is AWESOME!What I did not like, which is also why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is mainly due to organisational matters: 1) the course schedule does not follow the weeks as listed in Coursera which creates TOTAL confusion, and it can be very easily solved. At the very least, the mid-term and final exams should be placed after the correct weekly schedule. Right now it is shifted by a week (earlier)2) The instructions about the peer assignments were not fully clear. I think also there, this is a quick fix and quick win. Simply adjusting the wording to better explain the process would help reduce questions on the forum. 3) There was almost no staff involvement in the forum. The responses were very far in between, which also made the forum discussions not as lively or exciting. I would have loved having the professor himself on the forum, or at least one of his assistants in the forum, sparking discussions, responding to threads etc. This was almost on existent.

Unfortunately, some of the videos are not available (obviously, not anyone's fault) and some links was wrongly linked to other sites. Sometimes the links in ppt are wrong, sometimes the links in the flatform go wrongly. I understand that 30 minutes are not enough to cover each topics, so I will prefer to have other courses which provide a deeper investigation in each topics (or some keys topics) . It will be greater if these courses were linked to each others or recommended to learned who completed one of them.

Second posting a DIPLOMA/CERTIFICATE photo as example - would answer many questions on forums, pls also post this in THE WEEK 1 - ORIENTATION. Third, problems in QUIZ, the first and last quiz are asking questions about info that are NOT COVERED in the weeks the professor is explaining (ex. quiz 1 SHOULD cover the information covered between week 2-week 4, but it has questions about week  5 videos - this I found NOT acceptable).

The """"side-dish"" and additional content showed Just how much of a natural teacher professor Joordens is. Having working in training delivery I have seen the effect on delivery of the dedicated and instinctive nature of the trainer.  The fact that Professor Joordens wears his expertise lightly, unlike most people who I have seen deliver talks and sometime when the said ""expertise"" merely involves a week of research to write an article for a newspaper, is really potent quality. My greatest respects are for people like you who further my strongly held value that all knowledge is a shared asset for us and not a resource to be restricted, exploited or traded. For someone who does not engage in social media I hope this message conveys my deepest regards for people involved in bringing to fruition this excellent course.
