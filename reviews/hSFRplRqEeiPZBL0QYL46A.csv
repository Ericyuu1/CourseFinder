I had to look at the transcript instead of the videos.The videos were basic but did not provide sufficient information on how calculations should be made. For example, in week 2, the sleeping students were used (which is a silly example) and it was not clearly shown who the unexposed is because both denominators are the same (n=10).If this is a part of the Master program, I will surely not sign up with Imperial College.

The course is a basic introduction to epidemiology, good for understanding basic concepts. If offered in the future, I hope the organisers will improve on the following: (1) focus more on interpretation of various frequency and measures of association. I believe this was not stressed enough and it is paramount. More practical examples in the lectures. Ensure the quizzes have the correct solution in the quiz feedback, sometimes it is not present. On week 4, the last quiz, question 17 does not correctly record the correct answer. Also, in terms of terminology, I found it limiting to speak only in terms of ""disease"", as opposed to ""outcome"", since epidemiology doesn't only deals with disease, but rather outcomes of interest which can also  be positive (i.e. survival, etc)",0,0,Raluca Banciu,747201
