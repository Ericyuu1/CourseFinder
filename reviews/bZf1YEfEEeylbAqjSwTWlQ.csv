106607865~COURSE!~bZf1YEfEEeylbAqjSwTWlQ,1656515245007,1,0,"I found this really tough to follow. It felt apart from the other courses in the specialization. Whilst some modules  were hard to grasp because it felt as though a lot of terms and much of the context around a certain point had been omitted, other modues felt very basic and were frankly quite tedious. Unfortunately I didn't find the speaker very engaging like in other courses in the specialization. I also found it difficult to pass the quizzes because i didnt think they accurately reflected the learning content. I also find much of what was said hasn't sunk in becasue of this.",0,2,Hannah Tomlin,106607865
