93767688~COURSE!~IOsOsFuOEem_8hIEUnmzSA,1672418235658,1,0,"The efficiency level of lectures is awfully low. The lectures are delivered in such a way that it feels like the lecturer is reading a script. Besides that, quizzes are not structured according to the lectures delivered. If a lecture video has detail or quality of 3/10, the quiz has difficulty level of 10/10. ",0,0,Danial Javaid,93767688

56540227~COURSE!~IOsOsFuOEem_8hIEUnmzSA,1641681103034,3,0,"T​he course is of intermediate-advanced level. The material is quite good, and the instructors manage to convey the gist of the discipline, testing your understanding wirh quizzes and above all 'problems' requiring numerical and graphical evaluations.   Why only three stars? Three issues: i) there is no course material, neither notes nor slides (not even a recommended texbook). When requiring to extensively use equations, this is particularly bad. ii) There are several  issues with some problems and/or autocorrector, including also typos; some of these have been identified and reported on the Forum, with no consequence. I found problem of week 4 particularly challenging to pass (mostly because of 'crazy' and unstated tolerance of the numerical corrector)  iii) There is no instructor present in  the Forum to answer queries or fix bugs. All this suggests a poorly professional maintenance of the course, which seems abandoned despite being new. ",0,1,Pasquale Dario Serpico,56540227
