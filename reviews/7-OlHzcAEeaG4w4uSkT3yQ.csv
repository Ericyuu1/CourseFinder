21263287~COURSE!~7-OlHzcAEeaG4w4uSkT3yQ,1616456604163,1,0,"Was very disappointed by this course after being very excited about it. I don't know if I over estimated my tech savy for an ""intermediate"" level. I'm not a programmer in anyway, but the course descriptions doesn't seem to imply that students need to be super knowledgeable with that. I thought I'd be fine with an intermediate level since I don't mind alittle research to figure things out if need be and have done some HTML/CSS coding. However, with the information given in this course and hardly any explanation about how to set up systems/packages needed to complete the assignments, the course should be marked as ""advanced"". In addition to the install ""X"" and run ""Y"" with minimal to no guidance on how to do that, links on the course don't work and the few steps the instructor actually does take you through to set up a developer account on Twitter to get the ""keys"" you need for an assignment is done on an old page layout that is completely different now and highly confusing to figure out especially when trying to follow the instructor. Overall huge waste of time and money and hugely disappointed with coursera for offering this course as is and the instructor for the also obvious lack of presence. On the student discussion page there were several other students  who were having the same problems as me and they either got no reply or only responses/help from other students. I was really excited to get to learn some basic data analytics skills especially using social media/Twitter which is so fun. Instead I didn't even finish the course as it wasn't worth hours of frustration to me trying to figure out advanced coding to get the assignments to work. I hope this saves anyone who is a beginner with data analytics from doing this course. If you have only a little bit of programming knowledge, find a beginner course and don't pay for this one!",0,3,Abby Schneiss,21263287

There are Youtube channels made by teenagers which are more helpful than this course whose only goal is to get money from people who need certificates. It is ridiculously bad - there are no explanations for anything, the teaching is lazy and relies on the fact that the students will simply run the provided code. Well, even that is not possible because the codes do not work most of the time. This puts you in a situation where you know nothing in order to produce results yourself, and you cannot even reproduce the results. I cannot believe that this thing is allowed to exist here. It is shocking. I would not even list all the problems - I don't think there is a single week of the course where you can simply run the provided scripts without googling random programming sites for about 8 hours.If you simply want to get money from people and not teach them anything, at least don't be lazy...In addition, the discussion forums are a long list of people asking for their assignments to be graded. Something that I would enjoy as well!!! However, this is another instance of laziness. The ""quizzes"" are basically asking ""did you do it"" and then any answer works, while for the more serious part it is expected from students to do the work.

The assignments are all just of the form ""copy-paste and get this provided script to run on your computer"", and there is no verification or feedback on submissions.

Good demonstration about the packages used for this analysis for Python and R, before this course I didn't know about Tweepy, NLTP, textblob etc. to do the analysis directly3. The assignments were not too difficult, sometimes faced challenges due to code not working or data availability. ( The Yelp data set needed in Week 3 is  about 10 GBs!)4. Course is not too difficult or time intensive to finish or work onCons:its just an introduction towards Social media analytics, do not expect much.You will not be taught the introduction and work around for python and R, although the course says that you do n't need to know the programming languages to work, but if you don't know then you are in trouble. Many times code will not work or you will not be able to convert the file or save the file as instructed in the videos, so expect a good proportion to be spent on Internet searching for solutions.The community is almost dead, All the 4 weeks I faced problems in my code because I am from non programming background and so I posted on the forums but got exactly 0 replies from the Instructor and the Course staff. As a result, I had to resort to internet search and trial and error for running the provided codes since I am not a hardcore programming guyThe course is fun to learn and get introduction to data analytics but don't expect to go and apply these concepts in your organization. Reason? they don't tell you how to get big amounts of data for your organization or the professional social media data providers available who provide large amount of data to organizations to do analysis on. If you want to run an analysis of 50 tweets or 25 you tube videos then its fine anything more than that? Good luck trying to mine Youtube video for 2000-3000 videos or 10,000-20,000 tweets ( which is the minimum amount you will need to run an analysis on and get the correct results) through Python and free APIs Overall, a fun introductory way to know about Social media analytics but don't expect too much and do not expect to be a social media data scientist through this course. Also, if you are planning to pay I would suggest to get introduced to programming in Python and R so that you won't face problems when the provided codes do not run and no one in the forums answers your query",0,13,Dr Siddharth Mishra,6525246
