I understand the steps can be different for different purposes, but there must be some common rules and approach.

I left it for a while (maybe 2 - 3 weeks) then when i returned  i skimmed through the from the start to where i stopped then continued.     Things we getting much better with me.One concern however, the professors were speaking some difficult  vocabulary  (not the simpler english style)   - upon which  i had to look in the dictionary quite a few times.   - but i guess this was because they were selecting very specific meanings to specific exact words they wanted to use.Thank you very much for this great experience :)",0,0,Dina Riad,28005786

Students have the opportunity to learn about the main features of serious games (definition, how they work, kinds of serious games and other topics). Videos are engaging because learners are encouraged to participate not only by answering questions about content, but also to answer short surveys or to play a game. Also, students are invited to try a lot of games in order to get familiar with serious games. The suggested readings are very interesting (I read most of them). Teachers are nice and enthusiastic. Finally, I liked the course because I had enough time to review concepts and also to play the games. I mean, I learned a lot without feeling overwhelmed.  ",0,2,Deleted Account,12302942
