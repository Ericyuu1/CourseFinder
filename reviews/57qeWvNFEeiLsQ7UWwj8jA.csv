At no point did I go into an assignment and say, ""oh yes, I know exactly how to do this."" I completed the assignments all with a lot of trial and error, which is fine and normal for learning programming I think, but because the assignments were often to edit a smaller portion of a larger, more complicated program, it meant I it was difficult to really understand where things were going wrong. I mostly just had to try and try until I got it right.  Some of the portions of the final project I actually felt fairly successful with, but others I struggled with in the same way. So ultimately I feel that this is a decent course for a fairly experienced programmer to get acquainted with the differences of a language they're not expert in, but for someone new it may go mostly over their head unless that have more outside help.

I was looking at the two Princeton Data structures and algorithms on Coursera which also has good reviews, but they only use Java. I'm applying to Tesla and SpaceX, both companies use python and C++ for most of their software automation and especially their time-sensitive systems (simulators, controllers, etc). I decided to take this course instead of the Princeton course as I didn't want to spread my focus too far on languages none of my target companies are using (Java). This course was super inspirational. I honestly can go to sleep being comfortable with memory management and pointers. I would take any course taught by Wade Fagen-Ulmschneider (the professor) in a heart beat. Another good resource is ""The Cherno"" on youtube (ex. Game engine software engineer at EA).

Starts off with an in depth analysis of the different types of memory storage in C++ (and how they are used by a computer in general). After this detailed start, using very minimal but precise code, It then rapidly starts developing the all the other fundamental data structures in C++, moving at quite a fast pace until one has a nice broad overview. It then culminates in a substantial project, where the requirement is not so much to add a large amount of new code, but instead to assimilate the code base and use very precise logic to implement the functions.The course develops a rigorous approached to coding based on unit test/test frameworks. The multiple choice quiz questions are challenging and very well thought out, such that you will really have to think carefully about them, and in so doing will consolidate your knowledge.Overall, I've really enjoyed this first course in the Specialization and look forward to progressing onward through the rest of it.If you have no prior coding experience, or are new to Computer Science, you will probably find this course tough going, so I'd advise you perhaps do a couple of easier introductory courses first.The fact that this course is based on C++ is a major PLUS in my view, as far too many courses are now dominated by Python, yet C++ is an industry standard language used for serious software engineering projects and major systems due to its extreme power and performance.
