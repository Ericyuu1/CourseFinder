The subject matter is very interesting and I wished it had reasonable support (mentor response) and portability (meaning running on my own computer). Unfortunately, while Mr. Moroney does an excellent job at presenting the class, the exercises are unstable, crash for reasons other than my own code and there is ABSOLUTELY ZERO tech support! The discussion forum is an empty echo chamber. As usual, one wastes time trying to debug  stupid python routine crashes that have nothing to do with the actual problem at hand.

11452606~COURSE!~5h_UG_EaEemQmRLkaCDi9A,1604312706375,2,0,There is just too much within this course and I think it should be splitted at least within Embedded applications and Mobile applications: rarely is a person interested in both fields. The quantity of the contents makes the course dispersive and topics almost uncorrelated. After succeeding in the course you do not feel you acquired any new skill but you just discovered that Tensorflow Lite exists. However I do not think one will be able to use this in practice after this course.Please take care of the walk-through of this and the previous course: the quality of those videos is so bad that the code in it is unreadable. External slides (with text content that can be copied and pasted) would be a strong plus of this course as well as for the others.,0,2,Francesco Boi,11452606

From all the Tensorflow specialization so far I found it the most difficult as it requires advanced knowledge on app development, even though not mandatory to validate the course. It shows well however the value and use case of bringing tensorflow to those device. I think that one of the greatest difficulty with TFlite is that we are switching to ""3rd party"" ecosystem, that requires important effort to convert interfaces of the different worlds, aka tensorflow ""python"" ecosystem to Android/IOS ecosystems. This is anyway great material that bring incredible value to path the way for inferencing at the edge.",0,0,clement le roux,17989333
