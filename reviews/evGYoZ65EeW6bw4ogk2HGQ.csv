However, he isn't a very good lecturer (rambling and not very clear). Sometimes his message is not clear (even listening a few times and reading the transcript), and it was difficult trying to locate the original research that he's talking about, because no written references are provided and one can't even really be sure of how the authors' names are spelled.Having taken several Coursera courses, I was also severely disappointed in the lack of interaction with other learners. The forums are mostly abandoned, and there appear not to be any humans behind the running of the course. It's like on autopilot since after its first run in 2014.All in all, I think the content would be most interesting if presented better, but it was a disappointing, if not downright frustrating, Coursera experience.

Please consider this highly negative review as an sting, an encouragement for the authors to make it better ! In my opinion, the course lacks some material, I would expect more links to external articles or sources.Then I would expect more interesting videos : most of the time, Prof Arturo Hernandez speaks to the camera, and there is almost no illustration to support the discourse, and when there is some, it is sometime difficult to understand or even to read. The course could have as well been offered as an audio podcast!Asking a question after each video is a good thing, but unfortunately, I had many times the feeling that it could have been better chosen or formulated. I would rather have first a quiz testing if the student understood and memorized the main facts presented, to then have maybe questions requiring more thinking. More disturbing: there seems to be some errors in the final quiz (which is easy to spot because the questions are the same as those in the intermediate quizzes each week), those errors have been reported in the forum one year ago, and are still there! No staff seem to actually read the forum/But the most disturbing in the course is the lack of a good solid structure. Some videos last 1 minute , others 19 minutes, it give a feeling of inconsistency. When Prof Hernandez lectures, he seems sometimes not fully prepared, as if improvising, hesitating ... He too often cites research papers or refers to studies results for adding then that the results were inconclusive, subject to caution, questionable, or even rebutted by some later study.  What's the conclusion then?One thing I liked are the office hours videos! Interesting questions addressed in a more natural and agreeable way.",0,7,olivier hergault,3840079

There is a weekly forum, but posting there will not result in a reply, neither by students nor by the professors. There are weekly 'office hours' videos, but these reference questions from an earlier run-through of the course, so that feels a little strange to watch. Other areas for improvement are that there are no reading materials at all, though lots of research is referred to (Prof. Hernandez is very knowledgeable in his field). Also, the quiz/exam system becomes very predictable, and someone taking notes in a smart way can easily score 100% on the exam, provided questions 53 and 56 are fixed.

What I would suggest for improvement, however, is to also provide accurate spelling for the names of all the researchers introduced. The English transcript was far from accurate. It was possible to check the correct names from quizzes and exams, and I went back to revise the names on my class notes. But for some of the studies without the correct names of researchers it was difficult to look up additional resources. Also, someone else mentioned this earlier but I would also ask for a brief overview of brain regions. I could look up ""intro to anatomy"" material for med students, but the perspective and density of information is different from the focus of this course, so it was quite challenging to grasp all the regions and their functions mentioned in this course.
