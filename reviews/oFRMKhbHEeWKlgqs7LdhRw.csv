7734437~COURSE!~oFRMKhbHEeWKlgqs7LdhRw,1591054144264,1,0,I had to extend the course twice because there is no system to ensure that assignments are peer-reviewed on time. Even if one completes all the tasks ahead of schedule. They could have moderators to ensure that learners are no inconvenienced for not having enough students enrolled in the course to meet the peer-review criteria.
