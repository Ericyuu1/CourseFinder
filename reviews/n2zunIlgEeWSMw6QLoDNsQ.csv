For me, someone who had written exactly one program in basic back in 1984 on an Apple Plus, the pace felt rapid. The content is really solid, but to someone who has had lots of recent practice with some of the concepts, like a contemporary high school student, it probably doesn't come across as high-density. I could have used a slower pace to aborb the new ideas in each lesson before plunging into the next assignment, but I imagine this course is just right for a lot of people. I'm taking a break before starting Part 2 to take a course with Charles Severeance @ U. Mich. ""Python for everyone"" on EdEx, for more practice before I get in deeper here. If you think you might be more like me and need an ""on-ramp,"" you might try that course first before taking Part 1 of this course. Just don't give up on this course, it's great!

The lectures are fun - educational without being dry. I appreciate the light humor. Concepts are taught in a generally fun way, although perhaps not quite as rigorously as one would like. Here are the main issues: much of the course is build on Python 2; while a Python 3 interface is included, it is still jarring - and almost certainly confusing to beginners - to see print statements without () and such. The course needs to be redone in Python 3, particularly since as of 2020 Python2 is officially dead.Second - and this is true of -all- courses that try to assist beginners by creating a custom interface to do all the work - none of the work can be done outside of the custom interface (CodeSkulptor) without a fair amount of work that would be far beyond a beginner at first (and as noted, CodeSkulptor was built on Python 2). I get the desire to ease the onramp in the beginning, but I think it causes more issues down the road. People that are really motivated to learn want to work in their own IDEs.I am torn on the peer-reviewed aspect. On the one hand - yes, seeing other code is interesting and educational. On the other hand - how motivated are all students in doing a thorough review? How motivated are people to actually look over other people's code? How educational is it to see code from other -beginners-? The best courses I've taken so far have all had comprehensive, automated programming tasks. I think that's the better way to go.I think the course needs more 'finger exercises' to really build up muscle memory for key concepts. Each section has lots of excellent 'practice exercises' - have those as automated grading exercises!

Personally , I took this course to practice python programming as I had a bit of  programming experience in my first sem of college. But , I must say I wish I had taken this course earlier ie. as a complete beginner. The approach followed by the professors is ""Just in Time"" and not flooding the lectures with as much info as they can. 

The highlight of the course are ofcourse the Games that you get to make using SimpleGui. ( My personal favourite is the Black Jack - taught me a great deal of things about OOPS). After completing both IIPP-1 and IIPP-2 I now feel a lot more comfortable while reading other people's code. So, all in all even though you will be making games here, the skills you learn will be applicable everywhere.
One thing I was worried about before taking this class was that it is in Python 2. I can assure you this won't be a problem as-
The only difference you will notice in Python 3 is that print is a function now and / is used a little differently that's all. 

For advanced and semi-advanced people this course may be a bit dull just like any Introduction Course.  But for beginners and those who are not yet comfortable in writing long lines of code this course is simply one of the best.

Videos, readings and exercises are designed with the greatest care to deliver each week’s key concept. Quizzes are not only for testing but make learners ready to implement mini-projects. You would realize the projects are best implemented only when you thoroughly understand and rigorously apply what you’ve learned. The projects are technically integrated into Codeskulptor, a web-based platform that was specially customized for this course.Secondly, these interconnected materials are delivered in very humane manner. Learners may be having hard times because of a strangely new way of computational thinking. But don’t worry: the professors’ energy and friendliness will raise you up. The chemistry between them created a welcoming vibe which reminded me to come back to the class for nine months.Due to the good impression from this course, I got great interest in the master of CS program at Rice University. I know, as of May 2020, the entire academia is going through tough times because of COVID19 and the application numbers may be under the professors’ expectations. But I hope MCS will be back on track with these great faculty members and pedagogical quality.

I found that I got much more insight into good programming techniques and when to use them from this than previous reading through books. You do all your programming in a browser rather than actually using Python itself. Initially I wasn't sure about this (as I already had Python installed) but it works really well and means that, unlike some courses, you don't have to spend the first hour or so trying to install software. The documentation is really easy to use (you use this a lot!) and the ability to step through your program and see exactly what's going on at each step has been really helpful as well. I've almost finished Part 2 of this course but already I've got the skills to start building some programs that I thought would be well beyond me. As usual, the different ways of accessing Coursera (PC, iPad etc.) don't seem to line up very well but that's not the fault of this course. Overall, highly recommended. ",0,4,Phil Smith,30569931

They really make programming accessible to anyone with the way that they teach, and they make the content really fun. Yes, the material can be challenging at some times, but with all the lectures, homework and support, I truly think anyone can finish this course. I'm enrolled in the full specialization and a note to others. Enroll in all the courses at once and then in your enrollments page you can adjust the sessions that you want to take by hitting the three dots button. I made the mistake of waiting till I finished part one to enroll in the next course and it caused me to skip a session so I had to sit around waiting for two weeks until the next session started. Programming is a language so it helps the learning process to work on it every day, don't make the same mistake I made!
