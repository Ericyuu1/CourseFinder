73316407~COURSE!~D_JJYt5TEeq6iAqXjVLXlQ,1659152708476,1,0,I am intigued by sales force but this is half sales picth and a couple of really cool glimpses into what salesforce can be. I have literally been stuck in limbo with no support other than a couple community memebers. I am stuck on a module (that others are as well)  and everyone is telling me to create another playground. If I am doing such BASIC things that get gliched up that I have to create multiple playgrounds - that makes me worry about bigger and more intense projects. Also wasting 2 hours today waiting for playgrounds to be built and getting the error code - we couldnt build the playground - try again. I think I would have a better time just leaning in Trailblazer - to a point because the gliches have made me waste a whole day.,0,0,Kelly Kelley,73316407

104570019~COURSE!~D_JJYt5TEeq6iAqXjVLXlQ,1652112118535,2,0,"If you're brand new to Salesforce like I was don't take this course. It touches very briefly on some fundamentals and covers a lot of admin stuff rather than day to day user functions. The modules/reading assignments are jumbled. The list will start with an admin module and you will be confused about all aspects of the reading material just to realize that three readings/modules down is the basics reading that you should have started with in order to understand the admin. In week three of the course, you are asked to complete a very long admin level module and when you get to the challenge (quiz), you are told that in order to complete it you need the knowledge covered in another module which isn't even  part of the course. The videos are short and useless because they just cover select parts of the reading... but technically you are supposed to read prior to getting to the video so it's a waste of time. Finally the homework is uploading screenshots of all the completed readings which is multiple files in a specific order however only one file is allowed to be uploaded so you need to create a word doc to get around it but then if you have a grader (it's all peer reviewed) who is particularly strict he/she may not open the file and scroll down so you fail. The course did introduce me to Salesforce but in a way where I learned that I can discover all the lessons on my own since Salesforce has a free learning tool available to everyone. Google Salesforce Trailhead to get started. It is very intuitive and you can learn parts of Salesforce that are relevant to your career. No need to waste money on this course.
