82792059~COURSE!~_4PvQlqdEeW5ChKOjFc59Q,1625768523790,1,0,"I couldn't stand this course.  I found the structure not clear, the instruction meandering and the exams were designed to ensure I went through the content in detail rather than really get the core concepts.  On the upside, the instructor looks a lot like an old friend of mine.",0,1,Brian German ,82792059
7864774~COURSE!~_4PvQlqdEeW5ChKOjFc59Q,1648650038007,2,0,"T​he course is poorly organized. The professor use of concepts such as "" Marble mouth"" sounds very non-academic. No reference material. No practical cases. Especially, the most problematic aspect is assesment quizzes very poorly worded and based on how you crammed the words instead of understanding. In more than 50 courses I completed from Coursera, this was the worst experience. ",0,0,Arif Ul Haq,7864774
1623655~COURSE!~_4PvQlqdEeW5ChKOjFc59Q,1535201561788,2,0,I think this course is too messy to understand for a newbie. The lecturer describes some jargons with examples but sometimes I could not understand what they are. I do not recommend this course if you do not have confidence in this area.,0,1,Takayuki Kaisen,1623655
16271692~COURSE!~_4PvQlqdEeW5ChKOjFc59Q,1505676234348,2,0,"This course could have been chiseled down to one 30-minute lecture. So much of it was annoying jargon (WTF is ""Marble Mouth""?), overdrawn abstract rambling and obvious back-and-forth speak on hypothetical situations (e.g. ""Doing too much of this thing would be too much, but at the same time, doing too little would be too little, so you want to do the right amount.""). Thanks! I would have preferred a few core concepts with many real-world examples, real-world resources on where to find market or IP data, etc. This professor seems to be detached from the outside world and living in his own sphere of terminology and business-school fluff.",0,1,GYQB,16271692
33220106~COURSE!~_4PvQlqdEeW5ChKOjFc59Q,1549036542818,3,0,"This course could have been made more concise. Some of the information was very basic or frankly unnecessary. The exams did not test you on concepts but on how well you listened to the lectures and remembered them. It helped me learn a few business concepts and the template is a good place to start if you are a novice. Overall, I was pretty underwhelmed by the course. ",0,1,Raeesa Gupte,33220106
38188664~COURSE!~_4PvQlqdEeW5ChKOjFc59Q,1545226410139,4,0,"This course was really helpful for me - a business development professional on the begging of career. I've been working on business development for a whole year now and I can totally identified myself with the professor's saying: ""The highs are really high the lows are really low and the time between the two is very short. So, try not to get too high. Try not to get too low try and run the middle as best you can and just keep focused on your business plan and press through."" Kind regards from Brazil!

The filter's applications,  how to calibrate and improve filters were my favorite parts. The invited speakers were very cool, to see in practical the theoretical aspects.

This course is exactly what is needed for anyone working in a radical innovation space. It provides guidance on how to determine what to pursue. I hope there will be a part 2 that focuses more on what to do after you've chosen your ideas.,0,0,Shenequa Aranda,26208646

The Theory and Exercises are all good - the course questions for the quizes/exams are sometimes too hard. It could be a little more ' considerate ' regarding company politics, culture or circumstances - and not too rigid. Overall, great learning experience.",0,0,Tjerja Geerts,13784646
