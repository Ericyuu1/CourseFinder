Although Coursera did not provide much course related to international relation and politics, it`s still a honor to join this wonderful class. However, there are some place that Coursera and professor Moon Chung-in can do better. Firstly, I want more course about ""principles"" such as introduction of international relation and principle of macroeconomic, which can help students like me to develop a more constantly knowledge.Secondly, course interaction is so rare that I did not see any of it. The forum of class did not be fully use by our students and it seems like everyone is not interested in communicating with each other which really bother me.Finally, I know professor Moon Chung-in is really busy since he is a well-known scholar in this field.
