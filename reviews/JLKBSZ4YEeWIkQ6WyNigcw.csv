Most of the links on the first page link to sites that are no longer running. I only skimmed through the intro lecture, but there was a lot of photos from google. There's a paper on preventing chronic pain, so I checked out the journal it came from, the Global Advances in Health and Medicine journal. Literally the second link from the top is a recipe on how to make a weed cake. Why??? The article seems to be legit, though. This course needs some upkeep. It probably could've been useful.

84035763~COURSE!~JLKBSZ4YEeWIkQ6WyNigcw,1669872622136,4,0,"With a background in physiotherapy and a fairly good working knowledge of chronic pain, this course is a useful add-on and a refresher for ways to approach management for people with chronic pain. I enjoyed the lectures that had a bit more science behind them, as well as the very clinically driven elements for TMJ and fibromyalgia especially. I think this could be a useful course for professionals without significant chronic pain experience as it covers some of the science, as well as management strategies and frameworks to use with patients while managing their pain. For the general public, I think you can probably pick and choose as some subjects may not be relevant to you (ie, the rather beefy fibro section if you have headaches, if the pain mechanism/science feels a bit too full on, etc). From what I understand, the course has been reworked somewhat. I'm not sure if that restructure has caused some continuity problems, or what. I found some of the guest lecturers seemed to refer to things we hadn't talked about, or referenced something ""in an upcoming module"" we had long since covered. Some of the videos were somewhat repetitive (regarding the 7 realms), and I believe it could be streamlined while still retaining the same content. Overall, I appreciated this robust course as it had a good breadth of content, and it had plenty of hours to add to my yearly PD requirements. ",0,0,Erin Cruse,84035763

All the speakers are experts in this topic, and I had previously read a lot of research papers published by them, so this is another advantage of this course for me.  Just to say something that could improve the course, I would say that it was prepared in 2014 and after 6 years some new scientific findings could be explained or added to the presentations.

The videos and outlines give you what you need to pass the course yet they provide articles, research data, links and handouts to use if you desire. There is also a follow along with a novel that I still have to finish. I have recommended the course to many of my doctors already.
