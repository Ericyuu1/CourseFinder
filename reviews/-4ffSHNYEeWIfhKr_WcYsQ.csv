103253642~COURSE!~-4ffSHNYEeWIfhKr_WcYsQ,1664023678931,1,0," After completing my 5th course in this series, and experiencing progressively poorer quality and more issues, I decided to write this review. Had I known of these issues when starting this specialization, I would not have started. Here are the issues with this course:  1. Most of the lectures/posts/etc are 10+ years old. Not only are they old, they are in need of refresh, update, and quality improvements. 2. Several of the classroom lectures are of hideous quality. Students mumbling to themselves and asking questions to the instructor are not audible beyond just background noise, and the instructor himself is barely audible. Even the fascinating 30 min case study lecture sounds like it was recorded in a wind tunnel.  3. Programming assignments could use a significant refresh and update. The data to analyze stopped in 2011 as an example. As another, instructions suggest the 2nd assignment should take 2 hours…it took me more than 2 hours to troubleshoot an issue trying to publish to rpubs.com. The instructions covered “push publish”, which simply didn’t work. I spent approximately 18 hours on this assignment alone.  4. Peer-grading: the discussion boards are FILLED with “can you please grade my assignment and I’ll grade yours” posts. These should be not allowed, deleted, cleaned up, students punished/disenrolled, etc. This didn’t just start as you can find these posts going back 8+ years through today. Because of this issue, good luck trying to find any solutions to real problems and/or post your real problems. Additionally, over the past 5 courses, about 20% of the peer submissions I’ve been asked to submit were essentially non submissions. Why would a student go through the process to submit something that includes no actual work? One reason/motivation: to open up the peer-grading and plagiarize.  5. As far as I can tell, there is no repository of solutions…i.e. it would be great if after submission/grading/course completion, a student could view some actual possible solutions. Even if the solutions could somehow be sanitized to protect the valued JHU honor system, it would immensely help some students to see options/techniques to solve these assignments. In my experience, I stumbled through using clunky coding to barely get R to do what the assignment asks.   ",0,0,,103253642

In one of the projects we're given a data-set that doesn't show straight up what to do with it, even with a clear set of instructions.  And this is something common in terms of data analysis that everyone eventually faces with.  This isn't the kind of difficult in terms of technicality, but still took me a couple of times to complete because of the maturity and independence needed to just ""tackle"" the data.
