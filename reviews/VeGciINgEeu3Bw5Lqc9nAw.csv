10869350~COURSE!~VeGciINgEeu3Bw5Lqc9nAw,1664639204372,5,0,"E​xcellent course. I particularly liked the practical application of the algebraic functions. Videos are to the point and unlike some other courses, I watched all these videos at normal speed. Other courses I've run the videos at 125 or 150%.I​t would be nice if there was a way to print the notes (or maybe there is and I didn't see it.)  They would be a great refresher if you weren't using algebra on a regular basis.",0,0,Michael Martin,10869350
