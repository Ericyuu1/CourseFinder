84554979~COURSE!~TLRQ4jKpEeycGBKEuRb8CQ,1677557776320,1,0,"I have given this course four weeks and am officially firing the instructor. I find the videos unintuitive. They lack a description of concepts and rather focus on the mechanics first when I don't even understand why this matters or have a conceptual framework with which to undersatnd it. I have taken to Youtube to learn the concepts, remove the consuion caused by the Coursera videos and come back to take the assessment on Coursera. I would suggest deeplearning.ai hire 3BlueOneBrown from YT to develop proper videos.  The workbooks often test me on things I expect the course to teach me first. For example, there is a graded assignment on neural networks in which you code a neural net. Yet this info is not provided in the videos, and the description in the notebook is meager at best. I have spent over 30 HOURS on the workbooks trying to decode what they are asking me to do.  I manage to finish each but It's no way to learn. If you plan to take this course, I would strongly suggest clicking ahead and sample the videos and labs in detail and decide if this is for you.  Oh, and put Python as a requisite on the description page! ",0,1,Drew Wilkins,84554979

The videos are masterfully explained and I loved every second, but the python assignments are very buggy, especially the one from week 3.  I believe that the main problem with these assignments is that they are a bunch of code that you can't understand absolutely anything. I strongly recommend that deeplearning update this codes with comments on each line so that we can understand step by step what is being done.  Also, I went through several situations where the value was correct, the cell test was green, but the grader gave me 0/100. The errors menssage from the grader do not explain the reason for the error at all.

From this course I remembered knowledge that I learned 20 years ago while studying Systems Engineering - linear regressions as a form of AI, taking advantage of parallel computing was interesting. However, evaluating basic procedures as computing a matrix determinant by hand and other operations, are not relevant to the direct relationship with AI and DS.

Finding the community/discussion page for this course was confusing and it took more clicks than it should. Quizzes were introduced a lot in the beginning but I felt they were lacking in the middle weeks. My most important feedback is that I feel the course did not adequately explain the applications of the lessons we were learning. We need deeper explanations/comparisons/illustrations showing how the mathematical concepts are applied in ML, I know there are labs but I felt they weren't enough. Instructors aren't replying to many of the questions posted in the forums which their answers do in fact matter.The answers to the quiz questions are sometimes not explained,  you do have it 90% of the time but sometimes it just shows ""Correct!"" which does not show the work done for the answer. , also linking each question to the lectures would much appreciated (I know sometimes its there but not always.).

5973608~COURSE!~TLRQ4jKpEeycGBKEuRb8CQ,1676923440878,4,0,"Overall, I think this was a good introduction to linear algebra.  It was fairly easy to follow along and complete assignments.  I learned a bunch and got some new perspective on my overall journey as data scientist.  If you want to be successful with this, I would recommend actually doing some extra practice manipulating matrices, playing with the different dynamic graphs this course offers to get some more intuition with how things move and possibly doing some supplemental learning watching youtube videos on anything that gave you trouble or checking out the same material on Khan Academy (recommendations they give as well).Things became really confusing to follow around the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.  I had to rewatch the videos a handful of times to try to piece together what was happening and how.  There was a couple ""Tada!"" moments and I wasn't sure how we'd gotten where we were.  When it came time to do the quiz, I had a couple questions I had to guess since I couldn't make the connection from what I was lectured on vs. how to complete problems I was seeing.   To be fair, I could have leveraged the forum more to ask questions and gain clarity but you have to go to a different website, register another account, scroll past the first page of announcements and general discussion, reverse the order of the thing you're looking for to find the math specialization header, click into that to find the M4ML Course 1 (not the Linear Algebra course that my brain is looking for) and then the specific week you're in.  As a Coursera user, there are some basic things in certain places that I expect to find them. I'm sure there are reasons for everything but this course lacks a key integration for a classroom when you have to go on a small journey that requires more personal information be doled out just to have a conversation with your peers and teachers.",0,2,Nicholas Swarr,5973608

For example I don't recall covering the relation between rank of a matrix and number of eigenvalues (and eigenvectors). The difference between eigenvector and eigenbasis.
