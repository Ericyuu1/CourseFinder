1407613~COURSE!~TWNon2r-Eeumww4A4k-nvw,1670616929056,1,0,"I didn't expect the course to be such lecture feel: no Power Point slides, no interactive elements, no well-prepared graphics, videos, scripts.  It's just someone using an online whiteboard writing ad-hoc things and teaches sponteneously.  And the lecturer teaches fast, as if it's all just revision for contents that we should have already known.  In no time, he thinks we are all masters and the 10 questions are all tricky ones that take quite some time to solve.  This is by far the worst Coursera course I have ever tried.  I expected far more than this.  Last time when I enrolled Logic i and II taught by Melbourne University, it was a whole different level of experience.  We had 100-page well written and detailed notes that explain everything we learned from the course videos; the videos were professionally produced with the two lecturers explaining all key concepts at a great pace for beginners.  That was a 5 star course.  In comparison, this course is very under-prepared, the contents feel like ad-hoc created.  It's like an experienced maths teacher was asked suddenly to handle a maths lesson, and he goes in the classroom to  just go by what he knows about the subject - experienced, knowledgable, but unprepared.  And I don't see any team backup or support here; otherwise at least I would have seen some more attractive and effective use of Power Point slides or something like that.  In simple words, the production quality of this course is very disappointing.  It reminds me of going in some very unprepared lecturers' lessons in university.  Good scholars maybe, but bad teaching.  This is far worse than some online free resources such as  Schoolyourself.org which teaches maths far better and cost nothing.",0,0,Thomas C. K. Tam,1407613

I gave a correct answer and in the query that was posted, it stated that I couldn't put in anything other than the numerical answer. They wanted no signs of any kind, just the numerical answer. I had the correct answer. They told me I didn't because I didn't have the P and approximate sign with the numerical answer.  Your course displayed the answer would be correct if I included the very items with the correct numerical answer, which is the one I gave. Yet, you marked incorrect because I followed your instructions and didn't place anything other than the numerical answer in the box.Your professor speaks way too fast. That is not constructive.I need to take another course with some review of the same material to feel more comfortable with it.

I dropped out before completing traditional high school algebra. Going into the course, the types of problems taught within it seemed arcane to me. I had a very basic grasp of equations and inequalities, and was somewhat familiar with Cartesian coordinates from simple reviews of algebra on Khan Academy. But I definitely did not possess the confidence and patience to solve the problems in this course, especially the word problems. Before the course, I would have read the word problems, had an intuitive idea of how they might be solved, but lacked the confidence, patience, and understanding to actually complete them.A​fter the course, I have been reawakened to the beauty of mathematics for the first time in years.
