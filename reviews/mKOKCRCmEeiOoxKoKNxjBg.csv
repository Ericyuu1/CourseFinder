56525384~COURSE!~mKOKCRCmEeiOoxKoKNxjBg,1589638165338,1,0,"I didn't care for this course and therefore didn't finish it for two reasons. First, it wasn't what I was expecting from the description. I thought it would focus on women's spirituality - their ideas, their experiences, their spiritual development. It's not that at all. There was a great deal of emphasis on names of key women and monasteries, dates, and geography. More importantly, there is little attention to the learning. The videos are attractive and understandable but they are just presentations and not well organized ones at that. There's no cohesive framework to the course. It's a bit like listening to an encyclopedia being read aloud. Not at all the quality I have had in other courses. ",0,10,Maureen Frances Neihart,56525384

I ended up not being able to watch ANY of the videos except the one presenter from Duke University! This was a drawback, as I had looked forward to listening to the videos but then I had to read every single transcript, and the transcripts are full of mistakes; so then I had to go back and listen myself to certain sections to decipher it correctly.

The initial quizzes often focused on side issues and some of the answers were actually wrong.  So it took me several times to pass the initial quizzes which may prove too discouraging for some people taking the course.

The videos were well presented and we got to see some examples of medieval art, monasteries, etc that were relevant to the topic. One thing that does require attention is the fact that most of the male presenters are difficult, and at times impossible, to understand. It's not their accent, that's fine. The problem is that they race through it, swallowing and mispronouncing words. If it wasn't for the transcript I would not have had a clue at times. Even the transcript missed some words. The gentleman who gave the presentation on the Claustra website did so very clearly. I would suggest giving the women more presentations as they were very easy to understand. If I hadn't liked the course so much, I would be taking more points off for the incomprehensibility of the men. ",0,3,Mary Denise Lyons,61077922
