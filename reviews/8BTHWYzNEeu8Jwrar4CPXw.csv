63449062~COURSE!~8BTHWYzNEeu8Jwrar4CPXw,1662802302041,1,0,"T​he content covered in this course is generally good, however there are a number of serious flaws with the course. Throughout the slides in the lectures, the lab explanations and exams there are countless spelling and gramatical errors, leading to ambiguity and in general making the material look very unprofessional. The exam questions are sometimes extremely unclear and poorly written. The activities are clunky, glitchy and difficult to use. The labs are a very poor user experience, instead of providing virtual machines it would be preferable to give students the project files and let students use the OS/IDE of their choice.

100971866~COURSE!~8BTHWYzNEeu8Jwrar4CPXw,1644304852058,1,0,"I have never seen a course designed as bad as this one. I mean, seriously. There is no apparent structure, the explanations are just really hard to follow, it's all reading from the slides, the slides are aweful, often with a bad resolution. It's all you get warned in university not to do in presentations. I don't want to question to expertise of the lecturer, but lecturing is not his forte.
So: Spare yourself the time. I'm convinced Coursera has many wonderful courses out there. This isn't one of them unfortunately.",0,2,Alparslan Yalcin,100971866
