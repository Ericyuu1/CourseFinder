This slows down the progress.Required Level: sometimes lectures feel more math theory than functional programming. This is distracting and serves no purpose. I wonder how people without math background would do if they have to learn / refresh what peano axioms are, how to implement huffman encoding algorithm while learning a fresh new language, etc. There's a reason why the first piece of code in every new language is the Hello World. As someone proficient in several development languages, I always learn the algorithm first, and then look for the implementation. Parallelism: the course fails to establish a parallelism with OO languages in the relevant aspects, so people coming from other languages like Java and C# can really understand what's different in functional programming. There are shallow references when talking about primitives or classes and objects, but nothing serious.

It might be that I am too long in the tooth as an OO programmer that I cannot cope with the transition to functional programming.I found the video lectures initially well structured and stepped nicely in to increasing complexity without losing me. But eventually I fell completely behind and by the time I was performing the exercise 2 submission I was in deep water.  There are a lot of mathematical theory and programming theory references along the way as well which I did not like. As a real world programmer I have never really felt compelled to know peano number theory. And I struggle to understand how performing this exercise prepares me for real-world Scala programming either. I just do not see the point of creating code that can add and subtract numbers without using number types!!! I could write a wrapper for Int in Java in 2 minutes. Doing this abstract Scala exercise would take me all day and I still do not understand the code nor the point of doing it! Whatever happened to maintainability principles ?I have now lost all interest in completing the course because by week 3 I might as well be doing a course in advanced Arabic. I cannot continue this course now because I cannot complete the exercises. I am disheartened and not sure whether this is a reflection of Scala or the course or both.

There is a lot of variability in OSs. Many errors are often encountered. There is no help. Among the things the course requires are two (three?) IDEs for Scala (I note the video tutorials says you just need some sort of IDE... but you need IntelliJ, and Eclipse to submit...). The guides show how to get started on a Mac.

I think you can appreciate this course if you have a background in theoretical computer science, but for all others who choose the course to learn Scala as a language without academic interest, that is just confusing.A Scala beginner can also not appreciate how elegant and concise the produced code is and that you can put the meaning of hundreds of lines of imperative code into only a few lines of functional code  (without side-effects!). For a beginner, it is more important that you can still read and understand your own code two weeks after finishing this course.From other coursera courses, I am used to getting the course material (slides, example code) as a download, either linked in every week's curriculum or in the course overview resources section. For this course, I was not able to find it and have manually typed the exercises during the lectures.

And it's been a great introduction to Scala (a language I had not written code in before).The teaching is very good! Prof Odersky's explanations are very clear and go into the right level of detail, and the exercises and assignments are interesting and seem to be well thought out.I personally would have liked the course to be deeper, both in explaining functional programming (e.g. the monad pattern) and in covering more advanced features of Scala (e.g. the less trivial parts of the type system), but I guess the given course is OK as an introduction and I can also go look for the stuff I'm missing in other courses and/or outside Coursera.Two minor things that damaged the experience to a little extent and which I would recommend to improve for the future: 1. The technical introduction was good enough to get me started, but did not cover some problematic aspects which had me stuck for a long while (it was also very difficult to solve by googling, and a colleague of mine - who's also taking the course - ended up solving it by chance). Specifically I'm talking about worksheets not working properly unless created within a package directory, and for some things unless set to a certain mode of execution (non-REPL). Disclosure: I haven't looked for solutions in the course forums; it's possible that this was asked and answered, or that I could have asked and gotten an answer there. 2. The videos were poorly edited: some bits repeated, some clips were obviously recorded for a specific week number but then given in another week, some parts had obviously been there originally (and other parts referred to them) but then they didn't make the final cut... It's a pity that an otherwise very well made course suffers from such small technical problems, which, while not too grave, cause confusion and increase the mental load the learner has to cope with - which is already laden with challenging stuff - with such non-important and easily avoidable distractions.Thank you!",0,6,Tom Yuval,15287998

Verbose Course Review: I found the learning curve on the first few weeks very steep coming from non-java background, and the references to java methods and types weren't helpful. But once I got past the first two weeks, which I found the most difficult of the whole course, I started to really enjoy the lectures and assignments. Took me much longer to complete than the estimated times as I had to do a lot of reading around the topic to really get my head around the tools introduced. On top of that I found the order in which things are introduced a hinderance. We jump straight into recursive functional programming and only later introduce the object and class structures. As the object structures appear in the examples at the start, I found this confusing as a fresh-eyed learner. Lectures really lack enough examples, and expect you to learn from one very simple example and expand on that in the assignments with much harder implementations. Found the instructions on how to test and debug code challenging, but once I worked it out then my learning really accelerated.

The idea of mixing functional style programming with a language like Scala makes it a good challenge to learn and/or strength two skills in one course.At some points I found some of the assignments more focused on algorithmic problems more than functional programming or Scala itself, which can feel a bit complex.On the other hand classes do not mention almost anything about the performance issues that can arise  when using recursion at this level, which leads to overflow or timeout problems when submitting and grading assignments or if they are used in real work situations. I understand for a first course it could be reasonable.Finally, many exercises in the assignments depend on the previous ones so if you get blocked at one, you may not be able to continue.Overall, I recommend and It's a good course which will for sure improve your programming skills, and combined with other courses in the specialization can be an interesting challenge.Thanks, Ezequiel",0,0,Ezequiel Daniel Di Donato,1196695

In general, pro's include reasonable length lectures, provided by _the_ leading expert in the field, and designer of the Scala language.  Focus on functional programming techniques versus syntax nuance is a significant benefit - Scala is easy to get bogged down in.  Pro's also include the fact that lectures have had at least some amount of post-production work done, and manage to make voiceover/slides/whiteboard consistent and coherent better than most similar online classes/tutorials.The assignments are reasonable, and the time estimates of ~3 hrs each was about right on the average, at least in my case (senior programmer with deep background in C/C++, and just enough Java to be dangerous and dislike boilerplate).Some drawbacks - there was no clear segue from ""basic syntax"" to ""collections framework"".  That's _IMPORTANT_.  In 20/20 hindsight, I would have benefitted from a big, bold slide before the first mention of ""foreach"" that said ""stop here, go to the text, and skim the chapters on collections for 'foreach' and other common operations.  This is a building block for everything to follow, and NOT unique to just lists.""The major factor keeping this from being a '5' in my mind were that the assignments didn't always make sense as written, and I had to go back and forth between the assignment writeup, the source code and the test cases to really sort out what was required.

Also!Why isn't there a native Graphic Scala Lib like Python's Tkinter?Not everybody wants to be a ""Big Data"" Mining Engineer.If Scala can produce graphics from the Java Swing library and experimental ScalaFX graphics lib, then isn't it time for Scala to have it's own native Graphic Library that is at the least as capable as Tkinter for Python.There is no better feeling than the liberating emotion you get from creating programs, games and Apps on your own PC.

While I've embraced immutability and higher-order functions since I started writing Scala, I haven't solved significant programming challenges using functional thinking. Much of what I've already done with Scala so far has been relatively stateless request-response communication between systems, and the challenges so far tend to be on the architecture end.This first course taught me useful things that I hadn't encountered in my industry use of Scala. It has given me greater appreciation for the design of the language and the problems that Scala can solve elegantly. I've also acquired more interest in learning about more functional approaches to various problems -- perhaps I'll dig deeper into SICP at some point!The assignments were a good fit for me -- they were challenging enough that they got me to think but not so hard that I got stuck. Scala's rich type system came in handy for the assignments -- once you've got the right idea for an approach, you just have to get the data structures to click (with some help from the compiler), and things just work!I appreciate that the assignments and examples were realistic. Getting to implement Huffman Coding and basic data structures (functional and OO sets) helped me both appreciate the functional way to solve problems like these, and to understand the class of practical problems where similar solutions are applicable.Great course, and I'm excited for the next ones!
