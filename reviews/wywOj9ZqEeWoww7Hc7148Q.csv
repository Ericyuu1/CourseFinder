I do wish there were more real life/ everyday examples to help me understand the difference between different fallacies/arguments in real life but overall this has still made me notice how some arguments are a fallacy and how I could refute them,0,0,Yu Liu,30057063

understanding of arguments by studying Think Again IV. While Think Again I~III focused
on good arguments, this course taught bad arguments. We learned how to criticize
an argument by recognizing fallacies and refutation. The professor not only presented
good examples of bad arguments, but also explained when we can encounter those
bad arguments, which I enjoyed. Partially because my native language is not English,
I had some challenges on the semantic and syntactic ambiguity. Overall, I learned
a lot about arguments by completing the entire series. I would like to thank
the professors for creating this course!",0,0,Kohei,34639680

I really liked the course content, lecture delivery style, the quiz questions and the explanation provided to support the answers of the questions. However, for some of the questions that you encounter in the quiz, there is little supporting material in the lecture itself. I guess one can get a very good learning by going through the suggested text book in parallel. But since they suggested that the textbook is optional, I haven't gone through it yet. And without the text book, this course is probably a little bit incomplete. This course can be made better by suggesting relevant sections in the book to go through as and when required. Probably that would better equip us in answering the quiz correctly.",0,3,KRISHNA CHAITANYA B,1422303
