13980728~COURSE!~PH-8AiHaEeaCoQrM2bnbCQ,1612492111118,4,0,"To be fair, the introduction makes it very clear that it's an introductory course. I tried it anyway because I liked the concept, but it feels like a rerun of English 101, and the assignments are a bit too constrained to hold my interest.",0,3,Jenni Corbus,13980728

79595567~COURSE!~PH-8AiHaEeaCoQrM2bnbCQ,1612259576838,5,0,"Excellent course! It is, as the title indicates, an introduction to how different kinds of academics reason, with their specific toolsets. The classes are great, very interactive (specially the ""think like a law professor"" one), with a simple quiz after each video and a final peer-reviewed essay at the end of each module. The peer-reviewing was a great experience, with grades for specifics aspects of the text and some space for written feedback. I'd recommend this course to anyone interested on an introduction to academic reasoning.",0,1,Pedro H. Lima,79595567

The examples proposed by the different Professors were fascinating in presenting pro and contra viewpoints of an argument.
