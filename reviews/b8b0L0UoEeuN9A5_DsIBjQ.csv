50231072~COURSE!~b8b0L0UoEeuN9A5_DsIBjQ,1656842239538,2,0,"Pros: The Instructor seems nice.Cons: 1. The estimated time to complete the course is machine-generated. Thus, not accurate. There are 10-minute rated readings that have ten problems to solve which take longer than 10 minutes. 2.  There is zero intuition covered. The whole focus is on solving exercises rather than a deep understanding of the concepts which make you feel like a school student. This is not what math is about.3. Useless materials are covered. I do not see the point of doing five-step exercises that can be done with a line of code.4. Very very very easy and boring material.I hope this is only because this course is a review. my motivation to take the following courses evaporited though. It is just too boring.",0,1,Hashem Rawashdeh,50231072

It gets progressively more difficult and there is little instruction in the lesson videos or reading assignments. Week 4 is maybe too rushed for the complexity of the topic, it deserves at least to weeks worth of instructions.",0,1,Bernardo Cavalcanti,82277169

1869686~COURSE!~b8b0L0UoEeuN9A5_DsIBjQ,1621716416434,5,0,Very interesting and well taught course.  Be prepared to work and think hard.  The final exam might have benefited by the use of integers when testing for vectors in space and planes skills rather than populating the triangle vertices points with square roots.  Instructor's lectures were concise and very clear.  Thank you for the course; very much worth taking.,0,0,John Rogard Tabori,1869686
