This course seems like it would be a useful introduction to these areas.   As with other courses in this series, this course displays some useful shortcuts and streamlined methods for doing this work and  the coded examples are useful to keep as go-bys for use in future work.

On the downside, this course only covers variations on fitting a straight line to your data so it feels rather basic to be classed as ""machine learning"", and is simpler than I would have hoped for an intermediate course.",0,0,Dan Marwick,112243905
