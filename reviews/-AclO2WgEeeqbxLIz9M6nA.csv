6685346~COURSE!~-AclO2WgEeeqbxLIz9M6nA,1595249327468,4,0,"The instructor's peaking is very clear and concise for the very completed concept and equation. The only thing I don't like is that there is no ppt or pdf file to download for study and review. What I did is to make some screenshots for key parts manually and pasted into a ppt file, and then copy the lecturing speaking words as notes under the ppt file.",0,0,Qinwu Xu,6685346

12549499~COURSE!~-AclO2WgEeeqbxLIz9M6nA,1595199150775,5,0,"First two weeks are focused on motion planning and last two weeks on control. The course is touching the topics on the surface without going to deep and that is exactly what I needed. Book chapters, which are required for reading, are pretty complex and the lectures are very helpful to understand the material.",0,0,Maksym Bondarenko,12549499
44916792~COURSE!~-AclO2WgEeeqbxLIz9M6nA,1589097880763,5,0,I loved the course. I think Programming assignments are really challenging. I suggest that some parts of the code should be provided for reference by the instructor. It's really difficult to do write the code from scratch.,0,2,Shubham Takbhate,44916792

41434911~COURSE!~-AclO2WgEeeqbxLIz9M6nA,1562189655286,5,0,"More geared towards real-world applications and examples compared to the previous courses in the Robotics specialization, which were heavier on theory. The assignments are basic but fun to complete. The exercises and use of software are heavily loaded towards the Pathfinding section of the course and ignore the later Force Control section; it could be helpful to include practical exercises in the latter section to help cement the ideas taught there.
