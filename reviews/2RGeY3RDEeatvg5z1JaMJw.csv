Okay let's summarize the problems:First of all. This course does NOT provide any useful math skills. No, in the first 3 courses, you learn a tiny piece of minimum basics of college math.And then comes week 4....... what.. is... this... why.. Any note written on the screen looks like the drafts of college times, where we had no pleasure to even write. It's totally hard to even understand what is being ""explained"" nor to even READ what is being written! It's a total loss of time and money. The only thing worth in this course is the title of the course, written on the certificate. But there absolutely NO quality behind it! I'm honestly disappointed. Half of the quiz-questions are very misleading because of lacking a proper, clear and distinctive use of language (is this math or not???)!! The theory PDFs are okay at the beginning then get worse with each week. There is such a lack of clarity proper explanation!please just delete this course.

The second instructor does not teach content at all. He simply records on his slide what he has calculated off screen. Numbers appear in formulas but rarely is there an explanation given as to where those numbers come from or why they belong in the formula where they are substituted. Furthermore, the slides are just a jumble of notations by the end of he slide so are of no value as a reference note.

It is extremely WEAK in terms explaining those concepts. If you are like me and did this kind of math back in the 70's and 80's but have not used it since, be prepared to seek sources outside Coursera in order to understand the material and pass the quizzes. The instructors leave out explanations and skip important points leaving you confused about the concept.  Example: In the Permutations and Combinations sections, ""results"" of calculations are thrown at you with no explanation of how the instructor got the answer. 10 minutes later, totally as an aside, you get the explanation. The course is not taught in such a way that A leads to B, B leads to C, and C leads.....; instead the instructor will tell you about C, might explain A, and forget about mentioning B until the graded quiz. That is why you will need to fill in the gaps using websites like betterexplained.com or kahnacademy.com. The student is better served by looking at the syllabus and then going to either of those sites - where the explanations are worth your time. In addition to failing to present steps in a logical order, the course often teaches at an extremely basic level but tests at a much, much higher level. Again, to get to the higher level of understanding needed to pass ANY of the required, graded quizzes, the student will need to heavily utilize outside sources. The explanations on the practice quizzes also fail in many cases to thoroughly explain why an answer is correct. Then there are the issues with Coursera itself, the course navigation using Chrome is quite bad. If I did not constantly monitor what part of a course I should be in versus what part of the course automatically loaded next, I often found myself taking a quiz for which no lectures had been presented. The TA's response to my complaint was flippant and WRONG. She then closed my question and I could not respond or ask for more details.If I had it to do over again I would invest my time and money somewhere else.

Why do that? Why not write them while on camera and go through your process of thinking so the viewer can understand better? Oh and there was also an instance where in the middle of a problem he started doing calculations with numbers that appeared out of nowhere and only after he finished did he explain how he got those numbers.

The course feels more like a quick slideshow of rules (logaritmic manipulations, exponential manipulations, conditional probability manipulation) followed by exercises to practice them. This is a stark contrast to my University Experience, where mathematics is about principles, logic and the demonstrations that underly theorems and their validity (e.g. ''why is the formula for combinations of ""m draws on a set of n"" built this way?''): deep study of these topics provides students with the mental skills to build a MODEL of whatever they come to face in real life. You may forget the rules, but those can be freshened up by a course like this.

The quiz questions seemed much harder than any of the examples discussed in the videos.  The fourth week covered probability, which is something that I felt like I knew fairly well going into this.  The quality of the lectures in the fourth week is lower.  Too many different formulae are tossed at the audience without a lot of explanation and very few examples are given.  Once again, the quiz questions were way more difficult than the examples used in the lecture.  There are tons of mistakes in the lectures, with a lot of popup boxes added in later on to correct them.  But honestly, there are enough that these lectures should just be rerecorded.  Write out decent scripts, work out the problems in advance, and remove the errors.  I would like to see more discussions about the math itself and how it is applied in data science.

At least some links to fill in the knowledge gaps or relevant subject.The video lectures, although have been very informative and useful, I found a significant difference in how subject have been taught and discussed by both teachers.

I'm a post graduation pursuer in field of data analytics and I was looking to Brush Up my math Skills as you know data science is a multidisciplinary subject with heavy emphasis on math and stat. The course was neatly done right down from technical aspects to content, the video companion sure provided a lot of help. I would like to mention Paul because his enthusiasm and energy was contagious even though it's a video. The only Con I felt was that Bayesian theorem could've been excellent if it had 2 or 3 more different problems that was solved; Granted, that might make the content a little bit longer than a 4-week course but I felt Sets could be little bit trimmed and Bayesian Theorem little more enhanced.

So much math was covered that it is hard to believe it was all done in 4-5 weeks required to complete the course. It was well taught-- very relevant and clear for the most part. I have had all this math in the past so I had a frame of reference but without it I think it would be hard to follow.  Having said that,  I found the Probability lectures hard to follow. It seemed you need to know a lot of probability theory beforehand. Also the videos were too short in this sections and went very fast.  The videos need to be 20-25 minutes with more examples.  The quizzes in this section were the hardest because not many examples were given in the lecture.  Overall though I feel accomplished and feel I can tackle the math that comes my way when I pursue my data science degree.  Thank you for putting together a course with the background math needed for data science. ",0,9,Mahnaz Karim,3649211

Now that I re-learn it, I just fell in love with Math all over again and I understand the concept much better.

Overall I learned a lot from this, but most of the stuff I learned already in Algebra class. For example, one thing that I already learned was the definition of infinite numbers on the number line.One new thing I learned was about sets, which are a way to group numbers efficiently. It makes a big set of data easier to read and process. I also learned from this course is something called sigma notation, which is a way to solve a certain type of equation. If this sounds really technical, don’t worry. Honestly, the course was less about doing math and more about learning how math is related to data science and some basic techniques and definitions.Overall this course surprised me because I thought it was going to be a little boring, but it turned out alright. The only bad thing I would say about it is that Paul Bendich made a quite amount of errors in his lesson, causing Coursera to pause the video and edit it",0,0,Timmy Chen,57429214

I found the Probability lectures hard to follow. It seemed you need to know a lot of probability theory beforehand. Also the videos were too short in this sections and went very fast. The videos need to be longer, with 20-25 minutes and with more examples. The quizzes in this section were the hardest because not many examples were given in the lecture. Overall though I feel accomplished and feel I can tackle the math that comes my way when I pursue my data science degree.

There were a couple of instances where the instructors simply show you how to use a particular equation to deal with a particular kind of problem without explaining why it works. For concepts to really sink in you need to get a deep intuition for how they operate. I think these intuitions were provided for the main concepts, but there were some sub-concepts, where they essentially just gave you the method without getting into how it works. It's fine to know how to use it, but without a deep intuition it's just memorization.Overall I really liked this course though. The quizzes and tests were challenging and fun and I came away with a much better knowledge of the subject matter, especially probability. I'm not a scientist, so I can't really speak to whether this will be all I need, but it was certainly helpful in the data science concepts I'be been exposed to so far.

This course is a particularly good option for individuals who have seen some amount of calculus and algebra but haven't used those methods in a long while and need to review. Thorough, easy-to-understand material.I would suggest to the course facilitators that they develop the provided lecture notes -- already a useful tool -- into a full-fledged text. I'm not suggesting something much longer than what they already have, but simply taking that document and adding a bit more rich content. While the notes are useful for more carefully studying the math being done in the lectures, even a bit of effort putting some pedagogy into the notes and combining them into a single document (which I did for the sake of printing) would create a hugely valuable resource.
