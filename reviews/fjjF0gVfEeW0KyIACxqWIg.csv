My only complaint is that the instructor frequently says oops, sorry, and corrects notation errors as they are entered. For that reason, the videos are unnecessarily long, which is unfortunate.The lectures are highly improvisational in nature, and one must constantly watch the notes and symbols being typed in the videos. While I appreciate this presentation of the thought process, if the lectures were more concise, it would be more helpful and time-saving for the learner. The learner could stop the video to verify where necessary. This course would be more suitable for a regular classroom setting, but for online, perhaps not so much.",0,0,May ,83550567

20289885~COURSE!~fjjF0gVfEeW0KyIACxqWIg,1468936085163,5,0,"This is an excellent course and it really pushes you hard to learn Classical Composition. There are a few problems, however. Minor quibbles: 1) The instructor does not really explain Parallel Perfect Fifths or Octaves; I had to look them up on my own. They deserve a whole lecture. 2) One of the assignment solutions has a Parallel Octave by contrary motion, which is not supposed to be allowed.3) He also neglected to explain the Harmonic Minor Key being used for minor chords in his Lecture 0 of Week 2. Just a very short explanation would have saved me 40 minutes of stressful researching, confusion, and doubts about my own sanity ;) The biggest problem: This course should really be an 8- or 12-week course. The weeks are very densely packed. In Week 2, I worked 3-4 hours every day, and then was greeted by 11 classes due in 7 days when I opened Week 3. The assignments are rated 10 or 20 minutes but actually take about 2 hours. It would often take me thirty minutes to an hour to get through one 5-15 minute video. (I do take detailed notes and do recall and mnemonic drills along the way, however). If you are already solidly grounded in music theory and have much of voice leading on autopilot, this class is faster. That said, I would not want him to cut out anything. Every class so far has been necessary. It has taken me from almost 0 musical theory understanding to feeling very comfortable with advanced concepts, all in an extremely short time.If you try to complete all of his video examples just before he does them, they work like a charm. I came here to get solid skills, and Just three weeks in I feel like I have made a years' worth of progress. I highly recommend this course, but know the kind of work you are getting into.
