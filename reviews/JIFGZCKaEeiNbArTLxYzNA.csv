4793181~COURSE!~JIFGZCKaEeiNbArTLxYzNA,1660215160379,2,0,"Week 1 was pretty good. Week 2 was not as advertised, a look at how composers use harmony. Instead it was a repeat of week 1 - showing the overall structure of a piece of music using melodic fragments and because the melodic line was in the bass we are supposed to believe this counts as the use of harmony? It doesn't! Week 3 I didn't complete because it was dedicated to a piece composed by the presenter and did not interest me.",0,0,Alan Williams-Key,4793181
