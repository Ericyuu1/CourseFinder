5265123~COURSE!~CPLPuDKiEeaGtRI0HQleow,1634407333995,3,0,"T​hree and a half stars. It's an interesting overview of a very specific sub-topic within Chinese history--kinship and reproduction. I appreciated the short length and lecture + quiz format of the course, but I found the lecture videos (with the professors more or less reading the slides) a bit distracting, especially when words were mispronounced or mis-read entirely. Also found the focus on ""who we are"" a bit confusing; perhaps it's directed at those of Chinese ancestry? Would be a good course for students with a background in Chinese history or population/reproduction studies, but probably too specialized for general knowledge.",0,0,Jeananne Kim,5265123
