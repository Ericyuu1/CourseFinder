12885340~COURSE!~iBhpoocIEemQgg5vJN-Zig,1595410074865,3,0,The instructor is knowledgable and materials are moderately useful.Notebook with assignment is broken. There are many typos and elements which are not rendered properly. Notebook is huge and every subtask depends on previous state. It takes time to reload all previous tasks if you did not solve everything in one go. Final quiz basically repeats all the questions from previous quiz. Course could use more polish.,0,0,Danijel Temraz,12885340

3441241~COURSE!~iBhpoocIEemQgg5vJN-Zig,1622107433164,5,0,"I​t was a great course except for the 3-hour data cleaning assignment using Jupyter Notebook.  Other Jupyter assignments worked fine, but this was was so extensive that it completely bogged down my (high end) laptop.  After an hour or so every keystroke was slow.  I rebooted and restarted multiple times and I was unable to finish (solely due to the technical challenges).  It took me literally 2 hours to manage to raise by score from 19 to 20 to pass the darn class, struggling to get one more scored point to process and get graded.H​aving said that, the instructor is terrific and I found it very informative (primarily as a refresher after a long career in data management, but I learned a number of things too).  Well worth the time invested (not counting the very fustrating technical difficulties mentioned above).",0,0,Kirke B. Lawton,3441241
