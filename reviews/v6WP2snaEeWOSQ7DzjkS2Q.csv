23008998~COURSE!~v6WP2snaEeWOSQ7DzjkS2Q,1563420466337,1,0,"Extremely disappointed. I don't consider the content is at a level most people looking for enrolling this course would expect. It gets the feeling of science communication videos rather than a professional lectures. The absence of full lectures with specialists on the topic build an unsettling feeling for conceptual mistakes by the instructor, not to mention that it is quite boring. (with the greatest respect)The mechanics the course pretend for you to follow are quite hard to overcome. First of all, the discussion assignments  are build on search in other sources (which is a good thing), but the ""lectures"" come to little to no use. Finally, the quiz content is very confusing. Even if the overall course content is quite basic, it seems that the intention of the quiz is for you to fail.I've taken other courses on the origin and evolution of life and by far, this has so much work to be done to be at a good level.",0,1,David Madrigal Trejo,23008998

Being no expert myself, I couldn't validate the majority of the course content, but when I knew something of the subject the errors were obvious. Placing a middle-aged male before the camera, telling the story as he knows it, without proper fact checking is not a smart thing to do when your students sits all over the world with Goodle on their second screen.The other/secondary speakers were good though!",0,1,Jakob Gidlund,24865442

I really hate that unlike edX, you cannot really do much without purchasing the course. Whenever you resume, it takes you to the orientation quiz that you can't even submit without buying the course (can't even do an orientation quiz for free?). And if you don't pay attention to what you can or cannot do if auditing the course you can do a whole assignment then find out you can't even submit it.

The assignments are not good and why it should be checked by peers and why we should be subjected to write two different essays on same week and check others for no reasons. There is an over emphasis on Carl Woese and his works and less emphasis on other important course materials, the lectures are not that engaging and not good explaination is provided and students are flooded with lectures on Carl Woese and his greatness which I find pretty baffling and time consuming.I expected more from this course but compared to other courses this one is more challenging and intentionally designed to over emphasize Carl Woese and fail students by repeatedly bombarding us by needless written assignments.
