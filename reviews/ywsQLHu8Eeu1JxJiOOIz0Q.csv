23550092~COURSE!~ywsQLHu8Eeu1JxJiOOIz0Q,1621705098680,3,0,"Some good practical skills here. Intended for people with some JS experience who feel comfortable attempting assignments without all the needed functions being explained first. Only has auto-generated subtitles which were useless with the teacher's strong accent, so if you lean on subtitles for comprehension I'd stay away. I learned a few things, but even with an overview of JS from a previous course I was out of my depth, and didn't even know where to start when given the practice assignments.",0,0,Nikolai Humphrey-Blanco,23550092
