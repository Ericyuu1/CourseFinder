5728635~COURSE!~7g2jVkeREeabNQ5k0FBNlQ,1545696197283,1,0,"This course is False and Deceptive Advertising from both coursera and berklee because it lists the level of experience as beginner and ""takes 3-5 hr/week"" of homework.  This is absolutely false and deceptive.  It takes far more experience and more hours of work per week than just ""3-5"". I sent feedback to coursera support about this and they directly admitted that the work was purposely listed that way to attract more students to sign up for the class even though they would not be able to finish properly, /and/ they said they would not change this to reflect the reality of the course.   FALSE ADVERTISING.    If you can get past that, the course content and structure is very good...but it is impossible to accomplish without experience and more anywhere from 10-25 hours per week (no exaggeration) of homework.  25 hours per week means:  1 hr practice per day, 1 hr study per day (that's 14 hrs per week) PLUS about 4-8 hours on average for the weekly project (more, for the final project).",0,6,Jonathan Cline IEEE,5728635
