Only with the discussion forum and extensive online research can you finish the course to the greater part some way or other. Dont give me bs about the quickly evolving nature of ML in Azure. Most errors have nothing to do with that. Just sloppy.Still You get some hands-on experience with ML in Azure and a decent idea of how to train and use models. ",0,0,Ulrich Hofsäss,88496206
