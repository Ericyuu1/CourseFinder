21360399~COURSE!~YweOk-DuEeutMhLqB6BFnw,1664838697450,1,0,"Too bad I had to give this course a one star. T​his course had so much potential. Unfortunately, many of the examples were shown in the coded programming language which made it difficult to understand the concepts. If this problem can be resolved, I would give it  four stars since the material is succinct and thorough wilth a decent amount of examples to illustrate the concepts. ",0,1,Frieda P.

45919704~COURSE!~YweOk-DuEeutMhLqB6BFnw,1642425753719,1,0,"This course has no videos; it is comprised entirely of write-ups of foundational math concepts. These write-ups are done well, without being too bloated, and encompasses all the key concepts. They are also fairly easy to read, and the layout is easy on the eyes. For anyone wanting a review of these math concepts, this is an EXCELLENT course to take a refresher from.HOWEVER, this courses' quizzes are BLOATED with bugs. There are three weekly quizzes that it is impossible to get 100 on, because the answer to the question is submitted incorrectly. Until this is fixed, my rating will remain as is.Otherwise, this is a nice refreshment course and it's obvious significant effort went to creating it.",0,14,Kristen Lee,45919704

111592688~COURSE!~YweOk-DuEeutMhLqB6BFnw,1663423534641,2,0,"T​his course was helpful, but somewhat unclear and riddled with errors, and bad coding. Some of the formulas and example problems show up clear and readable, while many appear in long strings of unformatted coding, so that in order to read it, you need to study the string and slowly pick apart the elements of the problems. It is time consuming and frustrating. Additionally, there are a few instances where this happens in a test, making the questions very difficult to answer. A​lso, many of the test problems are printed so small it is actually difficult to make out what the problem even says. I found using the phone app actually helped a bit on legibility. L​astly, this is an very fast paced overview of many mathmatical concepts. It doesnt dive extremely deep in any explainations. It mostly tells you, 'this' is 'that' and here are 3 examples, then moves on.  It does mostly build on itself, but if you are not super attentive to the samples, you may miss a critical element that was not explained, but is 'somewhat' demonstrated in the sample problems... which are hard to read... so great review if you already have learned these concepts before and just need a refresher. But not good for someone brand new. ",0,2,Amanda Piller,111592688
5005287~COURSE!~YweOk-DuEeutMhLqB6BFnw,1649061422570,3,0,"While I found this course helpful as far as giving a nice review and I was happy with the learning experience as a whole, I was less pleased with the fact that there were so many errors in text and examples (clearly was not proofread) and ran into a few times when I had the correct answer on the quiz (asked others to work the equations/problems to verify) but was marked as incorrect. Seems like if this is for college prep, more attention would have been paid to details like these. ",0,8,Jami Lashbrook,5005287
