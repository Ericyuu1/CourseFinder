He explains very well how equations arise in physical situations, much better than you would find in a textbook. The course is very well structured and the videos are are of a convenient length, about 10 minutes each, so that we are not overloaded with material. I am not an engineer and it is only now that I have an understanding of resonance and realise that it is the amplitude of the vibration that increases with time that causes the breaking of a glass or the destruction of a bridge. Although I scored highly in all the module quizzes I found the course very tough. It is essential to do all the practice questions and the intermediate quizzes along the way. I also found it useful to pause the video and work out derivations either before or after the tutor had done so. The only quibble I have is that the tutor sometimes worked out too much in his head. Now this is fine for someone who is already proficient but is not fine for learners who are meeting the material for the first time. In my experience small little things can often block a learner's progress. In addition to the video material there is also a pdf document of the lectures which contains worked solutions to the problems. Thus is useful for checking your own solutions against.",0,8,Michael O'Loughlin,12432930

I found that writing my own notes on the side helped keep the key facts together as a cheat sheet for quizzes (for my purposes, I do not need to know the material by heart). A small criticism is that the feedback on the quizzes could be more helpful: sometimes, we get lucky with an educated guess, but the only feedback we get is ""correct""; I have followed a class in which correct responses were explained, which helps! Also, the feedback regarding bad answers is minimal and not always helpful. Aside from these two minor aspects regarding quiz feedback, the logical progression throughout the course is quite smooth, and refreshers are included as extra videos for material relied upon during a chapter (e.g. a refresher lecture on matrix calculus, another on partial derivatives, etc.).",0,0,stephane galzin,2688973

The theory is well developed and explained, and then used to solve example problems that cover a wide range of applications.  I didn't think it was possible to learn this much in six weeks, but Professor Chasnov marched through progressively harder material at just the right pace, and I now feel very well prepared to tackle courses where Differential Equations is a prerequisite.  Because Dr. Chasnov doesn't use a traditional text book with long problem sets, doing the ""homework"" was actually fun.  Many times, one well-selected problem is all it takes to prove that you either understand the material, or you need to watch the video again and take better notes.  I'll be taking this instructors other courses, and I'm looking forward to the Numerical Methods course he has in the works in the upcoming months.

I am not an engineer and it is only now that I have an understanding of resonance and realise that it is the amplitude of the vibration that increases with time that causes the breaking of a glass or the destruction of a bridge. Although I scored highly in all the module quizzes I found the course very tough. It is essential to do all the practice questions and the intermediate quizzes along the way. I also found it useful to pause the video and work out derivations either before or after the tutor had done so. The only quibble I have is that the tutor sometimes worked out too much in his head. Now this is fine for someone who is already proficient but is not fine for learners who are meeting the material for the first time.
