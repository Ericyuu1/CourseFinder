The course work is, and I  quote, ""a project with minimal scaffolding. Expect to use the the  discussion forums to gain insights! It’s not cheating to ask others for  opinions or perspectives"". In other words, part of the learning target  is to work through bad or incomplete documentation and to solve an  exercise that is stated without providing the information you need to  solve it. Unless someone else already went through the moves, the  lecturer fully expects you to fail by yourself.

Figuring out what's wrong with your own code is a ""good stress"" because there is something you can do about it.  Figuring out why Runestone is doing something unexpected is a ""bad stress"" because all you can do is paste it into a discussion forum and wait ( often for quite some time ) for a reply which may or may not be helpful.  So here's the thing; it's not always obvious as to when it's the former at play vs the latter or perhaps even both and hence one is left to speculate as to whether or not one is spending hours diligently and happily *learning by doing* or just *Completely Wasting Your <hyphenated expletive> Time*.

We are all watching this on video, so we can always replay something if your explanation doesn't make sense.  It would be more valuable to have more examples than to have you repeat core concepts in multiple lectures.  I basically watch the videos on 1.5x or 1.75x speed to get through these and get to the examples.  The practice exercises are then more valuable.  I also could benefit a little more on clearer guidance on the final project.  I really like the approach of breaking it down, but I do better if I have an understanding of the big picture first, then start to break it down.

However the runestone environment which is what the assignment and project is done in a while getting used to as it is a broswer programming environment not a local machine program like IDLE.A damn good course with manageable assignments.

If getting the Specialization Certificate is very important to you, there are resources online that you can leverage to complete the project but that is done largely at the expense of any real learning, so I really hope UofM comes up with an alternative final project that is more consistent with the level of expertise attained in courses 1-5 (maybe something on implementing classic algorithms?).
