80708638~COURSE!~xpRQ986gEeu0KQ5V9fFcUQ,1630457554604,3,0,Compared to other coourses Ive taken thru Coursera including the 1st course in the Abnormal Psychology Specialization; I found this Professsor to be hard to understand and confusing. The subject matter was interesting but I felt it could have been presented in a more organized and concise manner. Was actuelly relieved when I finished because couldn't listen to this lecturer any longer; I'm not a novice at attending lectures either - I'm an MD.,0,1,Mary Ann Echelberger-Beasley,80708638
