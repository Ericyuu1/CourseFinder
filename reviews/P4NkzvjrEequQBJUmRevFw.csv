55234250~COURSE!~P4NkzvjrEequQBJUmRevFw,1621277181756,2,0,"Course content was well curated, however, the peer grading took much longer than any other course I've taken on Coursera leaving me with open courses that charged me more money instead of acknowledging the work had been completed and letting me complete the course. Just exists to make money, do not take this course if you have a deadline or a budget, expect to not get a peer graded review or grade for several days or weeks. Without that grade, you cannot complete the course, let alone the certificate.",0,0,Anna ten Bensel,55234250
