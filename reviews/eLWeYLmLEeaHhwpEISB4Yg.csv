435835~COURSE!~eLWeYLmLEeaHhwpEISB4Yg,1544311113970,2,0,"The course itself is excellent, with good lectures, informative links, and with a cleverly-designed final project. If you're just auditing the course, you'll learn a lot. I really really wish I could give it five stars.But. If you're considering paying for this course, think carefully. The use of peer grading is a SIGNIFICANT detriment to the value of this course, more so than the others in this series. The grading rubric is poorly designed, and the rubric for the last question doesn't even match the question, making the assignment hard to grade. As a result, grading is all over the map, and it seems a lot of people have to submit multiple times. Moreover: The forums are full of people begging for peer reviews, some of them for weeks. A significant number of the entries I was presented for grading contained plagiarized material (you don't get review credit for flagging those). Despite being a paid-for course, nobody appears to be responsible for making sure assignments get graded at all, let alone fairly. Nobody monitors the forums to answer student questions. If you go to the Help section to see what to do if you've submitted your project, done the required peer reviews, and still have no grade weeks later after even resetting your deadlines, the official guidance is: beg on the forums. Take that into consideration when deciding whether to pay for this course.",0,4,John Murphy,435835
29380135~COURSE!~eLWeYLmLEeaHhwpEISB4Yg,1516493221490,3,0,This course needs better explanation and a little better prep for the final assignment with a more comprehensive material to prepare people within the course on how to pen test and how to do the assignment with an example.

The lessons are easy enough to understand, even with minimal computer literacy, thanks to the Instructor's (Mr. Greg Williams) outstanding work, but the real deal comes when it's time to submit an assignment to pass the final test. It was tough (to me): but really I would do it all again. The only dark spot is represented by a less-than-active class, which could lead to up to 14 days to receive a grade (and realize that you have failed the test). Four star to the structure then, but five stars to Greg!",0,0,FRANCESCO FAZIO,68416335
