83476018~COURSE!~ALiQvdo8EeqUWApFbhko2w,1618924745185,1,0,"This class was a rip-off, I knew more going into it and the examples in the environment didn't work even though the course was marked as new. The course also had a no-refund policy which is total BS. And after speaking with Coursera reps they still refused the refund even after I explained that from the beginning the course materials were out of date and I was unable to complete the examples. I had to pass the test just to get to the point where I could rate this course one star (I wanted to rate it zero stars, but it wouldn't let me do that either). I would be very careful when taking Coursera courses and read the refund policy ASAP. Also look for comments which in my case were limited as it was a new course. I will never take another Coursera course or recommend to a colleague because of this.",0,3,William Helmke,83476018

Personally I think calling this a project is not fair because the details like choosing the specific instance and image in the EC2 and other many stuff were not explaned, rather a very general approach.",0,0,Murat Bayraktar,89909980
