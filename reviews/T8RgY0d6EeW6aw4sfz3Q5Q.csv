Thousands of certificates have been offerred to cheating students, so don't expect this certificate to be worth something in the job market.

People who already know about Arduino, Raspberry Pi, networking in some level... and with some programming background will find this specialization unworthy IMO.On the other hand, the teacher explains everything in a very easy to understand fashion giving the sufficient information for students to know how to manage the assignments, and with three hours a day the whole specialization could be completed within two weeks EASILY.Maybe it is only me who expected this introduction to be focused on engineering students and graduates, but knowing this you should be the one to make the decision of subscribing or not to this course.",0,3,Eric Ciurana Marín,6528688

The instructor talks with details and clarity without overwhelming the beginners, sometimes too much of information won't help but could be detrimental .

Also teaches the importance of having a requirement specification followed by system design and testing which are key for the success of any project.  A simple project with few components is easy to implement but a project with more interdependent components especially if it involved motion that requires fabrication, mechanical and electrical or complex to implement. I wish I had time and support to really see my SmartCar project implemented.
