But on a superficial level. Also, it might be suitable for the ones who want a ""self-help"" content. The lectures are nice and instructive. There are somethings I do not like that made me un-enroll:First of all,  I know by the title the course is to help you to find a life purpose. However, I thought the course would also help you assist those that do not have a purpose, are lost, fragile, and do not know where to start. Somehow helping guide people that are in a hard situation and that would not be suitable to watch a ""self-help"" lecture. As it is a certified course ... It does not do that. And I believe that some people who enroll in searching for self-help might not get the help they expect as it does not address topics related to specifically insecurities.Second of all, the first survey asked questions as ZIP code and information that make me feel uncomfortable. It felt for me it was a product research (commercial) rater a survey to understand the profile of learners engage the course as other Coursera courses does. Finally, the instructor spends too much time promoting his own app. To conclude, I don't think is a course that you should purchase a certificate or apply for thinking about developing on your job/career.

I think Noetic Science is a field of immense potential and power, and I hope your course can be included in this discipline as well.  What was missing a bit for me was more information and help uncovering or detailing one's personal purpose and life meaning.  I do think that most people enrolling in the course do so because that is their primary interest.  I am an Occupational Therapist, and a core philosophy of our service model is providing interventions that support the client's own purpose and life meaning.   So, I am not a stranger (nor an expert, by any means), to this topic.  But, I've often wondered how I could makes assessing this (for my clients, but also for myself) clearer.  A few ideas that just came to mind might be using standardized (or not standardized) personal values assessments, personality assessments,  self reflection and mindfulness activities, and include some assistance in interpreting these in terms of life value and meaning.  Another method might be to look at what stimulates the VMPFC, or other activities that are highly correlated with VMPFC activation.  Examining one's purpose and life meaning while ensuring the VMPFC is activated might generate more authentic findings.  I hope this helps, and thank you for the innovation and creativity it took to bring this course to fruition.
