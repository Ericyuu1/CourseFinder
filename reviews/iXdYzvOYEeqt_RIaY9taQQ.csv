Some parts are intuitive and well paced, while others are difficult for a person without programming experience. I expected better from a course with IBM's name on it.In this last module, I completed some Jupyter exercises and when I took the test for the section I had to return to the  Jupyter lab project and add in more code to answer additional questions. Just have me do those  exercises in the first place, then I can answer all the questions and it won't waste my time going back and forth. The IBM software ran out of processing time on the trial when I was busy with the Python exercises, then you have to wait a full month for it to reset so I ended up having to use Jupyter running on my computer to finish before the module was due.I learned a lot of useul skills and content was great, but I think there are things that could be done to make it a more smooth and enjoyable experience.",0,2,Dale Wilson,78817155
75772978~COURSE!~iXdYzvOYEeqt_RIaY9taQQ,1650992881668,3,0,"First five weeks are great, a good hands-on exercise on everything except the process of researching (since we're handed all necessary data in links throughout the course), which is often outside our purview anyway. One notable exception is the process of saving CSV and XLSX files in the week 1 labs on APIs and webscraping (the Github job and salary data we need to use in the final Powerpoint). A tutorial lab or section DESPERATELY needs to be added teaching us how to access these files after saving them -- the process involves setting up project access tokens and a cloud storage object, then importing a special IBM cloud library allowing one to save the files as accessible data assets, but this information is difficult to find online. It should really be laid out in a lab, both for the final project and to let us test the files we made at the time we make them.Week 6, the Powerpoint, isn't great. There's been a lot of technical education on the processes of data cleaning and everything of that nature across these nine courses, but very little in terms of what conclusions one might draw from this data. I think the certificate could use a course on this sort of actual analysis featuring examples of some of the conclusions we might draw from other datasets, or even a couple freebies at the start of this project just to point people in the right direction. When it came to coming up with innovative ideas about the data, I found myself coming up with a bunch and wondering if they were ""innovative"" enough; like whether simply laying out the rankings on a particular bar chart was sufficient for a ""finding"" point, or whether future predictions about rankings were sufficient for an implication. Grade-wise I did fine, I just think a bit of practice earlier would help us not be stumbling around so much on the final presentation.",0,2,Robert Stemmler,75772978
