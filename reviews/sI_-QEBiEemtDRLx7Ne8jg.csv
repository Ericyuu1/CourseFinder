 The coding assignment felt a little bit short in quantity of lines of 
code required. Nevertheless, I felt they captured the relevant concepts.
 In the quizzes, if you get something wrong, a good explanation is 
usually provided. The staff is also quite active in the forum (at least 
on the threads I looked for). A final mention to the fact the the 
materials are updated, including clarifications or errata. Quite good to
 know that there is care in improving the materials rather than just put
 the first version in Coursera and never touch it again.",0,1,Filipe Direito,11398452
