75316206~COURSE!~SqmLPbZREeaqPQ5tUH5EoA,1612339142324,1,0,"I really want to believe that the lecturer has an in depth knowledge of the topic but as many others pointed out before: The course is providing no practical content at all and from an international academic researcher with multiple years working experience in native English speaking countries I would expect a clear and understandable communication. This was unfortunately not the case. It was very hard to follow the lectures that are ""purely read from the slides"". Quizzes became indeed hard because of a certain language barriers. Terminologies of teaching (e.g. ""In this course you learned [...]"" or ""In the past course you studied [...]"") are a bit misleading into the perception of an applicable understanding of the concepts. But knowledge does not equal understanding. To have ""studied"" or ""learned"" a topic one needs to get lectures that are didactically formulated well and maybe provide hands-on experience with the topic. At least giving a small assignment and trying around with QGIS would have provided some value.I also agree with others that this course should be updated and rerecorded with a speaker that is more comfortable with spoken English.
