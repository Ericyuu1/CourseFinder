There was definitely more good than bad, but I struggled a bit with the math as there were not enough applicable examples prior to complete the case studies with certainty. I could not repeat the scenarios with real life situations with confidence. Maybe slow down to fully explain formula concepts and technical frameworks better and provide more examples to practice getting it right before the graded assignments. ",0,1,April Dinius,85417471

29901766~COURSE!~Cil8XPTgEeSlpiIAC7NwBA,1514890106414,3,0,"I'm new to Business Studies - so maybe this is normal - but I was surprised at the amount of jargon in this course. It seemed that every simple idea came with another set of acronyms or obscure terms to remember, which made learning more, rather than less, difficult. If I were being cynical, I would think this tendency to over-complicate things were borne from an urge to add a veneer of legitimacy to a subject sometimes judged to be a ""soft science"". This is unfortunate, as the key ideas in the course were very helpful to me, and I imagine they will be helpful to others too.
