122171289~COURSE!~sc2g2Ze1Eeu46w60Xgbpdw,1676374393429,1,0,"The accuracy and correctness of course materials is crucial for effective learning. With the constantly changing variables and information in various fields of study, it is essential for course materials to be updated and reviewed regularly. However, some course materials may contain outdated information or incorrect details, which can lead to confusion and hinder the learning process.One of the common issues that arise from incorrect course materials is the changing of variables' names. When variable names are changed, it can be confusing for students to understand and apply the correct concepts. This issue can lead to mistakes in assignments and exams, which can ultimately impact students' grades and overall academic performance.It is essential for educators to ensure that their course materials are updated and accurate, especially when it comes to variables' names. Inaccurate information can create confusion and cause students to waste time trying to understand the material, resulting in a negative impact on their overall learning experience.

23761863~COURSE!~sc2g2Ze1Eeu46w60Xgbpdw,1642753592352,2,0,"Please be prepared to retry multiple times. For the hands-on exercises the instructions seems to have issues. I had to try multiple times, correct the instructions and then try on the Azure Machine learning studio. I have given feedback for each of the page. Hope someone is reviewing and correcting them. It is so amazing that so many errors are in the instructions of this course. I ended up finding the github repository and taking the working code from there. Please do this course only if you have the patience to be put up with an irresponsible course creator who didn't really proof read anything!! No testing also done!!In any cases it may be good that we have some challenges and need to retry and rectify and try these exercises. Azure Machine learning is definitely a great step towards making ML solutions somewhat easy to at least prototype and test. Haven't tried in production to comment. ",0,2,Joseph Sha  Eapen,23761863
