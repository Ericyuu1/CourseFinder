It also looked tempting because it offered the option to take the practicum; however, when it's being offered at $1,000, I expect this class to be worth the cost. It's not. The first quiz is ridiculously hard (it took me three or four days to pass it), then you get to module 3 and the quizzes are way too easy. There is very little content, and a lot of contrived scenarios with foreign teachers (there is no effort to pretend they're overseas, as the dialogues basically repeat what's already been introduced except for one or two instances where we get additional information that's useful, but the backdrops are clearly fake). The whole thing with Brandon isn't informative (it could be any person), and the clips from the voxy are basically all the same thing. I really do not recommend this class if you're looking for something substantial; there's just very little worthwhile information. If this is an indication of the quality of the vox, then the voxy is very poor and not worth it unless it were free which it isn't - and the price for an  educational experience that looks like this class is just not worth it.",0,1,Vanessa Raney,46512297

I've had enough poor quality teacher / prof. role models, seen enough of them in film & theater, I don't need more of that.  It totally takes away from the learning enjoyment about that, wastes time instead of presenting more interesting information about it all.  There is a lot more room for a good academic presentation of all of that.  It's too much clowing around instead of teaching us real useful information.  That time machine is a waste of time, the year in bold letters once is enough.  Do not make use of biblical themes since that is mocking the Bible and God in this way.  If one does that without understanding this, it releases the 2nd heaven demomic energies onto the earth since the spiritual is alive & active which is very danergous.   That is very poorly done.   The way he presents angels as weak with an indication of being gay is totally unacceptable.  Angels are messangers of God who deliver very clear messanges.  They are immensely powerful and can kill those who disoby God.   I highly recommend to re-do this class as fast as possible.  That film credit at the end is a waste of time and annoying.

Is this a new concept or the same one previously mentioned?Finally, the course discusses pros and cons of various teaching approaches. To do this a ""devil"" and ""angel"" character is used. I found this to inappropriate as there may be many who do not understand this reference due it being a western cultural concept as well as a religious one. The characters also go on tangents and behave in a cartoon-like fashion. It can be somewhat distracting.A better way to present this characters would be to have a Mr. Yes and a Mr. No. It is culturally and religiously neutral.

Shane really commits to his roles as observer, exponent, devil and angel, and the silly costumes and voices actually make remembering and distinguishing the various methods a lot easier. It also reminds us as teachers not to be afraid of looking foolish (wink, wink). There were a couple of issues with the subtitles and dialogue. First, every time Shane said ""affective"" the subtitles would say ""effective"" which could certainly confuse people. Second, it was apparent a couple of times that he or Jessica would say the wrong word and it would contradict the message. I can't remember specific examples, but it happened more than once. Finally, some of the jargon was not always clear. They keep saying that the purpose of the Comprehension method was to ""make input comprehensible"".

When we review other learner's assignments it is not easy to choose between YES and NO for completing the task. As an experienced ESL practitioner I would say that if a person has written a whole big chunk where the responses to the two prompts are not separate and where only a few relevant points appear (in bits and pieces) they should not be considered to have completed the task.Some learners have responded to the 'difference between approaches' prompt purely in the form of personal opinion (albeit valid opinions, very often). Others have actually responded based on the contents of that week.I understand that there is quite a range of English language levels among the people who take the course and written answers are not something that even native speakers are always good at. However, I am talking about task achievement rather than grammar and spelling. I would suggest that when marking peers for completing the task it would help if there is a range (say Yes / No / Partially) rather than just Yes or No.Thoroughly enjoyed the course.

I never thought American teachers could be so humorous as I have some bad experience with an American teacher when I was young.  When I started my Form 1 secondary education at the age of 13,  an American male teacher marched into our classroom and ordered us to have an English name each. He said that our Chinese names sounded silly to him and they were difficult to pronoun. I said to him as I came from a village and my mother was illiterate, could he recommend a name. He said that he didn't care, i could call myself Barbara, Mary, anything I like. I felt so insulted and that put me off from learning English for a long time.  I guess he was using Direct approach at that time because he did not speak Chinese, and none of the students understood English then. We did not understand what he said throughout the whole year. I am proud of the name my father gave me and I still only use my Chinese name.        ",0,4,Manyee Wan,1981620
