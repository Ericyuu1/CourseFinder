The information just kept repeating itself, this could have been a shorter course I think. 
I will agree with other comments - the peer-graded assignments in general on Coursera I find silly because some people just downgrade you on purpose? In this course, some assignments made no sense when it came to 'Instructions ' vs. 'Submission ' - that should really be corrected!

Let me start with my appreciation for thorough teaching and explanatory practices when relaying information to a body of individuals for the purpose of educating them. That being said. This course #4 was dragged out ENTIRELY too long. While I understand that research is a huge vital part of the UX process, this seemed a BIT MUCH. Especially the parts where we have to do the same things voer and over different ways. I think there should be a separate practice modules for each task. So that if someone is not catching on to the content, they can review as much as they want and come back.

My final assignment for this class was submitted 5 days before it was due, they recommend at least 2 days early to allow time for grading, but it wasn't fully graded until 6 days later. Almost a full week went by before it was finally graded. My subscription to Coursera is monthly so I can't move on to turn in my new course assignments until my last course is completed fully which slows me down. I am already not a huge fan of peer-graded anything as most people don't actually give you a proper grade. A lot of people will either not read all the way through what you have submitted and mark you down for missing things that were there they just didn't bother to look for. Or they go the other way and they will grade it well in the hopes you do the same for them. Peer-graded work is just extremely flawed and it should at the very least have moderators to help out when people have been waiting on grades for almost a week, but also so we really can learn and improve our work. It's hard to feel like you are getting graded correctly when people are just wanting to go by a 'you scratch my back I'll scratch yours' moto. 

I do understand that some of this stuff is hard to grade with the way the courses are set up. I do not, however, think that we should have our completion time counted against us simply because our peers haven't graded it yet.

Most of this portion of the course is focused on public speaking and building your resume.  I took public speaking at University because I grew up as a performer and loved being in the spotlight.

While much of this course is boring and difficult to push yourself through, keep in mind that it will get more fun in the next section and you will simply have to do it to progress.  

My only big complaint in these Google courses is Google's bizarre and unwarranted obsession with non-binary people being used in almost every single example given to us students.  I am a proud member of the LGBTQIA+ community, AND I minored in english and creative writing while at University.  Non-binary people are just as awesome as the rest of us, HOWEVER, my complaint is that the people in these scenarios are made-up and there is no reason to use They/Them in every quiz question.  These pronouns are a real part of the LGBTQIA+ community, BUT when someone is learning something new the examples, quiz questions, and answers presented should be straight forward, and simple to understand.  There are moments where the literature will state three peoples names and then pose a question about one of the people referring to that one person as They or Them.  AGAIN, this is fine in real life, but when you have to power to formulate your quiz questions you have to be mindful of the USER'S EXPERIENCE (go figure) and use proper english.  They and Them mostly refer to groups or are pluralisations of some kind.  I am new to what is being discussed and I did NOT appreciate having to guess about what was being asked of me to answer or what was being said about someone in the text.  Join the rest of us in the real world and start using language as it's intended.  AGAIN, I am in that community, I get it when someone doesn't want to identify, but that is a rare instance and does NOT need to be the formula for EVERY scenario presented to the students when the students are attempting to learn something new.

Reading the discussion boards I found that there are quite a few confused students.

I noticed a few that gave instructions to copy a share link from a Google Doc/Sheet, but then the submission page said to upload a PDF and only had an upload option with no place to paste a link. The last assignment also seemed to confuse a lot of people, as I think it was requesting an updated research presentation, but quite a few people seemed to submit the presentation that was put together earlier in Week 4 of the course. I was also confused about this at first, so it may be worth updating the description of the assignment to make it more clear. For example, the last assignment I think is the only one where there is not a specific template despite needing to add new/different material and no exemplar to help understand what the final product should look like.

I learned a ton from this.This course took me 12 days of study to complete with an average of 2h per day (over 20 calendar days). I was able to breeze through the videos (using 1.25x speed) and the readings and quizzes in a fraction of the estimated time but the weekly assignments were time consuming! I regularly exceeded the weekly assignment estimated time of 60m. Here is the actual time I spent working on weekly assignments: 1. build a research plan (25m); 2. conduct a usability study (3h8m); 3. observations into insights and affinity diagram (2h40m); 4. update your prototype and research presentation (2h50m). Conducting the usability study took up the most time because it required emailing friends and family and recruiting them to send a screen capture video of them interacting with the prototype. I'm posting this review to help other students get a better gauge of how much time the weekly assignments will take. Don't be intimidated! Just get started and you'll find it's not that difficult to complete, just time-consuming. I found some parts of this course unhelpful and redundant (i.e., tips for creating a strong presentation, presentation tips, overcome stage fright, tips for giving an effective presentation, etc.). I think it would've sufficed to consolidate all the public speaking tips into one reading and point students to extra resources.

The only part I was confused about was when some random person failed me for an assignment but gave no insight as to why, while another student gave me a passing grade. I hope Google would add a feature that if someone tries to fail you, without justification, that they have to put a reason somewhere, such as this student is missing multiple factors and I had to fail them.
