59904315~COURSE!~Lka_AUNqEeSEgyIAC1AP1w,1592239182854,3,0,"It was a good course.  There were a couple of mistakes in the text and also between the text and quiz.  The last two I remember are in Lesson 5 the presenter from Japan stated for DMAT. ""Actually
I participated in the medical care for the Great East Japan Earthquake as a
member of the Japanese DMAT, Disaster Management Assistance Team which is quite
different from the American DMAT."" The problem was in the quiz that was not an option, it did have ""Disaster Medical Assistance Team"", which of course is the correct answer and was in his slide.  Another was in Lesson 6 where Michael states, ""Third,
the triage person will check how fast the victim is breathing. If over 30
breaths per minute and they may not need to count, if it's fast, they will
know. They will tag the victim as red. If it's less than 30, they will check
perfusion, or blood flow."" Of course, when he goes and states ""If it's less than 30."" he's actually talking about Stage Four and not three.  It was in the slides and any new students would be wise to save the slides to refer to for any quizzes, the text can be tricky.  The only other piece was the assignment, if going to be reviewed by other students, it should have something showing if they left a response or not.  I spent a good 20 minutes looking for their responses (there weren't any).  As stated I liked the course otherwise, Lesson 6 was good to understand how the Triage system works that I didn't know about. Cheers.
