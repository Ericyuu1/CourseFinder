Namely, the part of 2-D array indexed by subsets.

Perfect order of material with gradual increase of complexity(not something I find extremely often). Professor avoided a lot of very boring details(which is very convenient) and on the other hand provided really useful hints and full-blown proofs for algorithms discussed in the course. The problem sets and the programming assignments turned out to be of moderate complexity to pretty challenging. However it exposes underestimates in expected amount of time that to be taken by PS/PA. Whatever it is, but it's rarely took me 30 minutes as stated(often more).Unfortunately neither parts 5, 6... of the specialization exist nor the professor is the instructor in any other course on Coursera.

And I often found I need extra practices (on-line alg interview problems) and reading (CLRS, e.g.) to grasp the course materials. The programming assignments are also more demanding. However, after finishing this course, I believe I have achieved better and deeper understanding of Algorithm design and analysis than I could imaged before taking this final NP course. And I am looking forward to learn more from Professor Tim Roughguarden's 'a second course on Algorithm' on youtube.  Thank you very much, professor! Your knowledge and passion is totally incredible!
