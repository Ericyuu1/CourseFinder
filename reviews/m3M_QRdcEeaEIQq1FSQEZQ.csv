I have signed up for the next course already.My suggestion is regarding the videos.  Firstly, it would be much appreciated if the readers could pronounce their words more clearly.  I find it difficult to understand what they are saying because they tend to mispronounce words, mix up the R's and L's, pronounce the past tense of many verbs in a strange way.  They also tend to miss parts of long words by skipping parts of them when reading.Without the help of the written part accompanying each video it would be quite a challenge to grasp what is being taught in the videos.  Are the texts translated directly from Chinese textbooks?  Please do not translate them word for word, because each language has its distinctive character.  Sometimes the expressions sounded quite strange.Thank you very much for offering this course to students who are able to learn more about Chinese medicine.
