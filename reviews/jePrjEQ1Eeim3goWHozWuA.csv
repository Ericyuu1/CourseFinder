This specialization in general and the last course, ""Culminating Project in Health Informatics"", in specific are using the ""peer-grade""  method, which in theory is great. Still, it is not practical, so learners had to wait and bag in a shameful way for other learners to evaluate their work.
Some ""waiting to be reviewed"" are over two years old. ",0,0,Levin Y,109082616

I am begrudgingly giving the class a single star as the individual who reviewed my assignment did so inaccurately and I am not sure how to protest this. If I can be satisfied, then my review may very well change. I am stymied that there is no easy method to question an individual's review. The following are comments sent to my reviewer. I would appreciate instructions how I can remediate this situation.1. As per instructions, ""PROMPTPlease upload your detailed flowchart as a file attachment."" The rubric, "" Learner created a detailed flowchart (NOT a high-level flowchart).Example of high level flowchart below:MAKES NO SENSE!2. ""The flowchart is an accurate reflection of the actual process."" In what way is my flow-chart NOT an accurate reflection of the process?3. ""Abbreviations were explained before they were used in the chart."" This WAS NOT a criteria in the posted instructions - see details noted below. What kind of ""TIE"" is this??9. The flowchart uses three or more decision nodes. The flowchart uses three (3) decision nodes noted in yellow. (1) ""Is the Proposal approved...""; (2) ""Is the Proposal recommended...""; (3) ""Does TAC approve..."".10. The flowchart uses a decision node for something that was not a decision.
