88546110~COURSE!~S-l9PNzREeqrMw51CmTP5w,1647551745554,2,0,"The instructor has a different definition of ""beginner"" than I. Not sure how I passed the Google Data Analytics course, and UC Davis ""SQL for Data Science"" course, and yet got completely stumped in this course.   It was easy up until the last 2 tasks: Stored Functions and Stored Procedures. She used functions that I have never heard of,  with no explanation at all. I don't mean the function she was teaching either. For example, in 4 lines of code, there were 4 functions used that I have never used before, in addition to the function we were learning. It was a PC LOAD LETTER moment.I'm just learning, but it makes it difficult to learn when the instructor refers to a function, by name, and then types it in differently. I made a 100 on the Final, before I even watched any of the videos.",0,0,Timothy Thompson,88546110
