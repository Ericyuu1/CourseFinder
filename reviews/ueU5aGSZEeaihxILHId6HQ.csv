It could led to more specific goals that forces to cover more of the material/techniques learned 2. Third course, organizational design, is barely covered here, 3. If this is a professional oriented outcome, it does not have to be so much focused on academic format as it is, I think that is overloaded with formalism that does not contribute to the learning outcome. 4. an most important, peers submissions are plague with plagiarized reports (I have found at least 10 duplicated submissions) that does not care in at least changing their names, this is a shame.
