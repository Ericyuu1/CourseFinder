106725895~COURSE!~mehgPKAdEeqNpQpCmwhgnQ,1657785304921,3,0,"Comprehensive introduction to Digital Health.  Mostly based on self-study of academic papers, many 10+ years old, as well as recorded video interviews. Interesting case studies from around the world, both developed and low and middle income countries. For on-the-job usage the course could be (much) shorter and more practically oriented.",0,0,Anders Aarup Poulsen,106725895
94323712~COURSE!~mehgPKAdEeqNpQpCmwhgnQ,1642562976972,3,0,"I work in digital health, so maybe this course wasn't the best fit for me.  I had hoped to learn more about specific digital health tools to potentially add to our program.  To some extent it did that, but I could do without research papers that just confirm that something does or doesn't work.  Also many of the use cases that highlight uses in 3rd world countries seem to focused on public health rather than the actual digital health technologies.  My main issue is how dated some of the articles are.  One was called ""The State of Telehealth"" and dated 2016.  Even without the pandemic, telehealth has come a long way in the past five years; and that progress should be highlighted.  Another was about social media, from 2013...",0,0,Chris Raff,94323712
