There is no progressive (computational) practice. The major flaws of this course are: 1)no handouts of the slides provided, 2) reference to papers are not clickable URL's, 3) PyMKS runs in Python 2.7 (not 3.4) with many modules deprecated. Running this PyMks is therefore not easy at all and bugged with the environments. Once you get in the course is just about replicating some logic without going in-depth of the potential of this tool. As well , what are more up to date tools to be used? 5) instructors are not really good at teaching , 6) there is no active learners community at this period (november 2019)",0,0,CEDRIC THIRY,44513765
