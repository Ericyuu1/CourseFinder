You don't even hear a piece of music until the fourth week, the first three being taken up with explaining octaves, notes, etc.. I was not looking to read music only listen to it.The fourth week turned into something of a travelogue, showing pictures of places, discussing histories of cities. It was also at this point that I noticed a number of spelling and grammatical mistakes in the transcripts under the videos. Dr. Wright appears to be an extremely intelligence, learned man. However, his speaking style did not draw me in at all.

""Let's go super deep on three compositions of one composer, and then oh also here are some other things that were happening at this time."" I was hoping we'd engage with a lot of different composers to understand how music changed over time, but it seemed rather slapdash in its approach. The assessments are my biggest gripe - none of them helped me learn the content any better, and some were downright frustrating because of their complexity and/or irrelevant content.The professor isn't terribly engaging either, so I ended up moving through the videos pretty quickly except to listen to the music.

It is full of unnuanced generalizations, clichés and oversimplifications. Paired with dr. Wright's slow manner of speech and his blatant repetition of key words, I felt like I was in elementary school again! The details are also not always accurate. For example, in the part about Handel, dr Wright says that his operas are about classical history and myth. In fact, more than a third have settings in the middle ages. I could accept this as a generalization, albeit a large and unnecessary one. But he also says that the title character from the opera Rinaldo is some figure of classical mythology, which is factually wrong. In the context of the video it was not important at all. Yet if it's deliberate, it is in my opinion highly inappropiate to 'change' facts to fit your generalization. And if it's accidental, it's sloppy. In either case, it seems below the standard of Yale.And that was not the only inaccuracy, but I won't make this review any longer.In short, my problems with this course are probably due to my wrong expectations.

But I learned much more than that: I learned that I need to listen, not just hear, the music. And then I learned how to listen. I have loved classical music all my life, and I am an accomplished pianist. But I will from now on listen much more intelligently, and my listening will be even more rewarding.However, I had some problems enjoying this course. The quizzes were really squirrely. Some of them asked trivial questions (in what order did Bach visit cities in Germany), some were irrelevant (in what order do sound waves reach the brain), and some asked questions that weren't covered in the video lectures. Professor Wright didn't always explain terms, and this would be a problem for someone who didn't know much about music. Some of the lectures didn't contribute much to the course. I didn't care for the video with the classical guitarist (Solomon Someone). I enjoyed hearing him play and explain one of my favorite Spanish guitar pieces, but the lengthy discussion about how he hurt his hand should have been edited out. In fact, the video seemed to be an advertisement for the guitarist. I didn't care much for Craig's performances. When he demonstrated points by playing, I was stunned at his tempi, and his performance of the Chopin Nocturne was mechanical, lacking nuance. Finally, I think it's tacky for a professor to require his/her own book for a course. It's a fine way to sell one's book. I did buy one of his books and didn't care for it at all.

First three weeks gives an overview of music theory, the rest of the course reviews in broad strokes the various periods of the history of music highlighting the advances and changes seen in each. There are attempts made throughout to tie the music history to historical signposts of visual and other art (less so to historical events, to its detriment). I have no special music background and never seriously played an instrument yet found the course fairly easy to follow. My tenuous grasp of music theory (acquired from those first three weeks) did not really limit me although had it been stronger I would have gotten more out of the course. But it was not essential. I think the teaching was a bit uneven - I appreciated the focus and pace (ie not too fast) but I thought some of the videos were plodding and the visuals static and unexciting. I read one of the reviews noting that Professor Wright's style was as if Mr. Rogers was teaching music history. Unfortunately I found this true in his pacing and delivery of information. The course itself fails to ""sing"", it tends to plod. It seems fairly basic and not particularly sophisticated; I would say that it fulfills its role as an introduction to music history for freshmen in college but failed to bring particularly intriguing insight to music that might excite an older student (like me - freshman year was 49 years ago for me). I am sure that Prof Wright can bring far more to the topic than this course would suggest. I was amused to hear him break into very credible Philip Glass (well, I can't play at all so he does far better than I ever could with all the music he plays). And talk about his friendship to John Adams. To sum up however: I enjoyed the course and it will be the basis of further learning - the point to an introduction!",0,0,Edward Bedrick,61538491

In parts it is very good, but with some attention to a number of points it could be excellent.I will list a number of the issues that I would like to see addressed:The professor has a wide and profound knowledge, but speaks somewhat indistinctly. This is far from being helped by the English subtitles - I do not mean the transcription - but the English video subtitles (I am a native British English speaker) which appear to have been done by a deaf, non-musical, computer and hopefully not by a human. If they WERE done by a human, he or she was drunk or had no knowledge or interest in the content of the material. I have tried to contact the people in charge of the subtitles, but with no success. I understand that they are not the same people as those who perform translations. English subtitles for an English spoken course are apparently not handled by the translator volunteers but are so I was told, farmed out to an outside contactor. There are some absurd transcriptions in the subtitles, and it simply isn't possible to send in reports about each of them - Chello, Hayden, Richard (for we should) are just three that come to mind. The course deserves far better, even if Professor Wright's diction and delivery are sometimes problematic. I needed the subtitles, because Professor Wright's delivery is not always comprehensible. Unfortunately I found the English subtitles to be careless, wrong and inconsistent, and occasionally - groaningly funny.I would be happy to consider reviewing the subtitles - but for this would need them as a separate and continuous file, against which the spoken text could be compared. If someone would like me to do this, please contact me at mneugarten@gmail.com2. (for some reason this window does not allow the first point to labelled 1.) - the presenter plays (not always too well, on an appalling synthesizer. Why couldn't a piano be used?

12434338~COURSE!~eV-OTCTuEeWCGRL6mLoB5w,1471262807512,4,0,"I feel Professor Craig Wright offers a comprehensive, varied, accessible and fun overview of a very large subject, starting right at the beginning of musical history and bringing you up to the present day. He uses a wide variety of visual and audio resources including relevant works of art, architecture, artefacts, sketches, quotes from historical documents, surviving musical scores, music recordings, videos of live orchestral performance, music animations, costume, period instruments and interviews with musical colleagues of his who are able to share their expertise. In addition to all this he offers us his own photographs from his pilgrimages to cities such as Vienna, which adds further to the course's personal touch. What comes across throughout Wright's course videos is his immense love of, and desire to share that love of classical music, which for me is a major factor in what makes the course so appealing. I also enjoy his sense of humour and efforts to appeal to a younger generation (Wright is in his 70s). At more than one point in the course he adopts fancy dress to reflect the period he is exploring. A highlight I feel is when the course features a clip from one of his lectures at Yale University where he enrolls some colleagues to enact a scene from Don Giovanni in which Wright plays an angry father, slain by Don Giovanni in a duel. It is a touching (and amusing) example of his good humour and ability to have fun with his students. My only criticism would be his own piano playing which is often rushed and inaccurate, but I feel this is largely due to the time constraints of filming the videos. By his own admission, he realised early on in life that he was not up to the challenge of being a concert pianist - he is primarily a musicologist, not a pianist. Every piece of music touched on in the course is available via the course Spotify playlist (extremely helpful) so there is no difficulty in listening to professional recordings of all the pieces discussed.I would highly recommend this course to anyone seeking a background knowledge of the evolution of musical history.",0,6,Hermione Fricker,12434338

I have now bought his books on music and genius, so that I may continue to enjoy his ""company"" in my life. I am a committed classical music lover, and his insights have helped to expand and deepen my appreciation even further. He made a valiant attempt to cure my innate loathing of modern music (and art), but I'm afraid my feelings remained intractable. The mathematical possibilities of music are infinite within the framework of the traditional (i.e. natural) rules of composition, so smashing those rules to smithereens simply for the sake of ""novelty"" or ""freedom"" seems to me both very childish and very annoying.

It was a privilege to review the Music History of my college and university years under the guidance and instruction of Dr Craig Wright!  Comments·         Dr Craig is an exceptional and superb instructor: Knowledgeable, Talented, Organized, and Personable. I plan to take his, The Nature of Genius course in the near future.·         This really is (should be) a semester long course. Even 12 weeks would allow for a bit more coverage of the material at a somewhat less frenetic pace. Alternatively, perhaps this material might be offered in two parts.·         Points allocated in the Quizzes should be reconfigured. The grading schema is illogical and lacks mathematical precision.·         The single ongoing problem in all the various courses I’ve taken via Coursera is the poor quality of the English language transcripts. Each transcript should be reviewed and edited by a specialist in the field who has a commanding grasp of language(s), grammar, sentence structure, spelling, and so on. This person should also have a good ear for individual words and phrases; many are incorrect. These many errors, vid by vid, make for a subpar component to what is otherwise an excellent offering. And I see this as the most significant weak spot consistently from course to course.·         Transcript functions such as highlighting passages as per the Save Note function is at times problematical; several attempts might be required to capture the desired passage for commands to “stick.” The Delete Notes function is pretty much useless in that it seldom works at all.·         The lack of response to comments and queries continues to diminish the instructional experience as well as acknowledging difficulties and flaws that might be reasonably rectified. ·         One significant negative point that I’m almost reluctant to point out are in regards the many examples played on the piano or electronic keyboard by Dr Wright. Simply playing the notes more or less in order is not sufficient. The excerpts and examples should be played rhythmically and musically—every time. Gah! Suggestions·         Improve the quality of the online segments by giving each video transcript an additional copyedit and polish.·         Again, perhaps the material of this course—recovered and perhaps even fleshed out—might be offered in two parts.

The supplementary lectures and playlists are excellent (the playlists have now formed the backbone of my spotify playlist). I knew the course would cover the full range of Art music from medieval to post-modern but what I didn't suspect was the appreciation it would leave me with for these styles. I can honestly say that I even enjoyed the Atonal music of Shoenberg! (probably on an academic level rather than a tap-my-foot level). 
Prof. Wright's style is terrific. He's like a friendly grandad: willing to embarass himself with references to (not-quite) current artists; happy to dress up in costume and sing (not too well) to opera; play examples of passages on piano (not too well). but this all adds to his charm. 
All-in-all, an excellent course. I'm actually feeling at a bit of a loss now. I have the recommended reading of Prof Wright's book to keep me company but I wish there were more courses on music and theory from him to further my knowledge.

The course also helps you get a comprehensive understanding of the life and personalities of the composers In addition to their music.

As an engineer I can assure this course transcends both technical and professional specializations for it touches our innermost sense of humanity. Not a single minute should account as a waste of time here. Professor Wright is an example of a master to be followed. His ability to teach the complexities of a Bach's fugue, the inspiration of Beethoven's 5th or the sensitivity of Chopin's nocturnes to a layman as myself goes way beyond just a simple informative course. Besides teaching you how to really listen and appreciate good music without being pedantic or dull, he shows many interesting curiosities as just someone who truly loves what he does could do. Mozart's extravagant character, his tiny piano, the places where he lived, all that made me go to places I had dreamed of. Clara Schumman's diary made me angry with our sexist world at the same time Robert made me cry with his Traumerei. Such remarkable experiences make this course a masterpiece.
