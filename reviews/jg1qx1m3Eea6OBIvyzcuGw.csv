One of the worst I have taken on Coursera.T​he good thing about it though is that you should know what you are getting into when you sign up.  I tried to go in with an open mind and judge it on its merits but it had so few that I left feeling that this was just a waste of time.T​he instructors were... bad.  There isn't really any other way to put it.  They were not engaging and they didn't even seem like people that I would like to have a beer with after class.  The lectures were just boring and the lecturers seemed like unlikeable people.T​he course content was not better.  They constantly assume things without providing evidence and treat things that are harshly debated in the academic sphere as settled. They also entirely omit narratives and facts that don't fit their narrative.  T​he projects were terrible.  I felt as though I was a bored HR executive lecturing employees to try to make myself feel better after my boyfriend broke up with me.

The University of Pittsburg is on the ancestral land of the Adena , Hopewell, and Monongahela people.

Most of the statements made in this course don't provide relevant research proving their validity. For example, one of the linked articles in the course mentions that homophobia at workplace decreases productivity, but no link to proof is provided. It would be great to have the link to this research, so that we can, for example, compare the cost of productivity decline caused by homophobia with cost of anti-homophobia training. Without this proof the rest of the course loses its value and the whole existence of this course feels redundant - why should I spend a lot of my resources on getting opinions of random people about this topic if I can get it for free by googling relevant keywords?
