120866596~COURSE!~HkJsxW0yEeWEewoyD2Bc5Q,1674424537607,1,0,"Unfortunately this course had lots of potential but it turns out to have just a lot of flaws. The material presented is so dense that it would have needed a much more detailed discussion: getting data from the web in CVS format, XML, JSON, databases, etc. All these different aspects should have been discussed in much more detail. The second and most important flaw is the fact that virtually all data are out of date, and it is often impossible to follow along with the code, because the data is no longer available. Since the material presented is so much, it would have been useful to follow along, keeping the code for further analysis and for understanding what is actually going on, but that has not been the case, which is very disappointing.Finally, some of the packages, like plyr, are presented so quickly and the code explained sometimes doesn't work as expected. Another example is xlsx, that does not work with MAC and requires some personal google research to fix the issues. I had lots of expectation for this course, as I was curious to understand better data scraping and the link between R and databases, but the course has been a total disappointment. Once I have finished the specialisation, I will have to find some other courses to complement this, which is also extremely disappointing.

Considering that I have three degrees and completed military PME, I've taken many. The content of the course was significantly out of date. If you're going to teach a course in computer science or on a programming language, you should be updating your lectures at least annually. The websites referenced in the lectures here were either missing or they had changed to the point that the ""examples"" that were presented were useless. That means that at best, those lectures were a waste of time. If I wanted to spend hours and hours on the web trying to figure out what you meant to do, then I could have bought a book and taught myself this material. Secondly, some languages (including R) are actively being developed; this means that because the lecture material was so dated, the methods presented were (in some cases) obsolete. From a presentation point of view, the lectures were sub-optimal because the slides themselves were just images. Having to re-type long lines of code where you can easily make ""fat finger"" mistakes isn't helpful; those slides should contain text that can be copied and pasted into either notes or into an R session.

  - variables are named cryptic things like spIns or x, rather than names with meaning (eg, sprays.by.insect), again ""because it's faster to type""  - way too many cases of ""there is more than one way to do it"", which just makes things confusing because the other ways tend not to be equivalent
What I'm most concerned about is that I've seen lots of poorly written code in many different languages: Java, C++, C, Python, Perl, and now R. But I've also seen really well-written code in all the languages *but* R, I have yet to see any code in R that is flexible, maintainable, and clear. Which leads me to think that no such code exists, or it's so rare that it doesn't matter.

These sources include  XML files, mySQL databases, HDF5 files, csv files, txt files with various formats (for example fixed-with files), JSON objects, and web API. However, the course project only involves reading data from several txt files and combining them into a single R dataset. Course topic order: In the first two weeks of the course, a lot of information is glossed over in passing- this information involves reading from the various file formats mentioned above. Week 3 involves subsetting, sorting, reshaping and merging data. Some of this may be review for you if you've taken the R programming course or the ""R Programming Environment"" course in the ""Mastering Software Development in R"" specialization. Week 4 involves string manipulation, regular expressions and working with the Dates. A lot of this is covered in Roger Peng's ebooks ""R Programming for Data Science"" and ""Mastering Software Development in R"" (both are freely available- google them).Assessments: The only assessments in the course are 4 quizzes- each of which involves about 5 short programming exercises- and a final project which only involves topics from weeks 3 and 4 (specifically- subsetting data, sorting data, reshaping data, and working with regular expressions). So you can do the course project without understanding anything covered in weeks 1 and 2 of the course.

In my opinion, most of the time these are stronger and easier to use compared to Pandas, Numpy, etc., from Python. Despite the bad reviews at the top with lots of upvotes, I do think this was a great course overall. People tend to complain and don't assume responsibility to work and find solutions if they don't understand something.

Such as generating MD files from RMD markdown notebooks, so I could mix live code with text. That's how I produced my CodeBook.md. Then I learned that there are a bunch of libraries for pretty-printing tables. I discovered even more about dplyr. And also learned how to return multiple objects from a function. You can really write papers with all these tools in R and getting expertise about knitr and pandoc.Thank you Jeff and team for putting together such a quality course. ",0,0,Alfonso R Reyes,6400132

Pend, Brian D. Caffo and Jeff Leek and my fellow learners for their excellent help in completing the projet to generate Tidy dataset. I would like to name Mr. Luis Sandino for his help and effort in putting a help Guide for this assignment. I follwed it and got the assignment completed. The step by step procedure helped me and other fellow learnerrs to complete the assignment on time.Though this course is over, still we have the doubt on the dimension of the tidy dataset, whether it is 180 by 68 or 180 by 88 as the total number of ""mean' variables considered are varying. Request mentors or TAs to help us arrive at the correct dimension and help us understand the reason behind the same.This course has witnessed the need for support from TAs and mentors. Their help and support was very valuable in understanding the subject.Thanks to Coursera, my Professors, mentors and TAs of this course for their insight, guidance, support and effort.Wishing Coursera and Professors all the best and Success.The SWIRL component for learning the subject is the best and wish SWIRL support for all the heavy courses.
