The course content consisted of both short videos and online readings which were manageable from a time standpoint. I liked the fact the videos were not overly long or wearisome. The instructor is nice gentleman with a likeable sense of humor and presented the videos in a concise and friendly manner.

The instructor is a talented teacher who adds wit and relevance to each lecture.  I have taken other very good online classes in paleontology, earth science and related subjects.  'Extinctions' rates among the best for clarity and focus on the key thematic points.  I gained a good working knowledge of the Big Five mass extinctions and how they may inform needed mitigation and adaptation in the future.  The innovative integration of lectures and reading material is a feature of this course that makes it especially effective for distance learning.  The articles and papers are sequenced with the lectures to provide very relevant insight and detail that supports each lecture.  The combination enhanced my understanding and retention.  I also appreciated the answering the short, four question, peer-graded, essay at the end of Week 5.  It summarized some of the key teaching points and enhanced learning.
