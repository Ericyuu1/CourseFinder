Problematic for me was the free-association-style of lecturing that seemed to bounce around and meander. Eventually, I just followed along with the script, gleaning points of interest. It might also have been helpful, at the end of some of the lessons, to have a list of songs to listen to along with what to listen for. I would have preferred much more linear organization and a more formal style of lecturing, though I realize some will definitely lean toward the conversational style of this course, which is fair.

Yes, Prof Covach knows his stuff but basically what we got here was little more than a reading of text from his book.   I know he explained why the actual music was not included but think he could have done more to provide links and stimulate listening.   I eventually just started reading the transcribed text of the lectures as I did not find looking at Prof Covach's talking head at all stimulating.   Prof Covach did nothing to stimulate discussion in the forums and although I posted a few things there was very little going on in the forums.

However, the lecturer skirts around or hand waves away controversial or difficult subjects, and he's apparently afraid of offending anyone by getting too close to saying ""fuck"" or ""sex"" even in an academic setting. Additionally, this course won't introduce anyone to forgotten and erased artists of the past - women are largely absent from his history of rock, even though Janis Joplin and The Supremes didn't come out of nowhere. The quizzes are also too heavy on the trivia - ""who published what when"" questions rather than critical thinking questions about why or how. ",0,2,Nathalie Lauze,7851680

Sometimes I preferred reading the transcript as opposed to listening to the video but I found that the transcripts were at times very garbled, inaccurate to what was actually being discussed by Professor Covach (names, places, etc.), and need general editing for grammar.

6802179~COURSE!~xOBaY1ibEeS-oiIAC0UN8Q,1461321142784,4,0,It's a great course and so is the book that accompanies it. However the Course and Book titles are not entirely accurate. It should be called 'An American History of Rock'. There is relatively little discussion outside of America and this is only to serve the discussion of American rock. The book in particular would benefit from a section at the end of each chapter or sidebars 'Meanwhile on the other side of the Atlantic'. As music becomes more fragmented in the 70s I imagine this criticism will become more important.Another thought would be if the Course put a play list together in 'Deezer' and 'Spotify'. That would definitely 5-star the courseStill it's a great course and I really enjoyed it. ,0,1,Hugh McElveen,6802179

It is a pity that the course itself only discusses the music, but does not feature the music itself.

I am very happy that Coursera allows us, in countries with difficult access to information and education, to learn and enjoy these types of courses, with Universities and Professors who only inspire. I have come to understand many things from the music I love, and the context and background behind movies and/or series that portrait these times in history.

The only problem I had is that one had to do a lot of hunting on the net and that took a lot of my time.
