Unfortunately, the lecturers seem pretty uncomfortable speaking English. While they do speak quite good English, they seem to be unfamiliar with the language and vocabulary used in their scripts. Furthermore, it is not made clear until you watch the first lecture that this is a course aimed at ESL students. For the reasons stated in this paragraph, I wouldn’t recommend this to ESL students. The presenters come across more like students taking a speaking exam than lecturers.",0,0,Lindsey Olds,14451268
