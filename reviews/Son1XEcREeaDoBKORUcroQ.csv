65932379~COURSE!~Son1XEcREeaDoBKORUcroQ,1594276045222,1,0,"One of the most frustrating online course I've ever taken. With all due respect, answers should be multiple option, it's ridiculous having students guess every single answer because they change the rounding in every question. Sometimes it's really hard to say if error lies in a miscalculation or in rounding. The course itself is great, but if you're interested in getting the certificate with a good grade, you will have to invest a lot of time (not learning but struggling with the answers).",0,1,Carlos Daniel González Silva,65932379

60801940~COURSE!~Son1XEcREeaDoBKORUcroQ,1590593649277,4,0,"While materials prepared are easy to understand and rather simplified, however sometimes the terms used in between lessons are inconsistent but it is still alright. Biggest issue is with the quiz, when to round off and when to keep the actual values. Since excel is used, rounding off would mean using round(). However the instructions given tend to be stated like this, 'please round off to 2dp and present as percent'. Excel calculate it as decimal first before it transform into percentage. Hence, either state as 'Present as percentage then round off to 2dp' or 'round off to 4dp as of the round() and present as percentage thereafter.'",0,0,Kelvin seah ,60801940

I earned a Bachelor of Science in Finance four years ago and wanted to take this course to review essential college level finance concepts and learn how to approach the valuation of startups. After completing this course, I feel ready to apply multiple analysis, venture capital financing concepts, financial statement analysis, and cash flow concepts to my professional development.
