115319266~COURSE!~lFZ_V6P6EeuGNhKc1QWwHQ,1670353777087,5,0,I think it's very useful if you want to apply this kind of models. I recommend to do it. ,0,0,Laura Fabregat Aibar,115319266
38472713~COURSE!~lFZ_V6P6EeuGNhKc1QWwHQ,1637561232931,5,0,I used Python and prefered to stick with general OLS models for panel data with some correction for heteroscedasticity (to be honest most of the time I work with logit models). I wanted to extend my skills since panel data is the most popular format in banking and finance where I work. I am really new to R but the lecturer explains everything so well I didn't even need additional info or help during the project. Would recommend it to all my colleagues! ,0,0,Киселева Ксения Костовна,38472713
