It's 2023. We need more diversity in Academia and in the creative industry. 2) This course needs to be urgently updated. References are from 10 years ago and many links are no longer working.

12723511~COURSE!~0QsUTZowEeWOGRJpcxIcbQ,1667443579445,3,0,"I would rate this course a 3.5/5. The biggest advantage of this course is the interviews with transmedia professionals who offer real examples of how to implement transmedia storytelling in various scenarios and also offer industry-relevant tips and strategies that can help us. This is supremely helpful from a practical perspective. However, at the same time, it feels like many of the interviews were done sometime in the past decade, since some of the things the people talk of (such as advancements in technology), are already underway or already obsolete. What I would have liked from this course (and which would have been better), was more staff involvement. Currently, just one staff member pops in occasionally to review assignments that are held up in review stage because of lack of students. But having experts guide us more closely by offering consistent assignment feedback would have helped. Overall though, this course does help you look at content creation and storytelling from a new perspective. I would say people who are already in the creative industry or with some personal experience in writing, designing and storytelling, can get much more out of the material here, than someone with zero experience in writing or storytelling. It was an enjoyable course, that can easily be completed in a week, if you already have a story in place. Good luck with your course :)",0,0,Nisha Prakash,12723511

They just keep talking about different plans and tips and each and every person gives some lecture about something and sometimes two of them give the same message.

It becomes hard to judge them in one basis because of their varying experience. I love the discussion prompt exercises and the readings available. It is quite an informative and helpful course to build your skills, know all aspects one should keep in mind while writing.
