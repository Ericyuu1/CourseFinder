In fact, I feel terrible if anyone ponied up $100+ for it.  It roughly covers some concepts of data science, but never at scale, and never very clearly.  My background is a science Ph.D. with a lot of computational science experience.  The lectures:  Clearly poorly planned.  Bill Howe has some knowledge about databases, but little skill in communicating it.  The organizational structure leaves much to be desired.  Much of the lectures are broad-brush and halting, simultaneously being too detailed as times and not broad enough at other times.  Technical portions are marked by a number of errors in speaking and on the slides, as well as a lot of hesitation and jargon.  It's as if he neither thought about the structure of what he wanted to say or a script of what he might say prior to recoding the session.  Phoning in it is an apt description.  The Assignments:  The first assignment with Twitter was fun and interesting and gets the course 2 stars instead of one.  The lectures prior to this will not prepare you for the assignment though, so might as well just skip them and do it on your own.  The SQL assignment followed a set of lectures in which no proper discussion of SQL was ever given.  The last assignment on Map-Reduce is acceptable although a number of errors in the homeworks are still uncorrected long after the first offering of this course.  The autograder's idea of helpful feedback is similar to ""Incorrect value.  Try again""  Week 4 of this course, which contains a vast amount of information has no exercises at all.Overall, this class is the polar opposite of a quality online course like Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course.

See Machine Learning by Andrew Ng to see how to design perfect, easy to operate and submit problem sets.
