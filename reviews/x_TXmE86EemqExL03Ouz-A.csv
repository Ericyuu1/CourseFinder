2814030~COURSE!~x_TXmE86EemqExL03Ouz-A,1657312016362,2,0,"I find it a huge organizational problem of the subjects of the specialization that you have to wait an infinite time to get your assignment reviewed. I have reviewed a lot of assignments, most of them did not comply with the demands of the corresponding assignment itself. I found it very frustrating to come across those assignments. It is very sloopy that there is no control of what is suitable to be reviewed, within a specific time-interval.",0,1,Milton Nogueira da Silva Junior,2814030
33708195~COURSE!~x_TXmE86EemqExL03Ouz-A,1605632061149,3,0,"If the
theory, methods, and tools (the ones used or similar tools) are new to you, you
will most likely love the specialization and the capstone. If you are familiar
with parts of the theory or some of the methods and tools the specialization
still offers a broad overview of the field and some interesting insights. For the
latter group (those who have some experience in the field of computational social
science) the capstone might feel a bit redundant. You can do the 4 assignments
in 10 to 20 minutes (because they are basically replicas of the peer-review
assignments of the previous 4 courses of the specialization and very simple).
You will then wait for days or weeks for peer reviews. That was a rather frustrating
experience of an otherwise good specialization. ",0,3,Ben Bonset,33708195

34933764~COURSE!~x_TXmE86EemqExL03Ouz-A,1642465039668,5,0,"T​he most challenging part was not the software related to learning the skills of computational social sience (NetLogo, Gephi), but the requirement and reliance on other software such as Excel, desktop screen recording and computer cameras to capture our work and narration, having to find a way to upload big video files - which for me meant starting a YouTube channel. All of that made the Capstone and earning the certificate in general super stressful. Waiting for peers to grade and counting on peers to grade carefully and well was also another disappointment and stressor. W​hat was taught and what I learned was amazing. Sometimes it was difficult to not have a solid source other than peers to ask questions. H​ighly recommend but not for people who want an easy course. ",0,0,Venetia Knuedler,34933764

20047284~COURSE!~x_TXmE86EemqExL03Ouz-A,1596865963439,5,0,"Well done to Prof. Hilbert for putting together a wonderful course. One thing I found is how hard it is to counter fake news from the artificial simulations. Shows how true the old saying is, when a lie (or advertisement) is repeated enough times, people start to believe it. That is the power of the media.I am keen to explore the potential of these tools further.One potential drawback is the stereo typing of individuals based on big data personality assessment. People can change overtime and not only that, the use of language can alter too. So the assumptions underlying the construction of natural language assessment may need to be reviewed to stay relevant.Do I now have experience with computational science? Yeah I believe I do. Thank you very much.",0,1,Andrew Ong,20047284

I sincerely hope he continues developing and delivering new courses like this in coming days. The specialization opened up worlds of new ideas to me. Highly recommended!,0,2,Aritra Halder,21933597
