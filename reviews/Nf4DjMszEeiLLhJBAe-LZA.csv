78090610~COURSE!~Nf4DjMszEeiLLhJBAe-LZA,1613373660285,2,0,The course overall was okay. I liked that there were questions to be answered throughout to make sure that people were reviewing the course. Having students to grade the work of others I feel was not a good idea because it seemed like many dropped the course and there were not enough assignments completed to grade in time to meet the deadline. I think this should be stated in the beginning of the first assignment for those that do not read through the whole course in the beginning. But overall I didn't connect well with the course.,0,2,Keiona LaTree Cook,78090610
