31543996~COURSE!~oqo7l8INEeqJbRLDK47tvw,1661046590759,1,0,"This course is an example of cheaply produced content farms that offer as much quantity as they can with little care placed to the source material.* Videos have extremely short voiceovers with basic slides* Readings are mostly links to other people's content* Quizzes are uninspired* In week two you can see the course creators have some huge mishaps on what lesson they are actually teaching. Nope python -m pydoc /path/file.py will not check for pep8 conformance, that's flat out wrong. They couldn't get the title right.I thought Coursera would be more curated. I'm relieved that I only audited this course.",0,0,Corey Hanson,31543996

81060220~COURSE!~oqo7l8INEeqJbRLDK47tvw,1618752514366,2,0,"There is very few material and the labs could be organized way better. In addition, tests go beyond the course material itself and ask details from documentation of specific python libraries. Also you dont receive any credit for partially correct answers in the multiple-choice questions. I expected to learn how to apply TDD. Should have watched some youtube videos or searched for some jupyter notebooks instead.",0,1,Thomas Hemmert-Pottmann,81060220
