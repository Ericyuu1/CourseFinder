I had to wait three weeks to get my peer reviews (week 1). Thank you to the reviewers. But it's obvious to me that there are simply too few course participants to go forward with a reasonable pace. Cancelling this course. Wishing patience and success to all participants.",0,0,Heinz DÃœRR,43139926

41277124~COURSE!~gja-ZYNWEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,1572802668727,4,0,"Nice opportunities for python coding of complex projects, which is wonderful. However, some of the specifications are rather unclear and it can be very hard to figure out why our code does not match the automatic grader's expectations! Also, the peer-marking system means that late comers might have to defer the end of their course indefinitely as they might not be able to get any other student to mark their work. This is a big flaw in the system. Not at all happy with that as it left a bitter taste at the end of a long waiting process to validate all my hard work.",0,2,Yoann H. Teo-Le Teuff,41277124

But don't let that discourage you - it's a great course where you can learn about basic climate process by DOING! ",0,1,Adrienn Gyalus,6682355
25258031~COURSE!~gja-ZYNWEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,1520854492896,4,0,"A very nice course! Thanks to the author(s)! I only find formulation of the problem a bit difficult to follow.   At first we see a video of the code commented by the professor, but at that moment we know only vaguely what are the knowns and what the unknowns , so its a bit confusing. I think it would be nice to explicit that somehow and make formulation more fluent.  Another thing, for some problems professor says that for Python is computationally hard to handle calculations with a big number of unit cells for example  (if I understood well). What is hard for Python of course is to plot a lot of things in real time,  for each step. If we plot only some number of iterations, or export results on another way its completely fine for python to do much more complex stuff. I'm sure professor knows this, but for new learners of Python  its confusing what he says.   ",0,2,Marijana Milicevic,25258031

7424439~COURSE!~gja-ZYNWEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,1471738702778,4,0," This contains some very interesting and challenging exercises related to ""Global Warming I"", which are fun to work on.   It contains no real instructions about python, and I think it would be better to at least have some guidance there.  However, the course info is at least totally up-front with that information.Although this course is related to ""Global Warming II"", it is not correlated with it.  It would be a mistake to take them concurrently, since GW-II moves much faster, and is a much shorter course.  This was not clear to me when I signed up, and it should be made clear to students at the beginning. I like Prof. Archer a lot, he seems like a good teacher.  However, aside from brief introductory lectures (and the selection of great topics for simulation)  he plays a rather small role in the course.  The student is pretty much on his own.  There is no TA or anyone monitoring Discussion questions.  There are some places where the ""Model Description"" notes are incorrect and badly misleading  (notably in Week 4).  I pointed this out, with others, in the ""Discussion Forum"", but we got no response and there was no correction.  There are other places where information is unclear, but there is no one to turn to for clarification. ",0,7,Frank Merritt,7424439

30525367~COURSE!~gja-ZYNWEeWxQQoymFg8zQ,1516275550304,5,0,A great introduction to using python for numerical calculations and graph plotting. Level of course is pitched perfectly for someone with experience of computer programming but new to learning python. The course material is structured very well: the course writer clearly put in a lot of effort to create really interesting exercises which made learning python very engaging. There was a nice mix between the early weeks of the course which offered approachable exercises and later weeks which provided more challenging but very rewarding ones.,0,1,Amy Briffa,30525367
