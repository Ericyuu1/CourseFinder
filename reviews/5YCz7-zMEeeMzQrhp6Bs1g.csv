10582891~COURSE!~5YCz7-zMEeeMzQrhp6Bs1g,1588441953729,1,0,"My first bad experience with Coursera content. It pains me to write this review, because it is always difficult to criticise other academics. The video lecture content throughout this course is very generic, like what one might hear about computer vision in a TED talk or on TV.One speaker's body language was very distracting, another's pronunciation is hard to catch and many slides are tackily animated, so I ended up reading the video transcripts instead of watching them. Most videos are 2 or 3 minutes long, and there aren't that many videos. It's almost as if somebody forgot to upload the rest of the lecture videos!The videos mostly contain introductions, applications and information surveys about various aspects of computer vision, with kitten and puppy pictures thrown in as ""examples"" to keep you interested. The student grapples with fairly complex programming assignments with no idea about where to begin. Each quiz contains only one qualitative Yes or No question, which was not related to the video.Though the course teaches you almost nothing about computer vision algorithms, it does squeeze in a few interesting minutes about human vision and basic optics, but that is not what a student who signs up for this course expects to learn here.The math section (one week's worth, out of four) is made up of four or five 1-minute videos about the importance of linear algebra and calculus, but there's not a single equation in sight. The supplementary material for the entire course consists of either Wikipedia pages or research papers that the lecture content does not prepare you to read and absorb.Even if you are a more senior industry professional interested only in a top level understanding of computer vision without getting into the math of it, you won't be able to complete the course because the programming assignments require some serious math skills that the course does not cover.All in all, not a recommended course for your time and money.

Then they want you to read some Wikipedia pages, and finally there's a problem that has to be solved with MATLAB.  Again, there is little to nothing in the material presented in the lectures to help you solve the graded problems.  At best, this course reminded me of stuff I mostly already knew, and enabled me to brush up on my rusty MATLAB programming skills.  This is an interesting topic, and the course could have been so much better.  Definitely not good value for the money.  On the plus side, it only takes a few hours a week for 4 weeks to complete the whole thing, and they don't make you grade your fellow students' homework - the grading is automated.
