12723511~COURSE!~jW1yfMwzEeqUchLV5-K1dQ,1650901050322,5,0,"As a South Asian, Indian and Hindu, I was very keen on understanding the conflicted relationship that my country and religion has with the environment. This course did justice to this by bringing to focus, both the good and the debateable aspects, of not just Hinduism, but all South Asian religions. This included Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Baha'i and the practice of Yoga. I only have one complaint  - some of the videos did not work and it would be great if the technical issues were addressed.
