106759622~COURSE!~j-zL7CvgEemV_A4t3mTtWg,1658646435944,3,0,"This course has some serious flaws.  It's supposed to be an introductory course, but no beginner can reasonably follow the content in the manner that it is delivered.   You'll get a video on a really simple topic like ""What is an Operationg System?"" and then immediately get hammered with massive amounts of technical vocabulary that is defined only by referencing other technical jargon.  It gets tossed out so fast that there's no serious time to assimilate any of it.  Even if you rewatch videos over and over, it's almost impossible to follow all of it.  This is a classic example of what happens when experts forget what it is like to be a beginner learning the material.  I really think the big issue is that the course isn't long enough.  They should double the length of the course and just go slower. The guy making the videos is passionate.  We could use more of him, but he needs to slow down.  Every topic deserves its own video.  The material should be explained with as little jargon as possible. They need to get a test audience of non-experts to try to follow it.  If they can't, rework things until it goes better.  At the moment, I don't get who this course is for.  It's an introduction to a topic that is only comprehensible if you are already an expert.    The quizzes are really hard and I don't think watching the videos prepares you for them.  You can pass them by reading through IBM documentation (hundreds of pages of which are linked in the course), but then why take the course?   The course could be structured in such a better way...
