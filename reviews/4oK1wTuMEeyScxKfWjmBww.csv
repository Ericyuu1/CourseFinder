However, I can't say that I am surprised that there is a strong bias towards those with darker skin. It's very unfortunate that some of those who have created these algorithms are targeting people based on their race.",0,0,Amanda Lee,110946041

I believe the questions in Week 1 could do with improvement in clarity and disambiguation, but outside of that I enjoyed this course and learned quite a bit, and reflected even more.",0,0,Juan Lopez,110894603
