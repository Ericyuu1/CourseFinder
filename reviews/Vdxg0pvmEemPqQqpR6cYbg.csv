390743~COURSE!~Vdxg0pvmEemPqQqpR6cYbg,1576189635587,1,0,"This course is for someone that already knows how to work with 2D and 3D graphics. If you don't know, you will be unable or have a hard time dealing with the assignments. They do not teach you how to do things step-by-step. They show a overall concept about something and in the next lesson you have to solve a problem with this concept. If you don't have a great grasp of 2D and 3D graphics this makes things a lot harder.The community is also really weak. No one answers you in the forums. Maybe I just enrolled in a time where there are just few people doing the course, but android graphics is also a very niche theme, so I suppose there will be never too many people doing this course at once.In the end this course felt more like a set of exercecises for someone that already knew how to deal with this kinda of thing to practice in its free time, while someone with good android knowledge but no graphics knowledge will just struggle to do anything.This is not an Android course, but a graphics course. So if you are just an Android developer, do not take this course. There are resources out there that can actually teach you step-by-step on how to deal with graphics if you are novice in the subject.",0,14,Deleted Account,390743
