91462096~COURSE!~MtDF2m7PEeqGsBJlYdig3w,1660720475936,3,0,"The material presented in this course was interesting and informative, and  I enjoyed the course overall. However, it differed from the other nine Coursera courses I have undertaken  in two ways:1.  There were very few videos - just a brief introductory video for each topic.  The remainder of the course required extensive reading of online material.  I may as well have read a text-book.2.  The majority of the material was not produced by the University of North Texas but has been taken from Concepts of Biology (OpenStax), with due acknowledgement.  Often, diagram numbers in the text refer to diagrams in OpenStax,  i.e. they have not been edited to correspond to diagrams in this course.One other criticism: the questions which are asked throughout the videos are often not correctly timed, and there is no indication of the format required when 2 answers are required (separated by commas, spaces or ?).

If you 1. don't have a passion for reading and/or 2. don't have a passion for science and the study of living organisms then you will not enjoy this course lol but being an avid reader and loving science as a pre-med student, I really loved it.
