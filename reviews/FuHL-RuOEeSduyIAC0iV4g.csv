With this course, i've personally learned a lot about the vision of international money and banking system; it provides you a complete abstract about how international payment system works and how banks/dealers use the money market (Fed Funds, REPO) to make markets in order to make them liquid and gain profits. Finally, he gets you into derivative's market (Credit Default Swaps, IRS, FRA, Futures) and how can you make those derivatives synthetically playing with different kinds of loans and debt. 
Last but not least, All the topics that the teacher deals with are framed within their respective historical framework.",0,1,Fabio Mazzoni,78150646

I would venture to say that most have not taken an economics course like this one before.  This definitely felt like a real college course.. 13 weeks of lecture, 2.5-3 hours of lecture each week.  I believe Professor Mehrling said in-class that the two prerequisites for this course (for Columbia University students, not Coursera users) are Intermediate Micro and Intermediate Macro, so the course is definitely fairly high-level.  To put it into perspective, I was an Accounting/Finance major with Econ minor and have CPA/CFA.  So while not ""trained"" in economics, I've had a fair amount of exposure, but I definitely felt intellectually challenged and frequently had to relisten to parts of lectures.  Definitely recommend this course!  Learned something every minute of every lecture.",0,8,Brad Headley,7377663

If this class grows increasingly popular, go long whatever company sells chalk because the professor consumes quite a bit as he sketches out a seemingly infinite number of T-accounts to illustrate the trading of money through multiple markets, including Fed Funds, EuroDollar, Repo, Swap and FX. By the end of the class, you get a good sense for the plumbing behind markets, and develop an alternative and practical view of what drives asset prices than what you perhaps learned studying economic or financial theory.  You also gain an appreciation for how big shadow banking is globally, how all money is not created equal, and how the value of any asset can change drastically through the mechanics of the dealer system as investors discover this point.

I particularly liked the systematic use of balance sheets for the presentation of the materials, the emphasis on History and institutions to understand the contemporary banking system, the explanations on the hierarchy of money and credit and of how all banking is essentially an exchange of IOUs (mostly created from thin air). The transition from traditional banking to shadow banking is very well explained. The role of the Fed as a liquidity backstop for the financial system, the eurodollar as a source of global funding and the causes of the financial crisis are all clearly presented.
