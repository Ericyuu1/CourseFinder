They require a simulator that does not work and all the questions have multiple answers and are extremely difficult. Also, there are A LOT of questions in every Quiz: 25. I am extremely sad, but I think I'm going to have to drop this course. It's the first time that I will have to do something like this, but I cannot lose my time repeating for ever an extremely difficult and impossible quiz in a course that it's not intended for professional physicians. I have notified Coursera several times about the extreme difficulty of the Quiz but nobody did anything. If in the future this Quiz is updated and made for learners, then I will happily continue the course. I've read in the Forum that many learners have had the same problems, but nobody arranged the Quizzes. Such a pity. The teacher is great and the lectures are fascinating.

It is unfortunate that the tests are not good.Many of the questions on the tests are ambiguous and at best, plainly more difficult than needed.Several of the questions are not covered in the same detail as the lectures.  Without a TA or somehow to provide guidance the exercise becomes frustrating.  Small details can be instructive, but not in the case of these tests.  I spent a lot of time with various interesting simulators only to come up short on the test.  This was not instructive.  If this were a university course I would be camped in the professors office...and not happy.By comparison, I recommend Chris Impey's U of Arizona 11 week astronomy course.  In order to pass the tests an understanding of the material is required, and the tests are instructive and useful.  More tests, but only 8 - 10 questions each.I will watch the remaining lectures, but I will scrap the tests.  Fortunately I have no reason to obtain a certificate.  Overall, I am disappointed.

The course material is excellent, challenging and well presented by the lecturer. I made an extensive summary in order to be well prepared for the first quiz.  In the quiz I got three simulators that were difficult to start (Flash problems) and without any explanation or exercise before - I could not answer the questions properly. Next to the simulators there were quite some questions that I could not answer with the knowledge I got during the course. I ended with a very frustrating 44% - this killed my positive feeling knowing that I had to read (but what?) and get knowledge somewhere else before trying the quiz again. I decided to stop - I want to learn exciting facts about the universe instead of moving (and being blocked!) from one frustrating quiz to another.

It wasn't just regurgitating information, which was good, it also meant I was scouring my notes and Google for a long time.
