7453841~COURSE!~ZOqHNEONEeaeRgqQhMBV5Q,1532726898953,2,0,"I found the course to be quite shallow. It focused too much on the overall negative effects of corruption (which I would assume is something most of the people interested in taking this course are already familiar with) and did not spend much time exploring solutions or innovative ways to address cases of deeply rooted corruption in both businesses and institutions. The course was not bad, but it was far from being a resource I would deem to have been useful in preparing me for dealing with future manifestations of corruption.",0,1,M,7453841

The professor is very organized and has a clear vision and understanding of corruption, which makes the process of knowledge pass-on very easy.However, the main problem (or hurdle) in this course is that it has a peer-review component, which in a sense might sound very helpful. Yet, it slows down your progress. I have completed the course with all its requirements a week ago, and still ""NO ONE REVIEWED MY SUBMISSION"" and ""I CAN'T FIND PEER SUBMISSIONS TO REVIEW"".In my opinion, this is just an obstacle to a rather good learning experience...I hope this can be fixed as the course is amazing itself.",0,2,Sarah El-Fiky,67687021

This course sparks my interest to learn more about advanced research outcomes with regard to controlling corruption. This 4-week course, unfortunately, is too short to dive deeper in the control measures for corruption. Anyway, I'd not recommend anyone take this course if they're only interested about this subject. Buying a book, you'd get a lot more out of it. However, if you're planning to finish the whole specialization then I think that'd be the only scenario where paying for this course is worth the money. Also beware of the peer-review, some people (a lot of them I believe) don't spend any effort in reviewing other people's works so you will not learn so much from your peers.

It's December 2022, and I had watched Servant of the People with the now-President Zelensky; in this comedy TV show, there was an entire episode of how he couldn't get a road built because of all the corruption.And in a Russian coursera course I took a year ago, the professor talked about how bad the roads are if you go about 50miles (?)  outside of Moscow, all because of corruption.
