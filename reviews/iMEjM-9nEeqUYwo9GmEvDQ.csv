84090798~COURSE!~iMEjM-9nEeqUYwo9GmEvDQ,1619189534082,5,0,"Great starter course, just what I needed to start building the stack. Those who are coming from an old HTML/CSS way of doing things, this is a nice intro to the javascript side, intro to backend node, intro to a simple API request, output that data to the screen. Simple and thats where it ends. Thanks so much for this. -Mike",0,0,Mike B (Beaupa),84090798
