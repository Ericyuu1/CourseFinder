I wanted to take this course as a stepping stone to see if I really had the appetite (and ability) to commit to learning again. It turns out I do. I'll probably move on to do the more detailed PV course available from the same team on Coursera. Congrats to Prof Drevillon and Erik Johnson on the structure of the course.
