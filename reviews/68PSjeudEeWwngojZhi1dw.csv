Various quiz questions come from material that's covered later in the course. 2) The larger issue is that the programming assignment is broken in many, many ways. In order to pass, you may need to read a large number of forum posts .. and hope that someone with your operating system and version has already solved the error.

There were several reasons for my disappointment:  First, it is very difficult to understand Prof. ChengXiang Zhai.  This is aggravated by the fact that the subtitles of his videos have not been edited and many of these subtitles do not really make any sense.  Furthermore, some of the quizzes check on material that is only covered in the week after the quiz.  Second, and more importantly, I was disappointed by the explanations offered by Prof. Zhai.  Often, he just drops some technical terms without giving any explanation whatsoever.  An example in point is his covering of the Kullback-Leibler divergence.  He just dropped the name but did not offer any definition or explanation.  Unfortunately, there were many more topics that were only covered in such a name dropping way.

15360832~COURSE!~68PSjeudEeWwngojZhi1dw,1467578857430,5,0,"This is not a class I would normally pursue. I took it as part of the ""Data Mining"" certification. That being said, this class was wonderful. I learned the basics of text retrieval and search engines. I went from knowing nothing, to having a working sense of how search engine algorithms work. It was a challenging course for me, but very much worth the time and effort I put into it. It was like pulling back the curtain on the code behind Google, Netflix, and Amazon searches, and that has made me think of the world in a different way. I am now a human happily collaborating with machine learning systems. Thank you!!",0,3,Melanie Cohn,15360832
