The lectures, while generally clear, are obviously read from a teleprompter, with no slides or real exercises provided. They lack a lot of substance and examples to fully illustrate the content, and have no interactive components. The instructor is clearly extremely capable and knowledgeable, but is unable to convey any of that information due to the structure of the lectures. The assignments meanwhile are way too difficult compared to the lecture material and severely lacking in feedback, explanation, or clarity. Half of the questions either have blatant errors, confusing wording, or requirements impossible for SQLite. Maybe this was partially my error, but it's not like the course was very helpful. In one of the lectures, on using DATE, the example in the lecture is formatted incorrectly, leading to a lot of trouble when doing the Quiz.S​ome questions will ask you about ""correlation"" or ""predicting"", which is fine and all, except for the part where SQLite doesn't support many of the fuctions neccessary for such analysis. I​ cannot recommend anyone take this course.

1435182~COURSE!~_8FRmSXkEeeCDQ44DPGlIA,1647084805484,1,0,"During the course, I wrote a review, and gave three stars. But now, I sense the need to change it and add to it. Yes, I have actually changed the final rating from three stars to only one star. (Below is a quick review, because I don't want to waste too much time on it.)In the beginning, it was claimed that certain participation in some so-called ""discussion"" was optional, but you had to participate in order to even be allowed to move on with the course. So the claim was false, and no one cared to take care of it. Or if the claim was indeed true, then indeed you did not have to participate, and it was indeed optional, and of course in that case you would not be allowed to move on. Either way, this immediately created a ""bad taste"" so to speak.There seemed to be errors or sloppiness in the quiz questions and in some of the sets of multiple choice answers, which was annoying. Some quiz questions were not very clearly put, so sometimes -- I would even say often -- it was difficult to understand the question. Sometimes it also seemed as though some of the quiz code questions suddenly went too far compared to the material taught, which is in part due to the course's lack of practice.The instruction videos were also poor, because they were not very well optimized. For example, the instructor's audio had a lot of ""wet sounds"" in it, so to speak. Also, the instructor's teaching was unpleasant to listen to, because it sounded awkward, as though overly scripted or very unnatural. There were also errors where some word or name did not match with code on-screen. Maybe she is a good instructor outside of Coursera, but you could not tell by these videos. Sometimes, the audio was even cut off, or so it seemed.Because of the earlier mentioned lack of practice from the course, you must do a lot of practice yourself. I already knew some things here and there, and usually find my way around computers, and so on, anyway, so sometimes I had an easier time. I also understood some of the statistical concepts they asked about later on.But even if so, I decided to quit during the final assignment, because (1) in the beginning of the final assignment (or rather right before it) it was unclear how to proceed on Coursera itself about it, and I wasted time finding out; (2) because of the course's sloppiness, it looked as though, after using only SQLite in the course, you suddenly had to use MySQL in Coursera's online sandbox (which may not have been a big deal, but is still strange a choice for a course), but really you had to enter some link and use the online SQLite interface with the Yelp dataset, which I only found out after roaming the so-called ""discussion"" fora for some time, wasting time in doing so;(3) the assignment itself had questions that should not even be asked, because some of the (statistical) topics were not even covered in the course, and, again, there had hardly been any practice in the course itself to prepare you, making it an even poorer course.I read some of the other reviews, especially the ones criticizing the course. Overall, relatively there are not that many giving low ratings, but they are right: it really is a poor course. I don't understand why the course has such a high score.In short, it is a poor course, no one cares to update it properly, and I would recommend to any other course taker to get the most out of it, preferably for free, and then to leave as quickly as possible.

Videos were helpful and informative but left many things unanswered without pointing learners to what these unexplained areas might be (so learner has to google and search about their confusion when they feel lost because something wasn't covered). The assessments and final project were the most disappointing part, however. The Yelp dataset was error-prone and incomplete which totally tarnished the final exercise. Questions were confusing and misleading, and the only saving grace were the wonderful community forums where users helped each other to troubleshoot all the sloppy mistakes in the dataset and wording of questions. Worst of all, these posts/errors are 3-4 years old and UC Davis has done nothing to remedy as of December 2021. It feels as if this course has had zero attention since initially being published and is riddled with confusing errors and dead-ends that are extremely frustrating for someone to learn a new programming language.

I did learn some SQL basics, but there are a lot of issues with this course. -​My biggest problem with this course (and Coursera) is plagiarism. You're randomly assigned to grade 3 peers' final assignments. I graded the first and second assignments, and on the third realized that it was an exact duplicate of the first. I reported the third for plagiarism, but I couldn't go back and report the first one, so that person just got a good grade for a 100% plagiarized assignment. If I hadn't been randomly assigned those two people, I wouldn't have known the assignments were copied. Coursera clearly doesn't have even the most basic automatic plagiarism checker set up, which would've caught exact duplicates. If the only way to identify and report plagiarism is for a student to get randomly assigned 2-3 assignments that happened to be duplicates, realize it, and report it, there's a major problem. This completely devalues the certificate.N​ow on to other issues:-A​s other reviewers have mentioned, the final assignment is a big jump from the work up to that point, and there aren't enough smaller assignments to test out skills. Lots of things that are mentioned in the lectures aren't included in the assignments, so you don't get to practice.-T​here are a ton of posts in the discussion forums mentioning various problems with course material, like typos or confusingly worded assignments--these posts go back as far as 4 years, and the same problems are still in the materials. Even easy fixes like typos in assignments haven't been addressed.-T​he moderators/course assistants/Coursera staff sometimes reply to questions in the forum, but it's rare, and the posts they reply to seem random. The forums are also flooded with 4+ years of sometimes pointless posts, so it's basically impossible to find anything relevant to whatever question you have.-​Many of the (automatically graded) assignments don't have examples of the correct code in the feedback, so if you get something wrong, you'll have no idea what you should be doing instead. The lectures don't come close to providing enough information to complete assignments, either.-​The rubric for the peer-graded final assignment is a mess. On some questions, the grader is asked if the code ""looks correct."" Well, maybe? I know that there are usually multiple ways to get an answer with coding, but there aren't any examples of what a correct answer looks like. If I got one of the questions wrong, there would be no feedback to help me figure out where I went wrong. Some questions have the option to give a grade of zero if the person left the question blank, but not all--so you could leave a question completely blank and still get points because there's no other option. -​One of the questions on the final assignment asks students to look at two columns of data and report whether they think there's a correlation. You can't do that. It's a ridiculous question. Especially because you can only see 10 rows of data at a time. And the course designer knows that, because the rubric says you get full points for attempting to answer the question--""It doesn't matter whether the interpretation appears to make sense based on the data or not."" Why does this question even exist?I​ had some other issues, but this has been a lot of typing and I'm pretty sure I'm yelling into the void anyway.

Unfortunately the instructor, content and presentation were really poor for this course.
The quality here really serves as a stain (in my eyes) on the reputation of UC Davis and Coursera.The instructor continually stumbled over her words as she read whatever teleprompter she was reading from during the presentations. It appears she didnt write the presentation herself as she stumbled through her presentations often creating wordy non-sensical explanations. It appears she never practiced the monologue before filming.In addition there were many mistakes in the code in the powerpoint presentations. This course has been around for many years with hundreds of thousands of students.

73379013~COURSE!~_8FRmSXkEeeCDQ44DPGlIA,1614029220200,1,0,"I originally wrote this review about halfway through the course and gave it 2 stars, but I just got to the final project and am amending it to be 1 star. My reasoning for one star is as follows:1) The instruction is often difficult to follow. The instructor will narrate with a snippet of code and a table or set of tables on the screen, but there won't be any visual aid to help follow along, as the slides are static. She also frequently stumbles over herself while reading from her teleprompter, so the combination of the static slides and her directionless cadence makes it very hard to keep track of what is going on.2)  The evaluations are split into two types, one of which is informational, one of which is coding. The questions of the former type very rarely reflect any sort of understanding and are more about rote regurgitation of information found on the (poorly formatted) slides. After taking a quiz or two, you come to realize that virtually any time a list is written on the screen, you had better write down every item on that list because there will be a ""select all that apply"" question at the end. Sometimes writing it all down doesn't even work, as she doesn't take care to make sure her headers and data match up. A parallel to the kinds of lists she often uses would be:Types of Vegetables1. Celery, 2. Cauliflower, 3. Vitamin C is good!, 4. Carrots, 5. Make sure to eat your vegetables! The subject she is teaching revolves entirely around key-value pairs, and her slides don't reflect any sort of understanding of that relationship. If that table only accepted ""vegetable"" as a data type, she would get an error.  3) The coding evaluations, on the other hand, are extremely difficult as they extend the information well beyond what was taught in the preceding lecture, and almost no time is given to allow you to explore how the code works. The course thrusts you into a situation where you're writing code in a language with which you have almost no familiarity (and SQL has pretty poor error handling, and no custom error handling is written to help you understand where you went wrong). I strongly, strongly recommend Coursera learners take another class or use some other tool to learn SQL. I used a free instructional tool and felt so much more competent after 10 minutes of messing around on it than I did after watching an hour of lecture.4) The material is often presented as her opinion rather than factual information that should be learned. I've taken a number of courses on Coursera, and they've been treated professionally, where information delivered was generally factual. If the professor wanted to inject opinion, it would be made clear it was opinion, and an evaluation may read, ""Which of these may make x easier"" or something like that. This instructor will phrase things like, ""What did I say was the most important thing to know..."" which just seems unprofessional. EDIT: Another example in response to a correct quiz answer was ""You're not actually writing the query to the database or anything. What you're doing is you're just kind of storing it for the time being.""Look at that last sentence.I could go on, but all in all, this course didn't even begin to resemble the level of professionalism or quality I've seen in other courses on Coursera. It reminds me of being peer taught during my education degree, full of teaching methods and lacking instructional skill. However, it's the only one that popped up as a beginner's course on SQL, so I finished it out. I regret doing so.",0,4,Stephen Carroll,73379013

Honestly, I don't think the true grading is a one star, it would probably be between 2.5 and 3, but I believe that at this point if we don't give a terrible rating back, neither Coursera nor UC Davis and the faculty/staff serving this course will take action to improve it.  There is a lot to be criticized/updated.I strongly recommend you read other reviews, going back to as long as 2 to 3 years in the past where these flaws are clearly outlined and appointed by former students, and yet in Jan 2021 they are all still there. In summary:-videos are of hardly any help. The instructor (clearly a knowledgeable person) is hindered by having to read from a teleprompter. The text given to her is not what she would've said spontaneously, so more often that not we see her get caught between what she is thinking versus what she is reading to speak, and this causes confusion during explanation of some hard to grasp moments.-slides are static and don't provide any significant help in making the hard content really easier to understand. In a course aiming at teaching a code language, we need dynamic video content, seeing the queries being written and the resulting output, and a demonstration of how a change in parameters results in a change of the output. -the sandbox environment for practice is extremely limited and gets in the way of allowing naive students to really understand some of the dat structure in the background. -the gap between theory and practice is gigantic, and the code assignments at the end of each module are light years away from what was taught. This is particularly painful with the last peer reviewed assignment, which would require at least one additional full week of time after the end of the 4 modules to give students a chance to understand the data, work with it and craft their answers. If you take this course, you will end up learning useful SQL content, but this will be at the cost of several additional hours spent googling results and support everywhere on the web. If googling was going to be our primary source of learning anyway, then what is the point of having the course in the first place? People enroll in course because they expect that the instructor, lessons and exercises will steer and help them through the initial learning before they are ready to move on their own, and this is exactly where this course fails. I came to the course already knowing other programming languages and with a good database and data background, so I could ""brute force my way through googling"", but I can only imagine what other less prepared students could feel. Your money is probably best spent elsewhere if you want to learn SQL (or even no money at all in some good websites on the net).",0,23,Felipe Fittipaldi,78081249

Since this course was mainly a SQL tutorial, I would have expected it to be more geared towards grading the SQL code. However, most of the assignment points went to interpretations and approach. Each question needs to have the point values changed to reflect the importance of SQL coding and reduce the value of interpretation.Half of the submissions I was given to grade were incomplete.

Better SQL projects are found on YouTube, but these do not give a certificate endorsed by an educational institution such as the University of California, Davis.

Not her fault as a presenter, the videos were just going too slow imo. There were a few typos in the lecture slides, one of which was quite confusing (I have reported them separately).

Unfortunately what really stood out in a negative way was the peer-graded assignment. This *really* needs to be rewritten. Specific problems:

Part1
=====
Questions 5 to 7 could be answered in two different ways: one, which is the ""easier"" one and the one that the marking guide forced us to accept, is to read off review_count from the Business table (and descend-order it). The first few results this way are

+-----------------+---------+
| city            | reviews |
+-----------------+---------+
| Las Vegas       |   82854 |
| Phoenix         |   34503 |
| Toronto         |   24113 |
| Scottsdale      |   20614 |
| Charlotte       |   12523 |
| Henderson       |   10871 |
+-----------------+---------+

The problem with this is that the data set we're working on is a SUBSET of the full Yelp set. This means that the Business.review_count column (which was presumably added there in a redundant, denormalized way, in order to speed up queries) contains much higher counts than the ones that would be obtained by actually joining the Business and Review tables (on business id) and grouping by city. Here are the first few results of this approach, which imo is the correct one:

+-----------------+---------+
| city            | reviews |
+-----------------+---------+
| Las Vegas       |     193 |
| Phoenix         |      65 |
| Toronto         |      51 |
| Scottsdale      |      37 |
| Henderson       |      30 |
| Tempe           |      28 |
+-----------------+---------+

I would be totally ok if the marking guide gave us the choice to accept both methods, but that wasn't the case.


Part 2
======
Q1 of Part2 was badly worded and unclear. It asks us to ""pick a city AND a category"" but then to group the businesses (by star rating) ""in that city OR category"". What exactly does that mean? Lump together all businesses from eg Phoenix (regardless of category) with the eg Restaurants businesses (regardless of city)? What's the rationale behind this? Or was it meant to read ""in that city AND category"" (meaning that we would only consider restaurants from Phoenix)?

Also, Q1.iii is both random and vague: why location? What do you mean by location (zip code? longitude/latitude?). This ties to the above ambiguity (X=AND vs X=OR in ""in that city X category"").",0,0,Greg Sotiropoulos,75555611

And also, there are some other aspects which do not appear in the course, but which I feel would be useful, such as perhaps how to use database management systems themselves to extract data to your computer, since in this course you only learn  how to write queries, and not how to extract the information you've queried to your computer.In addition, I think the database used for the final task is flawed, and this gives some strange results when performing it.On a more positive note, I did actually learn a lot from te course, and I think the proramming tasks where really helpful, and actually kind of interesting, as you get the chance to play around with your queries and experiment with the results (despite the aforementioned flaw).",0,0,RODRIGO TORAN SIERRA,26880139

The polling questions are excellent during the lecture videos, as they keep the participant engaged and check understanding of subject.

I thought the BETA Sandbox was a wasted of time becasue I could never get it to function (and then I discovered I didn't need it anyway).  For other Mac people (like me) the Notepad++ the instructor mentions in one of the early videos is a Windows only thing.  If you have Parallels, it won't matter.  If you prefer MacOS, give SQLiteStudio a try.  It was free at GitHub and worked well.  Most of the data coding examples in the coding labs come from the Chinook.db.  The instructor uses some version of the Northwind database for SQLite.  Then, there are some other videos that I really don't know where the data came from.  All of this is to say that this course would benefit GREATLY if all databases used in the course were availble to students from the start.  Then again, you may enjoy digital treasure hunts to find these things for yourself.  Cheers!  BEB",0,0,Bruce Beck,100800053

I want to say thanks at the UCDAVIS team and teacher Sadie St. Lawrence for doing such an interactive and professional course, something that I love is that the teacher is always in the videos explaining all the topics and in general the exercises, this is very professional already that other courses only put audio and slides and that character that teachers bring to classes is lost.

39711907~COURSE!~_8FRmSXkEeeCDQ44DPGlIA,1596464901322,5,0,"In general, the course is not bad, but there are a number of disadvantages, ranging from minor to serious omissions. I wanted to give the course 3 stars, but the last homework was quite fun and productive (you can put 4.5, according to the rules of mathematics, round to 5, but with a very large advance). The basic skills were acquired during the last assignment. First, about the benefits of the course:  1+ In the course, you can practice on real data without using other software, it is really useful and productive; 2+ Theoretical aspects are more than enough; 3+ Theoretical tests correspond to the lecture materials.  Now to the disadvantages (there are still more of them), first to the serious ones:  1- There is a lot of so-called ""Water"", information that is completely unimportant and purely theoretical. Almost the entire first week was devoted to theory (""Why is this subject important? Separation of duties among employees, etc.). I think the course would have done well without these materials. Often, one fourth of the length of each video is an explanation of what we will be studying today. I think , the student wants to quickly learn important material for him.  2- The first 2 weeks of coding looks very good, easy to understand and solve for yourself. But something strange happened on week 3, the tasks became much more complicated, they did not correspond to the lecture materials, where theoretical material was mainly given. Week 4 has already been done normally. Probably, without prompts (sometimes direct), I could not have done these tasks. It was very difficult!  3- The course is rather short (only 4 weeks), little time is devoted to programming, there is not enough practice, maybe it was even worth adding a small invaluable practice after each video.  4- The lecturer tried to convey the idea that the usual repetition of programming steps may be ineffective. Unfortunately, today, nothing is better than ""I copy after the lecturer, who explains something in parallel, and then independently practice it on real data."" The lecturer's methodology was not the most effective; nevertheless, after completing the course, many questions remain.  Minor disadvantages:  - For the convenience of work, you can download the presentation of the lecture, but I think it is convenient for some students to print these lectures and work. Unfortunately, the design and background were chosen in a dark color, which is why the material after printing is inconvenient to read (-a lot of paint is wasted), it is rather difficult to correct it yourself.  - The material chosen for reading by the lecturer is slightly robotic, it is convenient to set at a speed of 1.25 or 1.5.  In any case, I was able to familiarize myself with this programming language, I was able to learn something. I think one day it will suit me. At the moment, I still prefer to work in Python and other programs. I was still able to get a certificate of completion of the course. Thanks for the course and thanks for your attention to this long comment! Hope it helps you get better! Good luck :)",0,1,Шайдуллин Ансэль ,39711907

I took this course with basic knowledge of SQL, that is, I had experience in programming in the MySQL language. This course helped me understand more about databases and learn more about the structured query language operators used. I created a table with data for competently building queries, and therefore the code that was given in the lectures had to be adapted to my table. But you can download the Chinook Database in the public domain, as many examples are written for this data. The training is conducted in the SQLite language, but also tells about the features of other languages.Have a nice course to everyone who wants to study it!

Most data science jobs ask for SQL so I thought this was the perfect starting point for learning. I found learning the language fairly straightforward, especially because many SQL-type commands are built into R packages (like dplyr). My job has a comprehensive relational database but, I usually use a point and click interface to make queries- now that I'm more proficient I'll start using SQL though. Additionally, I was hoping to pick up SQL before starting my grad program in analytics so I can ""hit the ground running"" and be ready for classes focused on database management and data engineering. I was able to accomplish this without any question.I really liked the course, which is not surprising given all of Coursera's data science content is excellent.
