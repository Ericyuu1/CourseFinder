The flow and content of the weeks, with the practice questions ensured a good knowledge on what NCA is, how to use it, and how to interpret it. The ""pitfalls"" or common misunderstandings helped me be cautious of not making the wrong assumptions when evaluating the results. ",0,0,Indy Oostrom,82985566

1555061~COURSE!~0Ri24j7BEeuWjxL2VTBhwQ,1657890902004,5,0," NCA is not just a method of data analysis, it is another way of thinking about the relationships between variables (assuming that most of us are used to regression or modeling of structural equations – sufficiency logic). I recommend this course to all those interested in understanding and researching necessary conditions (critical success factors). The course contains videos, examples, and suggestions for readings that will make life easier for those who are new to this method and update the knowledge of those who have already read the 2020 book (*) I really enjoyed it and recommend it.
