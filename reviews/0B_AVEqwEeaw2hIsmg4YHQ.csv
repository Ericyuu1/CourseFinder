There don't appear to be any moderators.If something's marked wrong, go to the discussion board and see what the other students who appear to be understanding the material say.  Sometimes other students have discovered the quiz asked for voltage, but accepts current as right, sometimes it asks for answers rounded to three decimals but only accepts the answer rounded to 2, other times the answer is clear, but nobody's managed to figure out what the grader wanted (particularity on the quizzes for the final two weeks.

I found the course to be a very good refresher of the material.The lecturers were clear in their presentation of the content.  I also enjoyed the lab demonstrations peppered throughout the course. I only wish there had been more of these! As a recovering software engineer who has thus far shied away from anything hardware, I hope to get my hands on some equipment and try some of these demos myself.There were a few hiccups, however. Some of the answers given to the questions were wrong, and this caused quite a bit of annoyance until I started referring the discussion forums. The lecturers were not active in the forums at all - something that's perhaps understandable for a course of this scale. I also wish that they had gone into  a bit more detail perhaps by assuming a more advanced mathematical background on the part of the students, but maybe that's not prudent for an introductory course.Altogether, I am glad I took this refresher, Onto AC analysis!
