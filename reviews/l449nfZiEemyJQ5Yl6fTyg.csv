It appears to focus mostly on law, but it's still a valuable editing course.One thing that needs fixing (or explaining in case I missed something) is to distinguish between paying and non-paying participants. I keep getting marked as ""overdue"" even thought I completed all the requirements by the due date. I think it is because I was not able to submit quizzes for grading since I was a non-paying student. It is still unfair to give me an ""overdue"" mark.I come back a month later and find message that I did not complete assignments in time. Not true, as explained above.
