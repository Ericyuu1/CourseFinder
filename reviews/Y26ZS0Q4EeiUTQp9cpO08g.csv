There are many videos going over 20 minute mark. Not a single quiz, graded or practice, will give you the explanation, I have taken other courses from John Hopkins too, this was the first time I was having this issue. Many times the faculty will move the mic leading to a distorted voice. Many times the slides will be just plain and boring. Many times I wondered should I continue the course or not. But disregarding the execution, its 5 star content helped me a lot. On a side note, take another statistics course before coming here. Faculty is one of PHDs who will keep on saying jargons to make him sound smart, even if it was not his intention, leading to the confusion many times. He even said about statistical inference and other high level topics in the first week. I highly doubt that a beginner can properly understand what he even meant to say as there is not even a glossary for this course.In summary: 5 Star Content, 2 Star execution.

But still I needed some support because I had many doubts. So I tried the course.. The strengths: nice lectures and examples by the Professor, very useful the assessments. I cleared my doubts on Summary Statistics. The weakness: on the last section (survival times) some concepts were introduced but with less explanations (hazard ratio, cumulative probability, incidence rate calculation). So it was hard and I assed the exam on the first attempt I think also because I have studied before some Statistics. I give 5 stars after all because it really gives you a structured and complete mindset of the summary statistics. ",0,0,Ioannis Kartalas Goumas,99310423
