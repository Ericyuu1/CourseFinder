103046815~COURSE!~Z247QYWVEeqV3g4-gCv8JQ,1647965638588,1,0,"Slides and videos are particularly out of coordination with eachother and the assignment. Assignments in general are lacking, and because the material is on 4 different mediums the course itself is falling apart seperately as the seperate mediums aren't getting attention. Week 4 has an error in AutoGrader where it looks for the wrong URL and concatonates the app main to many times. This can be subverted with additional URL paths, but it's ridiculously broken and a waste of time and money.

11005035~COURSE!~Z247QYWVEeqV3g4-gCv8JQ,1652467202297,2,0,"This course suffers because the topic is too advanced to be aimed at beginners. Too much of the course is spent explaining concepts like OOP, HTTP Networking, Linux adminstration, etc. Many students seem to struggle because these concepts are glossed over without enough depth. But as a result, people like me who are familiar with these concepts end up having to sit through lectures that don't add anything and are a waste of time. These topics should be well understood by the time a student starts using django, and if not - learning it is not the scope of this class.Also, t​he forums are not very active, you should not expect to receive much help if you are stuck. Posts months old have no responses.A​dditionally the professor is nice, but his lectures are a bit chaotic because he is not well prepared. Lots of stumbling, and awkward explanations when the section probably should have been just re-recorded. Overall feels like a MOOC from 2012 that hasn't been updated in 10 years, even though the concepts are on a modern topic. Back then, lectures were transfered from the classroom to video and it was acceptable. But now-a-days there are much better ways to engage and teach a topic than talking over a powerpoint. L​astly, I don't think the way the assignments work is very helpful. So much of it is spent ""copying"" from example code, rather than writing yourself. Assignments don't really give good requirements, and instead are just a process of slightly changing supplied code to meet the (largely unstated) requirements. The auto-grader also gives poor feedback so debugging is a challenge. I​ don't think I will take course 4. ",0,0,David Jones,11005035
