Now I have clear goals to work with: no hostile attribution bias, not to be excessive reassurance seeker. Though, for my point of view it needs some polish. - Entire course is possible to complete in 1 day, due to NO homework, NO lectures, NO extra resources for study. - The topic is not disclosed and leaves more questions than answers. Lecture ""Does popularity change when moving to a new context?"". Why they didn't make experiment with selecting only popular kinds from all schools and putting them together? Most probably, roles would change. There was similar experiment on rats https://steemit.com/psychology/@natord/social-roles-exploiter-worker-whipping-boy-and-independent - No links to resources. I would like to see more details on experiments. I would like to know more data of experiments such as how many children were participating? - Data is not structured. Charts with one axis, one curve with two names. The idea is clear, but not mathematically expressed correctly. - Strange analyze of data. Difference of 6% considers as a huge one, difference of 30% not important. - Contradictive course. First he said it's almost impossible to change group, later he provides fact that in 2 year 58% of not aggressive - rejected (50% of all rejected) kids becomes not rejected.  - Some terms are not explained and used as everybody should know it. For example I find internalizing/externalizing symptoms not very common.  ",0,9,Maria Minakova,237426

2159276~COURSE!~0EqoQy7_EeWPngoW78wA_Q,1496898180336,4,0,The topic itself is such a novel one to dissect. Popularity effects/ affects us in many ways and the studies undertaken in this course explains how society shapes you in a certain way. Good or Bad it's a great revelation for one and all as we understand ourselves a bit better after we take the course. For me it was enlightening at multiple levels. Certain aspects of the study isn't covered though. Children can belong to varied categories based on their peer group. In this course the study assumes that children will belong to one peer group at a time. Peer groups can vary in a child's life - for eg: the peer group of their school would be different from the one in their neighbourhood. This case isn't considered and this would open up a whole new set of possibilities in understanding a person's mental make up. But it's a great first step. Kudos. ,0,1,Rohit Nair,2159276
