35263302~COURSE!~9_OIYfdDEeWfYgqbi1xsdw,1615765706779,2,0,"The covered material is useful, but the presentation is... well, not so nice. The professor writes with a pen on a glass board, and his handwriting is a catastrophe (it's not about individual letters, but the way he clutters up space in a completely unorganized way), and on top of that it slows down the delivery. So I ended up just reading the summaries and watching the demonstration videos and only referring to the videos when needed.The mini projects are way too easy in my opinion, though useful.But my main criticism is that the course's title is ""Parallel Programming in Java."" However, the course doesn't teach you the Java API, which it definitely should. It recommends using RecursiveTask from the Fork/Join framework to implement a future, which is kinda stupid. It certainly works, but if you do it in real life, it immediately exposes you as ignorant of Java's API. No mentioning of Executors whatsoever. Doesn't teach you how you can distinguish the number of logical and physical cores, and indeed the provided unit tests are all such that you can get 100% from the Coursera grader, which uses 4 tasks, but will let you fail if you run it on an octacore AMD Ryzen 7 with 16 threads, because it unrealistically (for CPU-bound tasks) expects almost 16-fold speedup from your parallelized solutions. In the end, you're left wondering if it is better to construct a ForkJoinPool yourself or to use the commonPool(), or whether you should call submitAll() or fork(), or whether you should construct your Phaser with 0, 1 or the number of tasks, and what the difference between awaitAdvance and awaitPhase might be, instead of leading by example and showing you a clean use of the API. On top of that, it introduces you to Rice's HPDP (or something like that) library... That's cute (and to be fair, the libary seems quite useful and elegant), but it's not really what people come here for.I can say that I learned something from this course, but I would not have wanted to pay for the course if it wasn't included in Coursera Plus.",0,0,Jakob Ullmann,35263302

You can do your task right way, but it will not pass test from the first time and you are not sure if your are doing something wrong or what is the reason of the failure.

One area for improvement is the automated testing grader of the projects.  The projects are graded on percentage speedup of your parallelized code, but sometimes they would pass locally while not pass on the testing server.  Then I just had to keep submitting the same code over and over again until the tests finally all pass.  It's nice the number of times you can submit is unlimited, but having to submit the same code just to pass a certain speedup threshold is not the best use of time.Overall, I learned a great deal, and appreciate all of the hard work that went behind putting together a course like this.
