4284842~COURSE!~3ZbFIBc-Ee2OIA59BrOT3Q,1671763384270,3,0,"The course is more of an Activist Action Plan with talking points to push the UN Sustainable Development Goal Seven to transition the world's energy sources from carbon to 'sustainable' and 'renewable' energy sources: By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services.  The course barely mentions or fails to mention the foundational rational, constraints and risks of the Energy Transition Plan, considerations that are integral to any serious plan. The course would have more substance if it presented guests with alternate views and also discuss the risks to The Plan. Instead, it encourages group-think (to use the current flavor of wokism wordology) and discourages critical thinking. On the positive side, it does present  a Project Management style of attacking the formidable problem of a global energy transition,  but only a glimpse of the enormous obstacles facing the goal.",0,0,Gary Upshaw,4284842

As a safety and regulatory professional, and policy developer within industry, there is much more that we can do in development of the resources we have available, and in sourcing new technologies to reduce our environmental footprint while creating investment and maintaining production. Research and recommendations to political representation on promotion and cost reduction of these available technologies is one area to make work better.",0,0,Stuart McKibbin,105333531
