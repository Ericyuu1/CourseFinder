10457624~COURSE!~XD-TddyuEeeWJRKNrJVcVg,1537993068776,4,0,"What I did not like about the course was the part of the development of an API with Greengrass and lex, since the explanation is concise and much time is lost in the initial configuration and not in part of the development of the Amazon modules.I recommend explaining from the beginning the cloud service that will be used and working more sessions on how to handle AWS tools for IoT, since AWS feels a different concept of IoT, Greengrass that confuses the public.",0,1,Javier Pinzón Castellanos,10457624
