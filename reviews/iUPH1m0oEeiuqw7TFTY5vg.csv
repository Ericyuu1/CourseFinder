2789322~COURSE!~iUPH1m0oEeiuqw7TFTY5vg,1562964144501,2,0,"The lectures could use more organizational structure. There is a difference between a viewing audience and a reading audience. Especially when listening, the audience needs to be introduced to an idea and that idea needs to be repeated more than once to get the point across. I feel that the teacher is trying to tell a story that rambles on and we aren't always sure whats important, and why its important, and the characters seem to jump around back and forth through time. The teacher is obviously quite learned but the whole pedagogical style isn't well suited to online learning.",0,5,Patricia Chang,2789322
35832307~COURSE!~iUPH1m0oEeiuqw7TFTY5vg,1605464156855,3,0,"By the end I just wanted to finish it.  I have a passing interest in China and things Chinese, so I'm supplementing my other learning with this course on religion and thought.  It felt like a history of philosophy course and I think some of the broader points are missed when you go into this level of detail about minor points.  I saw the learning objectives for each section, but had to remind myself what they were by the time I finished each one.  I enjoyed the lecturing style and learned a lot but think it could be restructured.  But perhaps I wasn't the target audience. ",0,0,Benn,35832307

30794143~COURSE!~iUPH1m0oEeiuqw7TFTY5vg,1606814756495,5,0,"I have been able to complete three of the four MOOC's in this Chinese University of H.K. series— and they are all magisterial as taught by John Lagerwey, Research Professor at CUHK. The multi-volume textbook is expensive, so that this is a a great opportunity to obtain a selective overview!Thirty or forty years ago we were told in English-language publications that little was known about the practice of Buddhism in ancient China, esp. Chan. This is obviously not (or no longer) the case. The course is about the kaleidoscopic synthesis of the ""four Chinese religions."" Many actors are cited or quoted, so there is necessarily some confusion but on the whole the story is clear. It might be a good idea to encourage students to produce an online glossary of terms and names.The instructor is warm and personal but the automated captions have not been checked for error and there are some annoying non sequiturs in the text. The instructor vastly overuses the term 'okay', which is a distraction. There's also a small handful of quiz items that are either unanswerable or do not appear in the talks. However, no one who has not followed these lectures will be sufficiently up to speed on Chinese history and culture. They constitute a remarkable achievement.",0,0,David Stewart,30794143
