Some of the material that was to be downloaded was not possible and when I sent an enquiry on how to access the docments/information, I received no response. This is not conducive to motivating participants when they have the feeling that no one is attending their queries. I would like to know how the system works on this type of course as the previous courses I have enrolled in were of a different nature than this one.I found the challenges of composing essays on the individual themes each week quite a challenge and enjoyed researching the themes even though we were restricted in the number of words permitted. Sometimes I was disappointed that some participants did not fulfil the required number of words and again wondered how the organisers deal with such submissions? How is it possible to receive a feedback from Simon Rolfe?Looking at some of the +submissions over the weeks, I noticed that some were quite ""old"", i.e. a few years old and was wondering if the content of the videos was similar and just generalities were being put forward. The link to some further reading was also not of the recent past, does this mean that standard material is being used and not updated?In general, I found that the videos in week 5 were a resume of the previous ones with considerable repetitions and another issue that puzzled me was the fact that after week 4 I was informed that I had ""passed"" the course when, in my opinion, the most challenging essay was the one to be submitted was at the end of week 5.

One should keep in mind that this is intended as an *introductory* course into the vast, complex and multi-disciplinary field that is diplomacy, and although objectively easy to complete, this course features the exact level of difficulty someone new to this field would benefit from. In fact, it is one of the major factors that personally kept me motivated throughout, and I am actively deliberating on whether to buy the certificate to flaunt my accomplishment.All in all, this course offers an engaging and relatively reader-friendly bibliography, a varied but concise list of reading materials that are almost obligatory for the succesful completion of the assignments, summative videos that set the scene for every module and are sources of useful information for the tasks, and quite a good simulation of academic discourse and interaction through their peer assessment tool.Areas for improvement include more targeted reading material (for instance, in Week 5, it is mainly the 5 'Projective Visions' within the 18-page long essay that are of substance, so a simple note to that would go a long way) and a better graded assessment scale. To be more precise, as it stands, one can only award a student 0 or 1, the latter standing for a ''genuine attempt'' to fulfill the task and the former signifying the opposite. This becomes especially problematic when one has to grade responses that mgiht be ''genuine'' in that there appears to be no plagiarism, but the student obviously didn't read the module materials and just breezed through the videos, offering hurried input that does not merit a full grade. In some cases I had to go with zero, but felt that a 0.5 would be more fair to said students, or a 2/3 and so on.I wish the course creators all the best and I hope to meet them in person, if my studies ever bring me to SOAS.",0,7,Panagiotis Koutalos,41601631
