There were lots of transcription errors, and many students will have had great difficulty in understanding what was said.The recommended software is not easy to install, and the scraping software not easy to use. His suggestion (use Google as your IT department) shows an attitude that I find unprofessional.

The teaching is clear and at a low enough level that everyone can understand; no math or prior social science knowledge is required. However, for the in-video questions that appear, I recommend that you include a picture of what you're referencing in order to answer the question when appropriate. For example, in module 2, there were a few questions requiring us to calculate the degree, closeness degree, etc of a given network. However, the question prompt blocked the view of the network, so I had to rely on memory of the network in question to answer the question. It would've helped if there was a picture of the network in the prompt itself to serve as a reference for us to use to answer the question. ",0,5,Everett Almeida,52325881
