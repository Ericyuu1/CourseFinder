venía sintiéndome orgullosa con poder ir haciendo los cursos gratuitos
otorgados por la tan “prestigiosa” Universidad de Stanford, por su buena
calidad educativa, pero con lo que acabo de ver, en cuanto a calidad humana me
ha dejado bastante que desear. Cuando completé los cursos tan contenta con
excelentes notas, estaba dispuesta totalmente a comprar mis certificados, hasta
que vi el siguiente mensaje “Al marcar este cuadro, reconozco que proporcioné
mi nombre legal, que soy mayor de 13 años y que no soy de Irán, Sudán, Crimea ni Cuba”. Al leer este comentario,
comencé a sentir indignación, dolor, porque es enteramente racista que por tu
país de origen no acepten a personas de esos países ¿Tiene algo de malo que
sean de ahí? ¿Son menos personas por venir de esos países? ¿No tienen derecho a
aprender acaso? Me pareció triste e indignante que en pleno siglo XXI, existan
todavía esta clase de exclusiones, requisitos engañosos están manejando. No
pueden tener un certificado por venir de esos países entonces, por eso y con
mis sinceras disculpas, no acepto ni puedo aceptar ninguno de los certificados,
porque no puedo tener algo así en mi currículum, algo que mientras yo lo goce
otros por su país no pueden tenerlo, entonces lo considero demasiado injusto.
En nombre mío y por el amor que tengo por las personas sin distinción de
nacionalidad, no acepto los certificados. No tengo nada que agradecer mientras
siga viendo esta limitación hacia esos países. Saludos.",0,0,Tamara Belén Mandaliti ,54080851

16094805~COURSE!~iQZflcZ7EeOoFhIxOQQuEA,1447253879188,1,0,"I am really disappointed with the content of this course. If what you're looking for is the most basic of information on making better choices and remembering to wash your cutting board after handling raw meat, maybe this course is for you.  If, however, you come to this course wanting specific information about how to build great meals for babies, toddlers, and young children, or you'd like to know how their needs change over time, this course is not for you. I was hoping for information like how to teach your toddler to chew/eat difficult things (ex: whole apples).  I wanted to know at what age/weight you switch to 2% milk.  I wanted to know how many calories a meal should be based on height and weight and how that changes over time. I wanted to know medically verified tips on getting the right amount of each nutrient into a toddler's diet and what, if any, extra vitamins should be added. I wanted tips on weaning if you're still nursing a toddler... I guess I just wanted more.In addition, the quizzes are so easy as to be silly. Actual quiz question and correct answer:  Which is NOT a good way to approach grocery shopping if healthy choices are desired?  Answer: Visit the supermarket hungry and walk through the candy aisle first. COME ON! Did I need a Stanford University course to tell me that one?!?!? While the instructor is knowledgeable, this course is geared toward someone with NO knowledge, not someone who wants to gain a deeper understanding. The videos are painfully slow (am I waiting for a doodle here???) and I could read the entire course worth of transcripts in under a half hour rather than go through all of the videos. And the recipes... good god! I don't think that someone interested in learning more about child nutrition is needing a slow tutorial on how to make basic oatmeal on the stove top.  If she'd upped the game- showed basics and then talked about the benefits of adding, say, chia seeds, different fruits, flax, etc. and how best to make a basic bowl of oatmeal into a complete breakfast, that would have been a useful topic.  I'm just hugely disappointed.

400490~COURSE!~iQZflcZ7EeOoFhIxOQQuEA,1515102490218,3,0,"The course is good, but it is incredibly basic. Perhaps for the average American it may be excellent content, but for anybody even minimally knowledgeable in nutrition everything is already well known (even the deceptive way grocery stores lay out their floorplans and shelve their products). I completed the whole course in a couple of hours (watching the videos at 2x which already felt ""too slow"" and required me to skip ahead not to fall asleep). I don't think I learnt anything from it which I did not know already from my mandatory nutrition class which I took in high school. But I grew up decades ago in a different country, so things may be different now and/or for people who grew up in the USA. Our family already cooks most of its meals home, we always eat together every dinner (and when schedule allows breakfast and lunch too), and we drink only water -- so I can relate with the teacher stressing these aspects, but again, this is like saying water is wet for me.From Stanford, I was expecting something more sophisticated. For example regarding the 9 essential aminoacids: what are the recommended daily quantities for kids, which food contains them in which quantities, is it possible to have a balanced diet for a kid which is vegetarian or even vegan? If yes, how? If not why (in detail)? Not just a in passing mention of the timeworn beans-and-corn.So in conclusion, my low rating is probably more of the result of my unmet expectations (previous paragraph) than an actual lack of the course itself (first paragraph). Probably a title such as ""Home Cooking for Healthy Children"" (or anything similar avoiding the word ""nutrition"", which implies a  more scientific content), would have set my expectations right (and I would not have wasted my time on it).",0,0,Davide Del Vento,400490

This one is well done, and manages to be scientifically based and yet the material is presented in an approachable way.  The drawings are a great way to engage.  I convinced my daughter to take the course, and my grand-daughter is watching the videos, too.  She loves the drawings.  I also think the cooking style is great, teaching HOW to cook instead of being reliant on recipes, and keeping measurements approximate.   That's how my grandmother taught me.  Including gluten free and vegetarian recipes and nutritional content, as well as addressing food allergies, makes the course inclusive.  I like the contextualizing of nutrition information with suggestions on eating as a family, cooking and gardening with kids, and being mindful of environmental impacts of food production.  The last week's inclusion of the layers of support for healthy children was an added bonus, and important to think about when so much effort goes into keeping children healthy at home, yet so much of our politics and use of resources doesn't support health, safety and well-being.  Only 2 things didn't seem right.  One, rinsing fish. Didn't think that was necessary. Googling it, I see it's controversial!!   Definitely is contrary to all I've heard to say that wine retains alcoholic content after cooking! (Stew recipe) I've shared this class on Facebook a few times.  I get very frustrated hearing people say, 'how do you know who to listen to about nutrition,' and it doesn't seem to be commonly known that there is science behind it.  Also, that common sense and confidence go a long way in cooking.  I think it's a good class for adults who are only feeding themselves!   And finally, the kids are adorable.  I'm looking forward to the student-submitted recipes.  Thanks so much!",0,4,Pamela J. Richmond,7453860

With a balance of facts with practical tips, this course avoids a lot of the extremes seen in most discussions on nutrition. Biggest takeaways:* The food that spoils the quickest is the best for us because the nutrients that pests want are the nutrients that we want too. As much as possible, choose unprocessed foods.* While this course is agnostic in terms of vegetarian or carnivorous diets, it suggests that most Americans eat more meat than is healthy for them and the environment.* As much as possible, eat a rainbow. Variety is key to getting a complete variety of the nutrients we need.* Plate size matters a lot* The fresher and more local your produce, the better it is for you and the environment.* Drink water and a lot of it",0,3,Natalie Doud,5591887
