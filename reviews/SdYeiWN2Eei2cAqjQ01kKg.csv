60203669~COURSE!~SdYeiWN2Eei2cAqjQ01kKg,1654231182717,1,0,"Quiz questions often presented prior to introduction of information, misspellings in course materials, and required to watch 2 long interviews with a sweaty, greasy haired, orange toothed insurance head complaining about how the Affordable Care Act victimized fat cats like himself. You aren't able to review quiz answers you missed, robbing students of opportunities to learn. There are also required readings that demand payment to view. I appreciated the instructor's passion, but compared to other courses - which include study materials, the chance to learn from quiz mistakes, and the ability to review both of the aforementioned after completing the course - this was a laborious chore. PLUS it asks for a 2-page paper at the end, which lends to the sense that the course is more interested in being punitive and difficult than accessible, engaging, or educational.
