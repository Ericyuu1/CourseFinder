114511707~COURSE!~-SxQTiRvEeeThwpZEliGsA,1665595804930,1,0," D​O NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!  TIS COURSE IS A JOKE.  It is contingent upon peer review graded assignments without a set number of learners or a finite timeline, such in a regular classroom setting.   You could be waiting weeks or months for a graded assignment and can NOT progress through the material until it is graded.  The other graders might not fully understand or comprehend the assignments as it pertains to the lecture material.  Look at the discussion board and it will show that some people have been waiting years to get their grade and complete course.  The only reason I gave it a one star is because it is an interesting subject.  However how the course is set-up in COURSERA needs to be completely redesigned.",0,1,Matthew Coles,114511707

8175156~COURSE!~-SxQTiRvEeeThwpZEliGsA,1619601543391,1,0,"Uses many progress blocking peer reviews (1 in week 1, then 2 every week). But because there are very few students, the effect is every peer review is a 10 day wait because there are no peers.It will cost you 7 times 10 days waiting for a mere 8 hours of study. Do not enroll. ",0,3,Rutger Spaans,8175156

Although the peer-review process was a huge disadvantage, many people were mean or evaluated correct answers as wrong, and thus it is possible to have significant delays in finishing the course.

52312516~COURSE!~-SxQTiRvEeeThwpZEliGsA,1591594547128,5,0,"I personally really enjoyed taking this course overall, and I think it's for anyone who's interested in subjects such as video games. design, and avatar psychology itself of course. It really opened my eyes on how designing avatars linked together with real-life aspects of history, language and culture, resulting in various interactions for all kinds of users imaginable. You have to take the quizzes, complete the given assignments and interact with your peers in order to get the best full grade possible, and it really helped that it was all put together by a kind, funny and helpful professor who is passionate with teaching the aspects of psychology combined with avatars and design. So do I recommend this course? Yes, I do recommend it to anyone who is interested in these things, and I hope you found this review to be beneficial. Thanks for reading, and take care.
