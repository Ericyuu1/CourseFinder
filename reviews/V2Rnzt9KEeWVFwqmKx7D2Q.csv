79786297~COURSE!~V2Rnzt9KEeWVFwqmKx7D2Q,1659247906920,3,0,"There is a lot to learn in this course, and a lot of complex coding needed if you complete the coding exercises. I am not sure how well anyone would get on without a solid coding background. Taken separately, there are the course videos, and the Stepik based coding activities. The videos are very good, and I think are a must for getting an overview of the course teaching. The stepik coding activiites have taught material which re-covers the videos in text for, BUT there is something of a disconnect between the two - almost like someone updated one but not the other? Or that the two production teams didnt talk? So be prepared to work your way through some confusion in that area. There are also considerable variances ad inconsistancis as you go through Skepic week by week - again subtle chnages that are not always flagged - again sugesting partial either poor proof reading or un synchronised changes over time. In a less complex course (both biologically and computationally) one would quickly resolve these  - but when the core material itself is challenging this become an unnecessary frustration. There is a studnt discussion forum for each activity, and this can be helpful - but one needs to sort the wha=eat from the chaff - some is helpful and correct, other contributions plain wrong! Although there is a lot of this contribution, it is now quite dated - so dont expect a prompt response to any questions you raise.Finally a major area of frustration for me was debugging my code. Often a pseudo-code algortihm is provided, and test data, but for the most complex coding assignments simply being told that the answer is wrong, with no indication as to why, is a problem - particulalrly when it appears that the grader is very sensitive to things like spaces and new lines in your response!Bottom line - the video teaching is interesting and informative, the coding challenges not for the faint hearted, be preapred to work through ambibuous and inconsistant instructions - and probably best to read all the discussion forums for the known 'gotchas' before you start codning and testing the programming activities.",0,2,David Bush,79786297

The course contains examples data and codes for analysing genome assembly. The challenge is that many example codes are difficult for beginners, and some of the algorithms are hard to interpret. I wonder weather the instructors can provide more clues and toy example codes for beginners. I believe that the course will attract more and more people if there are more specific examples and more deep about the real data sets in bioinformatics. Because there is still a challenge for us to write our own scripts for construct a genome even we have finished the course. Of course, maybe the aim of this course is just give students a general outlook of genome assembly. Anyone, This course is wonderful and there still a lot of improvement in this class.

The  video lectures by the young professor finally helped me to understand what was going on. I have the book, so the online shortened version is not very helpful, but the videos are generally very good.
