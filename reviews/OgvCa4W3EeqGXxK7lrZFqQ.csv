I experience a few issues that prevent me from giving this course five stars. First, I could not access many of the Forbes and Harvard Business Review articles, as I read over my limit and would have thus needed to pay for subscriptions to access course material. Second, I did not feel valued or respected when I took time to write substantive responses for quizzes and activities and simply got an automated ""correct"" answer. That was kind of invalidating. I also found the discussion board to lack substance. Many folks seemed to offer short, surface level responses. I wonder how more actual engagement between participants and instructor and participants and participants might have boosted my learning. Overall, however, a very helpful course. I am super glad I took it and appreciate Brenda Allen taking time to develop and deliver this course!  Again, I learned so much that I know I will apply to administration at my university.

Dr. Allen's explanations are superb and very accessible for all, dominant and non-dominant. The explanation of privilege gave a whole new meaning to the word and greatly expanded my view beyond the most common, white heterosexual male. Often, WHM are offended when it's suggested they have privilege. Dr. Allen's explanation of privilege takes away that feeling and makes us realize the vast majority of us are privileged in some way. The discussions of microaggressions was very meaningful. All HR staff should be required to hear this and read the course material so they will never again say to an employee, ""What's the big deal? Nothing was meant by that."" The resource material is rich, deep and plentiful. It's also very current.
