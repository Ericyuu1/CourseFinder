First, lecture slides are incredibly text heavy and the voice over simply reads this to you.  This is not engaging and it is power point 101 to NOT fill your slides with text.  Second, the quizzes include questions that don't relate to any of the lecture material and are worded in a very convoluted way.  I copied text from the text question and went back and searched the entire course and did not find those words or phrases.  Worst of all, when you get a question wrong in a quiz, they don't tell you the correct answer.  There is no explanation at all of why the answer was wrong.  You can re-take the quiz but again are just randomly selecting an answer without understanding why a particular answer is right or wrong.  This is another basic tenet of being an educator - help students understand their mistakes and how to arrive at the correct answer.  I've taken Mental Health First Aid trainings through my employer and my city and they are MUCH better, more engaging, easier to follow, more useful.  ",0,1,Meredith Tee,81858748

52865330~COURSE!~hbvvfJLaEeWBSw79YYA_8Q,1589152594074,1,0,"This course contained some interesting material.  However the main video case study I thought was pointless because it involved interviews with people well after an event, who had clearly had plenty of time to process their experiences (and seemed to have done a great job at doing so).  How is this hindsight approach relevant to providing immediate first aid?  I also found the dramatised videos featuring George really cringy. He started 'engaging' with the client before offering a chair, a drink and something to eat! Sometimes I felt what he said was actually presumptuous, eg telling her that there were other ways to keep the memories, instead of asking her for her own ideas on how to do this. It also appalled me that he accepted that she would revisit the house but didn't ask her if she had a family member or friend to go with her.  It might not even have been safe to go back, but he didn't seem to think of that!  So maybe this course partly didn't work for me because I am British and we have cultural differences in how we handle crises and emotions. We offer hospitality and time first and don't interrogate people. But I also felt on a fundamental level it didn't emphasise basic agency and choice nearly enough. And finally, to the lecturer, I would say that there's no need to repeatedly say that you've been doing something for 40 years. Disappointing.",0,21,Sarah Tibbatts,52865330

Though the explanation of the RAPID model was adequate, I don't think the assessments were consistent with the material (mentioning a topic in a slide is not discussing it).  When taking the assessment, if I get a wrong answer, explain why it's wrong in the review.  Let the assessment continue to be a learning tool - otherwise it's trial and error.  I thought the videos were incredibly outdated and showed little practical application.  The vignettes were probably the most helpful, however I don't feel adequately prepared for deployment.

I believe most of the important topics were explained, and in an appropriate manner. Some of the tools presented were new to me, and that was good. However, I think the course had flaws, especially topics that were not looked at, and that I believe are essential, even for a rudimentary course. These are: How does PFA change when dealing with children? Children tend to be ignored in many studies and fields, and this course makes no difference for PFA with children, who will not understand the same things adults will, or respond in the same ways. The approach must be changed (usage of playful activities as a means of assessment, and psychoeducadtion of their parents or tutors, for example).Along that same line, how does PFA change when dealing with other populations with different characteristics, and perhaps, higher vulnerabilities? Elderly populations, people with cognitive or physical disabilities, empoverished communities, people already dealing with loss and mourning, for example. This does include gender specifics by case: are there any differences when dealing with men or women, being a man or woman yourself? Or any other gender you or the other person identifies with.There should be a huge emphasis on differences in the approach by culture - cultural sensibility. The course seems to be western-centric, and makes no emphasis on the differences of people in different cultures, when that is a factor that affects the whole lifestyle of the person, and should be on the radar of the person giving PFA. At least a note should be made to remind students that this is an important factor that should be looked into in every event.Aspects in the shape of PFA. What about physical contact? How should you gesture to show empathy? Tone of voice, sitting position, eye contact, note taking, possibility of doing PFA in pairs or group settings, etc.? In this regard, I will assume that the fact he was acting had an effect on George´s performance, but his responses with Gina seemed mechanical and cold.Connecting the person to other people. Should you, and how should you talk to the person´s social support network (in the case that that is a possibility), as well as other people that might help them.I also think a basic course on PFA should delve somewhat deeper in the intervention and follow up parts. It seemed too rush. I would prefer a course that was slightly longer to be able to do that.Again, it was satisfactory.

for the tests.  Although I passed all courses on the first try (I do have
a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology), there were questions on the first test that
asked us to regurgitate unimportant statistics from a meta-analysis mentioned
in passing.  Other questions on other tests expect us to have magically
absorbed material that was never presented in any lectures or
simulations.  (For example, on the last test we were expected to know that
chronic fatigue is a symptom of burnout, even though it is not among the nine
symptoms of burnout listed in the lecture.)  The professor has obviously
not looked at the tests in a very long time, nor has he proof-read the
""transcripts"" of his lectures (where, for example, we read the word
""queues"" when what he said was ""cues,"" among numerous
other mistakes).  Overall, the tests do a poor job evaluating whether
or not the learner has grasped the key concepts and procedures that are the
most important parts of the course.  There are too many ""GOTCHA!""
questions, apparently dreamed up by some sadistic graduate student, designed less to assess than to
confuse.  As such, the tests could very easily ""gaslight"" the
learner into believing that she or he has not learned these concepts and
procedures, the very ones the professor intends for the learner to absorb,
when in fact the learner HAS absorbed them!  The fact that the course,
according to the professor, is designed for firefighters and police officers
and others without any background in mental health, only increases the probability
of this ""gaslighting"" effect.  These four tests are, to put it kindly, sub-optimal.",0,2,Gordon Smith,70293473

One should treat this course purely as that, and introduction which is what I was chasing.  Further learning and experience would be needed if you want to apply PFA completely yourself.  That said it does give you snippets of useful actions/responses that can be applied in general life.The presenter is very articulate and pleasant to listen to.In regards to the presentation of the material a couple of comments. 1. The simulation videos are a good attempt to demonstrate how, and how not to, engage.  They are simplistic / sanitized to a fair degree without considering a lot of other environmental factors  (like pople showing real distress in background perhaps, a setting that isnt so clean and ordered, dealing with kids, seeing physical injuries etc)  BUT to do so could have drawn attention away from the core basic message. 2. The main case study type video.  The issue of it being old is not a problem, but it didnt involve actualy discussions with people immediately after the event, rather these were all some time after the event.  These people have moved on (one way or another) from PFA already.3. Speaking of Videos.  Although lecturer introduces each lecture on video himeslef, the main lecture videos are just going through slides.  This is less engaging4. The content was good for a first timer.A number of others reviews have given a more detailed critique of where the course should have gone.

Perhaps this is more a topic for a next level course - but I think it's really important. A lot of well meaning people aren't necessarily the best at recognizing the signs, especially when subtle, that someone is decompensating and/or escalating, which can happen quickly. This would serve as a juxtaposition to the existing case, which is great. I also wish there was a follow-up breakdown video about the chosen triage for the ""Ashes"" folks, I think that would be the most helpful for those of us who already have some experience in this realm. Admittedly, as someone with very limited free time I did the whole course in one day, instead of over weeks, so perhaps that would be what comes up in the forum. But I was hoping for a breakdown of that video specifically, which I think would have been excellent to watch. Perhaps that's a next-level item as well, but...So I'm hoping you will make an advanced course or point to resources that can provide next level training. I've done some of the FEMA courses but would love more geared toward this in particular. Given my training, I may be more likely to be someone they escalate to, and offering a course for those who oversee people doing frontline PFA could be helpful. ",0,5,Erin Weaver,50520752

felt that the course provided a very good overview of the Johns Hopkins model,

the course provides the skeleton of PFA, but could benefit from fleshing it out

I myself am a trained nurse who had also been helping refugees in Calais/ France in 2015 together with other volunteers from all of Europe - I wish the information in this course would have been available both to students of nursing and volunteers begofe deployment.
Considering my background the course level was at some points too simple for me, but that is to ensure people with any form of background can follow it. Also, due to own health issues of mine which have made it impossible for me to keep working as a nurse and to take part in interventions in recent years it took me more than a year to finish this course, so it is has been quite a challenge for me. One that reactivates my optism since I see that I can still study even onder this circumstances and who knows one day I might be able to help others again thanks to this course. 
I want to thank the John Hopkins University for providing this course on Coursea, open to everyone.

84845651~COURSE!~hbvvfJLaEeWBSw79YYA_8Q,1621997470990,5,0,"The course is actually quite an excellent rudimentary introduction to PFA and the RAPID model. It may disappoint those seeking a much more detailed presentation of the stages in PFA ie reflective listening, assessment and prioritisation, etc. The course focused on the PFA practitioner's ability to establish a real connection with the survivor through a very basic primal understanding of compassion. This may be trivial or obvious for many, especially those with psychology backgrounds, but I cannot express enough how lacking this is amongst so many in the field.

 is a useful, introductory resource for identifying and using this methodology during emergency resource surge moments. This course features weekly slideshow lecture recordings, demonstration videos, and multiple choice exam assessments. For learners sensitive to descriptions of natural disasters or human death, they may want to skip this training. For learners seeking information about this non-clinical methodology, either as administrators or practitioners creating or implementing a program, this course is an excellent overview of the labor involved as well as practitioner outcomes assessment. I particularly appreciated the pedagogical design to practice new skills in steps. Initially, during the introduction, a ""good practice"" demonstration is provided before weekly dissecting the elements of ""good practice"". First, slideshows describe high-order issues. Next, a ""bad practice"" example is performed. Then, learners are invited to identify and describe bad practice. Next, ""good practice"" is modeled and summarized.",0,0,Salvatore De Sando,68107324

The instructor was excellent in explaining the concepts and the vignettes exceedingly very well.  I have had resiliency courses and this shows a different side of resiliency training. The most poignant aspect of the training is that people who help people do not conduct Self-Care. This training emphasizes Self-Care in detailed form and shows how essential it is for everyone, most especially people who care for others. I am very happy that I took the course. I have never paid attention to Self-Care until now.  This is because it has never been explained as well as Dr George Beverly, Jr. in this course by using it as ""Dr. George Beverly, Jr's Burn-out Club"" . This is a brilliant idea on Dr. Beverly Jr's part to drum in the importance of self-care with the aspect of the club. This method hits 'home' for everyone.

There's also a simulation video of what the process can look like, which accompanies the whole course and ties it together nicely. There's also videos of how not to do it. I found the quality of the videos/acting to be almost perfect, and certainly excellent! :-)I can not praise the instructor enough, his long experience in the field has certainly honed his social skills, like compassion and connecting with other people. That comes through in the lectures and intro videos as well as the simulation. It's a helpful to have someone to look at and think: ""This is how I could also be one day, this I could strive for.""Content-wise, the lectures are to-the-point and not too long, sometimes I would have liked more detail but mostly they were just right for me.The
 tests are brief and aim at you understanding the core concepts and 
knowing some relevant data. The questions can be quite specific, so you 
need to pay attention to details throughout the course, however, it is only details actually relevant to the topic that you need to know.
I got a sense that this course was compiled in a thoughtful and ""heartful"" way. Some minor room for small improvements aside here and there, overall, I found it a course of an outstanding quality content-wise, and of significant helpfulness for me, who was wholly new to the topic.
 I'm glad I took the course, as it was the right decision for me, and I feel significantly better equipped than before to help others. I now have a solid basic understanding and a useful overview of Psychological First Aid.

63204101~COURSE!~hbvvfJLaEeWBSw79YYA_8Q,1594561795419,5,0,"I am from Kerala, India. In my country, psychological first aid [PFA] is just a fancy term. On the wake of disasters like megafloods, earthquakes and other natural and man-made calamities, financial and medical aid is provided by the state and central governments. Usually, there is no acknowledgement of the 'surge' that happens after a disaster. I have understood it from personal experience during the megafloods in Kerala in 2018. Although I was not a direct victim of the floods, I tried to contribute to the displaced and the disaster-stricken demographic. This experience gave me the insights that PFA is non-existent in these contexts, here. The medical team at a disaster spot would ideally treat the physical ailments of the people, the officials would mitigate the financial losses of the people, there is no reference or acknowledgement of the psychological trauma an individual undergoes during these calamities. There is no one-on-one care to the individual who undergoes the ordeal. I wrote a book titled LIFE AFTER THE FLOODS: REFLECTIONS ON KERALA FLOODS, which was published in 2019 by Kalamos Literary Services in Delhi highlighting these issues and the necessity to provide a mental support system to the victims of calamities. The PFA course run by Johns Hopkins University is a boon to people from my place, for health workers, first responders and others. I found it as an answer to the many questions I raised in my book Life After the Floods. I am especially in love with the lectures given by Prof. Geroge Everly. His compassionate eyes have the power to teach us how to help others and to help ourselves. This course offered me a highly valuable tool to deal with individuals who are facing psychological challenges during a disaster.

I want to be best able to help my family, my neighbors, and my greater community, when disaster strikes. I've lived through Loma Prieta, and I had responsibility as a Resident Assistant, and we were poorly prepared. Thankfully, there was no physical harm to any in my care, but this psychological piece was missing for me, and for my residents, and my fellow staff. And, I can do what this course asks. My biggest problem in a local emergency will be the lack of a robust public health infrastructure, so I will need to work with my sponsoring agency to see about our referral resources, for those needing more care.  And, the section on self care is important, as I will be likely impacted by any disaster where I deploy since I am a CERT member, a member of the Community. Thank you sir.

When saw what Dr. Everly was presenting, I immediately grimaced. But, I re-framed my thinking. God willing I would have to go through a disaster like Parkland or any other traumatic experience, and I hope I never would have to use the skills learnt from this course in any setting. However, in dealing with teens, a lot of situations may seem distressing. Although trivial to adults, a lot of problems to teens are magnified. So it is important not just for PFA but also anyone who works with people to go through phases of RAPID especially reflective listening and not offer responses designed to quickly solve the problem. In addition, it is also important to recognize we need to ""self-care"". I have met educators who take on the burden of students' personal issues too seriously and enter into unhealthy living habits. It is important to care for people, but establish boundaries. In addition, it is also important to get an assessment and not steer students(I have met teachers who have tried to steer students to talk about issues which were personal and incredibly traumatic without knowing how to be a facilitator of being part of a 'next level' of help. ) into answering questions which may open the proverbial Pandora's Box.

I appreciated all of the models but particularly appreciated the one on self-care--a thing I have had to learn, and continue to do so, to manage PTSD. I can't emphasize strongly enough myself how vital self-care is--whether it is meditation or prayer, proper sleep and/or an eye on healthy eating, finding that friend/family member/coworker to confide in or rant to--it's the case of, to use the airplane safety analogy, ""giving oneself the mask first"".

It is important to raise awareness of compassionate social support for people in need, which this course certainly does. RAPID model is proved to be efficient and easy to implement. I personally value the Self-care section, as I often find myself overwhelmed with other people's negative experiences and I tend to over empathize with them. Another useful tip, especially for therapists and/or psychologists as myself, is not to diagnose or provide therapeutic intervention. It is good to keep that in mind during PFA, because it can do more damage than good.

I would recommend it as a set of self skills for individuals to be able to use it to help themselves and their local community. The main point is that Psychological First Aid is not therapy and an individual is not attempting to diagnose a person, they're working to help be a touchstone during a point of crisis in life to help focus a person onto a path of recovery and provide information and resources as needed. Even for anyone that is looking to study more Psychological or Mental Health courses, this is a good addition to help add to that knowledge base. The course is nicely spaced out so as not to be overwhelming whether one is taking it by itself or along with other courses at the same time. The break down of examples through the video simulations allows for a better grasp of right and wrong applications for the use of the RAPID model. Plus it provides a progressive flow to digest each section over the course of 5 weeks for the RAPID model in application and practice.",0,5,Marilyn Kristina Morgan,7005734

Maybe it could be offered in more languages – at least with subtitles – so more people would benefit from it.  Although I had not had any previous   experience with PFA, I am pretty sure that I had been trying to find this field of knowledge for a long time… I am a psychologist (with a Psychosociological orientation) from Brazil and I have been working with human rights and community development in different settings and projects for the last 15 years also in other countries for short periods.  During the first simulation video, I was really touched, especially because I realized that I had found something that made complete sense to me as a psychologist, especially when our mentor stressed “it’s not therapy”.  I am not a clinical psychologist and I did not come across these techniques and studies while I was at the university, and when I pictured myself working with refugees or the people at my city – I realized that we can apply PFA not only to people at catastrophes, but also to people living in very violent areas in some parts of Rio de Janeiro or São Paulo. Before the course, I was not satisfied with my resources to work in some settings: “Am I going to provide psychological therapy? No, it is not what I do”. But the PFA, yes, that I can picture myself doing it and have been doing something similar all my life. So, all I can say is Thank you, I will dive in.

It had broken a paradigm that the PFA it's not therapy! I had a idea that PFA was a sort of psychoteraphy, but I have learned that is not true. Some topics have helped me to better internalize psychology concepts more consciously like the reflective listening that is crucial for any type of mental health intervention.
I was surprised when I saw the study where it was proven that the PFA it's more effective than multisession psychoteraphy. Well, it was a course where I had a huge learning. Thank you teacher Everly!",0,0,Julio César Nunes Ito,13417395

Like to have had George's thought's on this. Also perhaps one video going through the whole process from beginning to end would have helped show a complete model.
