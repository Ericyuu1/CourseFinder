While the exposure to the tool and accompanying online communities was interesting, fun, and good Tableau practice, Courses 1 and 2 could be covered in 1 week; at times it felt like a Tableau infomercial. We never dug deeper than what Tableau does- no examples or practice on how to use it. This course doesn't stand up to the quality of content and teaching in other coursera courses I've taken including 'Learn SQL Basics for Data Science Specialization' and 'Excel Skills for Data Analytics and Visualization' - I highly recommend these courses. Based on reviews for the 3rd Tableau class I will not be continuing with the Tableau Specialization.
