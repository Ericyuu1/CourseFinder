9024138~COURSE!~JGtykBMMEe2zqRIXQVOwlw,1673630648976,3,0,"First half of the course was very good.  Second half of the course was lacking in clear instruction where the instructor would reference charts and tables and graphs and nearly every instance there was no image during the video instruction or within the class notes.  In addition, the team assignments were not graded that I know of.  We were told to submit one copy for the team so our team lead did, but no scores showed up for the other team members.  What's the point of having a team assignment that is not going to be checked and get feedback from?   Hopefully they fix these issues.  ",0,0,Jared Shaw,9024138
