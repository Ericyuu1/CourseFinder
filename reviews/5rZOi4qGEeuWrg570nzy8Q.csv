47884666~COURSE!~5rZOi4qGEeuWrg570nzy8Q,1676040464683,1,0,"Professor is teaching too little material, students cannot only refer the lectures to do the homework,  in order to finish the homework students need to spend extra time to search for the right material. I suggest the course should include a homework session that help students to finish the homework. Overall i think this course is horrible because the professor only covers very limited materials.",0,0,Brian Chun,47884666

Some problem, grader won't accept correct answer which give much confusion to learner and beginner, plus don't have any official TA here.  Students have to help each other and it is not effective. However, content inside course is good. Recommend for looking for the lecture but not recommend if you expect specialization. There will be a few people in last course and no TA help you there!!",0,0,Jirayu Supasil,21093149
