For people that understand the mathematics it won't go deep enough/not explain a lot of the things in depth. The depth fits better with someone that doesn't understand the mathematics, but they won't be able to follow the mathematics. In short, I don't understand who this course is meant for, definitely not for me. The level of the content seems to me like perhaps third year of a Bachelor's or undergrad degree. If you do not have some background in mathematics, don't take this course. It is way too easy to pass the quizzes. You just shouldn't be able to pass with 50%. Also, the presentations are often not very focused. Sometimes the teacher glosses over quite important things you need to really understand what's going on. However, sometimes a lot of time is spent explaining completely trivial things (at least they will be trivial to anyone that understands the rest of the course). I decided to also do a different course in this field, because I don't feel I learned that much here. I did a Physics bachelor's  and master's degree and am already proficient in MATLAB. It took me about 3-4 hours per week to learn the content and make the quiz in the first 8 weeks. If you want to really understand the content, you will have to find sources outside coursera as well. The last 4 weeks I got too annoyed with the presentations glossing over everything that I went through it more quickly. I do not recommend following this course. ",0,18,Bram Mooij,25594749

I would recommend it to anyone who wants to start studying image processing/computer vision, although linear algebra and digital signal processing are required prerequisites. There is only one drawback of this course I would like to mention. MATLAB tasks that start from week 6 are not as helpful as the previous ones were, because it only requires to put a few lines into already existing code or just change a value of  a variable there to complete it. I think, it would more useful to write a code on my own with thorough guides provided (as it had been prior to week 6). I know, it might be a bit hard but it's worth it. ",0,1,,38472082
