3007298~COURSE!~FGBjQVqVEeu3_xIeBrtbdw,1651416886013,5,0,"I enjoyed the course.  It provides a strong anti-racism perspective from people who strongly believe in the anti-racism concept.  I would have enjoyed a broader, more academic perspective on this issue, too, with a critique of anti-racism from multiple perspectives including those who are more critical of the concept.",0,0,Steven Feldman,3007298
