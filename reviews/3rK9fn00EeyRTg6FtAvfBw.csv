104336845~COURSE!~3rK9fn00EeyRTg6FtAvfBw,1667152917125,5,0,"I​ was involved in M&A activities a few times in my 30yr career in the technology sector, but always on the technical side. The course material delivered by Heitor Almeida not only has substantial level of detail with great excel support files, but it had a good impact in my ability to undertand several aspects related to failure and successes of the deals I was involved with, including a hostile takeover by one of my previous employers. The material also helped me underdstand the stock market behavior after M&A deals are announced whether the target is public or private enterprise. I highly recommend this course for young finance or technology professionals who wish to improve their understanding of inorganic product growth or M&A strategies.",0,0,Toucan Square,104336845

99644311~COURSE!~3rK9fn00EeyRTg6FtAvfBw,1660823619349,5,0,"A complete course to understand about valuation, mainly if you want to begining from the basics. I think that course will help my career! I  only suggest a little change about Honors Assignment avaliation method because the students just avaliate themselves work to obtain them honors instead really avaliate if your valuation has justified assumptions, for example: my file was completely organized and clear, but in the first attempt of honors, a student avaliated my file was a mess. Then, I think that a different avaliation method can make this course better, like a automatic avaliation or professor's correction. Anyway, thank you, professor Almeida!
