title of this MOOC: ""Python and machine learning for asset
management"". I recognize that the ideas and applications of machine
learning proposed are interesting and deserve more study beyond the course, but
the content is not adequate for the title.    Some concepts are reasonably explained, but
if you did not study anything about machine learning, it will be hard to grasp
the opportunities for using ML in finance. So, before taking this course I
recommend you do a machine learning course, especially Prof. Ng's course of
Machine Learning from Stanford, where all the concepts are clearly developed
and explained through 11 or 12 weeks. It is not based on Python, but once you
understand the principles it will be easier to implement it at other languages.   Despite it
is a Python course, I think it is possible to complete it without even knowing
Python. Even though the PhD students made excellent notebooks and
presentations, they barely explained Scikit Learn modules. You can complete
this course without writing a single script using model selection,
preprocessing, pipeline and many other useful modules from Scikit Learn. For
instance, you do not need to write a single script to fit a linear regression.
How can you expect to apply what you have learned? Resuming my
review, this course does not deliver what it should. The scripts were developed
in Python, but if you are not familiar with Scikit Learn, I doubt you can apply
the skills you’ve just learned. This subject requires a lot of study and
especially practice, but this course does little to reduce this gap. At most,
it could be scattered along the other courses of this specialization, like
bonuses lectures and labs with ideas about applying machine learning in finance.",0,0,Angelo Freitas,12760345

However, learning was not organized. This course is third in the series but has
the lowest rating for a reason. I will summarize the pros and cons and provide
a roadmap to improve it.Pros: a)     
The academic referenced material is rigorous and
requires familiarity with both investments and machine learning topics. This course
is certainly not for a beginner. However, having gone through two courses
before, one should be reasonably prepared.b)     
This course surely provided ML code that can be
expanded to conduct further research. As others have said, this course offers building
blocks for ML in the asset management area. However, it does not deliver a finished
(or semi-finished product).c)     
It provides ML code, which most learners cannot develop
on their own.Cons:a)     
Too many cooks in the kitchen. Two instructors and five
PhD students is a lot to create confusion among labs, videos, and quizzes.
There is inconsistency in each week and across weeks. b)     
After going through the first two courses (with just two
instructors), the bar is set high. Unfortunately, the bar could not be met.c)     
Quizzes are horrible. They are vague and unrelated to
labs. In the first two courses, lab content was tested heavily. Here concepts
are tested. Quizzes need to be rebuilt.Improvements:1)     
Have only one person present (possibly develop) all the
labs (like Vijay did in the first two). Then consistency will be maintained.2)     
Have quizzes based on labs (not theory). Or make it 80%
lab, 20% theory. Currently, quizzes are 80% theory. 3)

At first one might think that the videos and quizzes in the material gives an first impression and introduction to the topics and that the course ends there, after having completed the quizzess and earned the necessary points for graduating. But, by spending more time actually reading into the suggested research papers, thoroughly going through all the great material (data, notebooks, academic papers) that the team at Princeton and Edhec has been so kindly to provide, the full benefits of taking this course really starts kicking in. I felt a I got a real good introduction to the topics from the videos and quizzes, but as a full-time finance professional, the greatest benefit has been the extensive amount of supporting material that I still use and come back to, to gain new perspectives and inspiration that I can learn from and utilize in my own work!

43994555~COURSE!~ODu2f8yZEeisGBKHn9j58A,1623222620860,5,0,"A​ccording to risk.net, Princeton University (Bendheim Center for Finance) is the best school in the world in the field of quantitative finance and the content of the course was very rich in my opinion, especially with that recently updated/added lab session. I would like to appreciate that new content. But there are a  few problems for students that can be easily solved. The first problem is that some questions in the quizzes are confusing and there is nothing in the course material regarding them. The second problem is that some of the references, especially papers and reports are not available easily for further study. On MOOC1 and MOOC2 we don't have this problem. The third problem is that the students need more in-depth training on the ML techniques used in the course as most of them are new to ML field. Referring to a book is not a good way of training. The fourth problem is about the Labs. The course Labs need someone like Vijay as was in MOOC 1 and 2. These points are from a lazy student's perspective. I, personally believe that course is very rich as it presents real applications of the finance world and students can gain a lot if they consider the course demanding their further effort on learning ML and playing around with the data and codes. So, if we consider the course demanding which is not possible for every student, It is a perfect complement for MOOC1 and 2. So, I would like to thank you professor Mulvey, and lovely Lionel. Students should be grateful to you. In the end, I would like to ask this course developers to add more real applications to the course.
