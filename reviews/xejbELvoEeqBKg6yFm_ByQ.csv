67775814~COURSE!~xejbELvoEeqBKg6yFm_ByQ,1600003591287,5,0,"As others wrote, the course itself and the explanations are very good, as the introduction course. The last topics about OOP and GUI were a little bit challenging, because there were only quizzes (which are not really helpful for better understanding, I think, because they are very theoretical) and no exercises as before, where you can learn how to write the code in ""smaller"" steps. Also, the explanations of the code in the videos felt a little bit fast sometimes (*click* ""there is the new code""), but I understand, that it has to be shortened because of the length of the videos (which were longer than in the first course). The final project was really challenging at first, because I misunderstood the details on how to implement the objects and functions. After some time I tried it without thinking too much about the exact wording of the task and tried to just extract and plot the data (without the GUI), which helped a lot.All in one, very nice advanced course and interesting topics, and, as before, fun to watch! 5/5",0,1,Mara Luisa Hochstein,67775814
