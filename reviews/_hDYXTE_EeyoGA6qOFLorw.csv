The multiple practices quizzes aided me in putting the content into practice, and allowed me to decipher what I comprehended versus what I didn't. Finally, the perspective that he offered ultimately gave me insight on what a truly ethical leader is, and has ultimately made me into one. Thank you! ",0,0,Trinity Brown,108938482
