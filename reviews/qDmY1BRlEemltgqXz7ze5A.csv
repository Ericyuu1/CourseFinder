Having issues or problems? They don't bother. Not a single reply from either instructor in the forums for months or years. Second: Flawed and inprecise notebooks. Well known issues with random numbers, but no updates. Incorrect book references which will let you implement formulas other than intended. Third: Tons of short videos with 30% summary and ""what you will learn"", which is ridiculous for 3 minute videos. Fourth reason: Mathematical depth missing after the first subcourse. Suggestion: Watch the David Silver and Stanford youtube lessons instead. For free and better explained.

9428817~COURSE!~qDmY1BRlEemltgqXz7ze5A,1627634108262,2,0,"The course was disappointing for two reasons: poor instruction and poor content. I was expecting a high quality course from Coursera, but was instead finding myself with instructors that simply read a textbook to you.  The instructors did not provide any added value. They read the book, even used the exact same examples and slides as in the book. Moreover, this was done in a a boring monotone way. The instructors seemed frozen still, eyes glazed over (with boredom?) with the exception of their lips that moved as they read the slides. 

Good instruction includes giving more value than just reading a book: new and different examples, different explanations, or at least different wording, personal commentary, sharing own intuition, and linking material to the broader world, making connections between ideas. All of this was missing.

Furthermore, the course is not inclusive. The few examples that were chosen were applications to chess and golf. In other words, activities of the privileged few. RL is highly relevant in our world where AI solutions are springing up in all areas of life. There is a wealth of examples that are relatable to a wide variety of people. Instead, by choosing golf and chess, the instructors are alienating the majority of their students.  This is in stark contract to Coursera's own mission of expanding and promoting access to high quality education for ALL people regardless of their background (including socio-economic background).

The course could be improved by adding content (commentary, explanations, examples, discussions) that has not appeared in the book. Relating this content in a student friendly manner (not monotonically reading slides).  In short, the instructors should follow the basics of modern provably effective teaching practices.

Things will be very clear to the student if the build everything from scratch using the basic libraries. for eg. not using rl_glue, but coding up the environment, coding up the agent. Using abstraction is good, but for those who already know the things. Since this course is more about the fundamentals of RL, it should teach the basics of building environment, agent from scratch. Maybe we can use library once we have done it from scratch, like starting from week 3 or course 2.

I had long wanted to explore the field of reinforcement learning. Reinforcement Learning is one of the most beautiful discoveries in Machine Learning. It's fascinating to see how a simple idea such as the reward hypothesis is so powerful in practice. Hearing the dialogue between Rich Sutton and Andrew Barto was very inspiring. I look forward to taking more courses in this specialization and learning more about RL.

It was good to have the supplementary videos with other experts  - and great to watch Sutton and Barto just sat down being recorded having a retrospective conversation.

Big compliments to the course instructors for developing a truly insightful and challenging course. Out of all the specializations and courses I have done on Coursera, this definitely has been the most challenging and rewarding one. The use of a textbook in addition to the video and programming materials is a very useful approach - to get the most out of this course, I recommend everyone to study all the material in advance of the lectures. This really increases the added value of the course.As has been said by others, the capstone project (course 4) is the least developed. It is mostly a reiteration of videos from previous courses, and a few programming assignments (numbers 1 and 3 of which are very easy, whereas number 2 is very challenging). A drawback is that as the courses progress, but in particular in course 4, the programming exercises become quite mechanical, and mostly involve following specific instructions with a bit of debugging, without keeping proper sight of the bigger picture. Then again, I've felt this is the case for many courses in ML, and not particular to this course. At this point, I feel I have a pretty good understanding of the theoretical basis of RL, but I would definitely not be able to implement an RL agent independently. I guess with this basis in hand, it is now time for some more applied (self-)study in this domain. I have definitely become even more eager to do so. ",0,0,Roger Smeets,14699220

Assignments were reasonably difficult, but not overwhelmingly so.  Homeworks are designed to make sure you understand key concepts moreso than being vigilantly 'rigorous' for their own sake.  Emphasis of the class is making sure you understand fundamental concepts moreso than hacking your way into a working prototype of something.  While the class is designed to be easily digested, the material assumes a working knowledge of programming and mathematical formalism, so people without some background knowledge you might struggle to keep pace, even if the material is well designed.Also, like others have mentioned.......this class follows the book pretty carefully.

I have been learning RL for some time and it was hear that almost finally i can say that a lot of the concepts that were vague in my head became clearer. Also it made me look at the book of Sutton and Barto and found that it was a good experience. Maybe more examples and questions in between videos as in deeplearning.ai of Andrew NG could be good for keeping with the attention could be nice. Also maybe doing more programming exercises in between the ones we did in order to implement each step would be great. Thank you very much!!!!,0,0,Deleted Account,37155810
