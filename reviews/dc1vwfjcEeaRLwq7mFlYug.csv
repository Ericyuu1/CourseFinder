34763674~COURSE!~dc1vwfjcEeaRLwq7mFlYug,1599962069742,3,0,"This course content and instructions given were wonderful. It is exciting to learn more about VR social interactions. However, the content is apparently not updated to reflect changes in available Unity free assets (Raw Motion Capture not available anymore). And the animations given as part of course content was not enough.",0,3,Rhuta Joshi,34763674
6373277~COURSE!~dc1vwfjcEeaRLwq7mFlYug,1546631337480,3,0,"The difficulty ramped up way too hard from the last course to this one. I understand why participants should apply the learnings and make their own version but in this course I ended up having to watch the tutorials multiple times and just blindly follow along trying not to miss a single step that would make everything unusable. That process was not enjoyable, the theoretical videos were good though, as usual in this specialization.",0,4,Jonas Christen,6373277
2520~COURSE!~dc1vwfjcEeaRLwq7mFlYug,1520249545510,3,0,"As in other courses, great theoretical support, but not amazing practical one. The assignments  are not difficult and thank you for the scripts, but often things do  not work as in videos and it is absolutely not clear why. The forums  look almost dead, quite some questions are unanswered. Requirements for assignments are not completely clear, so peer students often just don't bother with building their projects as apps for hardware and offer to just play in unity window. Many frustrating things in organization details of this specialization courses =(",0,3,Tatiana Kartashova,2520

34453037~COURSE!~dc1vwfjcEeaRLwq7mFlYug,1604858158816,4,0,"Yet another excellent course from this VR specialization. I believe social VR is definitely one of the key aspects of VR in the future, and having a complete course dedicated to it is great!I loved learning about the theory of social interaction via VR. We don't think every day about what makes eyes blinking more or less realistic, how much eye contact we make during a conversation, or even what a comfortable social distance is. This course gives you all the key to think about and answer these questions.The project is a great opportunity to learn: it forces you to go on the internet and look for models that you can easily animate, even if you are not an animator. In the end, it is very gratifying to have a complete interaction with a virtual character, and to think that you did it.Unfortunately, I still think the way we share projects is not ideal: unity projects tend to be heavy. I think it would be better to share a build or an apk that we could download. Or share a video of what we created. Currently the worst part is downloading a unity project from another student, waiting ages to finish the download, unzip it, import it in Unity...Also a lot of students do not take the project seriously. I even had mine blatantly stolen and reuploaded without any modifications (the person did not even wait for at least 1 week to do it, and ended up having me as a reviewer...). Most projects I saw were rand unity games without any VR interaction implemented. And as usual forums are dead... After 4 courses in this specialization, I confess that I also got tired, and started also asking for reviews to be over this as fast as possible.",0,3,Ian Cherabier,34453037
