But what kept me going after failing a quiz for the nth time was that at the end of it I knew I'd be able to write a review and warn people and hopefully the course designers of this course.F​irst of, I fell in love with programming and Python in particular after completing the PY4E specialization (highly recommended!). That course does a great job testing your programming skills by letting you, well, uh, program. Also, it shows real-life application. This course instead seeks to bore you with dozens of useless quiz questions that have little to do with programming. Honestly, had this course been my introduction, I would have never continued in my programming journey. Imagine taking a literature class, and instead of being asked about themes and motifs, you're asked to count the word that occurs the most on page 97 of ""A Farewell To Arms"". Not really relevant, right? (btw. this would be a great programming question to show how useful dictionaries are).  I spent more time redoing quizzes than I did actually coding, which isn't really the point of a course like this. @UT ProfessorsPlease replace the quizzes with some simple 8kyu/7kyu codewars problems. You can still check if people understand the material  by letting them code.
@Prospective Students
Take a different course and then come back here to do the assignments. They're actually really great for beginners and show you how to write slightly more complex programs.

Every quiz in the video expects you to know the answers without an option to supply the answer to you to help you understand why it is so if you don't happen to know the correct answer. So I was unable to answer some of the questions in the quiz and didn't understand what I was doing wrong. If the quizzes showed answers, it helps the student to know what to do next time and better understand the concept. I could skip the quiz, but what it means is, I will never really learn what I should have done in that situation. You must consider that some students are hearing these things for the first time so there is no way they will grab the idea immediately. So I found that the quizzes in between the videos, should have been helpful but were not because the correct answers were not supplied should incase the student cant figure it out.

It is very difficult to improve learning by way of the review of quizzes as they stand. It only says if it was right or wrong; you can't even see the available answers, or what input was provided. Understanding that it is undesirable to simply give the answer as the question may be recycled in subsequent attempts, if feedback were to be provided explaining why an answer was wrong, it would be far more meaningful. This would be particularly helpful with the written answers where one is left to wonder if it is a simple syntax error, or something grosser.

However, what was waaaaay more helpful was the textbook written by the teachers of this course. If you rely on this course alone to teach you anything, unless you already have an in-depth understanding of programming in another language, you will be completely lost. Honestly, I don't even understand how someone could pretend that this is a viable approach to learning programming. It's probably why I've failed at learning so many times before.A much more helpful approach is to get the textbook, PRACTICAL PROGRAMMING - AN INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER SCIENCE USING PYTHON 3, and read the chapters before watching the videos. Almost all of the weeks of the course line up perfectly with the chapters of the textbook, so you don't have to read too far ahead. The course covers chapters 1-11, although not everything is covered. One other helpful trick is to look at the course documents for the week - they often show what chapter and section they are covering, so you can read that specific part before watching the videos.I just finished the course and I am excited to finally have figured out how to get started on coding.

The challenges of learning Python, forced me to do detailed analysis and focus on solutions, taught me to be patient and persistent through testing, trial and error. This is a whole new world!

During this course, I often got interested in a part of a lecture and would experiment with things on my own. A three minute video might take me an hour to watch because I wanted to try each thing on my own, not just see it done. They would describe a problem and I would try to figure out the solution on my own before watching them do it. Sometimes I wouldn't be able to figure it out but I'd be in a better position to understand the solution when it was presented.One other aspect I enjoyed was that if I wasn't sure about a test question, I could just use the tools and try it out. Sometimes things would work in a way that was surprising to me but I found that I learned a great deal in the process of testing. It is one of the big reasons that I like formative assessment - its effectiveness as a tool to improve learning, not just to test it after the fact.As much as I enjoyed the course, it also made me think a lot about how I'll do my courses in the future. While I very much enjoy in-person teaching, I've looked at the course as a model for how I might change the way I do retests, allow use of notes, and opportunities for design projects. I know that this first year back in is going to be a busy one but my brain is working and planning.I think part of this is just that as teachers, it is important for us to try things outside of our comfort zones. If we're going to try to help kids, we have to remember what it is like to have those, ""what are they talking about"" moments? Online lectures aren't as much fun but the ability to pause and take a sidequest was super-beneficial to me. How do I make that possible for my students?I guess part of all this is that after spending half my life teaching in Blue Valley, I am far from having all the answers. I think having the vulnerability to model that you are still learning and still messing up gives students some room to do the same.The ability to learn might well be our greatest gift. Let's keep using it.",0,0,John Holloway,60200383

The lectures are clear and interesting, the quiz material tests the presented material (sometimes in challenging and subtle ways) and the three programming assignments provide a gentle introduction to developing one's own code without the headaches of having to decide in advance exactly what functions to write. Employing an autograder for student-submitted code may have necessitated this approach, but the observant student can benefit by paying attention to the insights obtained about how to conduct top-down design. The skills to be learned in this course beyond the introduction to basic Python syntax are fundamental, indeed, and will stand any beginning coder in very good stead.",0,4,Daniel Stein,4801135
