48630568~COURSE!~oCBU5_VYEeeBQA7SG0nILA,1598019529989,1,0," [Reviewing the entire specialization but points are applicable for each course]I signed up for the IBM Data Science specialization and I was genuinely excited to start it for some 4-5 weeks (I had a GCP exam coming up). I eventually started the specialization beginning of August `20 and started making my way though it and I was amazed … amazed of how much a pile of bullshit this specialization is. I made it though the first 4 courses and at the end of the SQL for data science I couldn’t take it anymore. Here’s why:1. First and foremost, the entire specialization (all 4 courses I have taken at least) were full of typos and broken URLs which a lot of other students confirm as well. This does not speak professionalism to me but whatever, lets move on.2. The in-video quizzes and following tests are simply ridiculous … you are expected to have memorized content word by word rather than understand thing for your own and be able to explain them. Some of the question were so far away from tech courses it is not even funny.3. The final assignments are a total joke. We are asked to review each other which IMHO is a terrible idea since we are all just starting up. Nothing stops you from giving top marks to a bad assignments and vice versa.4. We eventually got to the more techy part and even got code snippets and jupyter notebooks to look through but they were still bad. There was no proper order in which information was presented i.e. you would read python and seaborn code in the SQL course’s tasks even though python and matplotlib/seaborn are discussed in the following courses.5. And my final and biggest problem with this whole specialization is that it all feel like an extended advertisement of this piece-of-dodo tech inbred excuse-of-a-software called IBM cloud. There are constants up-sells here and there how almighty IBM is and how great their cloud and IBM Watson Studio are … they are not. I had to spend 2+ hours fixing problems with jupyter notebooks and their cloud just to complete my assignments which both took me 30ish minutes. They mention open source and even though there are open source equivalents to jupyter they insist using IBM cloud. I kept having the feeling they are more focused on promoting IBM products than actually bringing quality content.6. Now after finishing the SQL course there was a 1min survey which I gladly filled in basically letting them know their specialization if terrible and is doing more harm than good in my opinion. I even sent them a quick challenge because I do not think IBM maintains this course at all or even reads the reviews. You can see my challenge to IBM here: https://bit.ly/3geOyfbI was very saddened by the quality of the specialization and the content and was wondering whether I should even try and finish the remaining courses but after reading some reviews on the remaining courses I figured out it was just more of the same. If you are in the same boat I would recommend the kaggle micro-courses which I will focus on starting next week.In conclusion, I got this whole specialization for free via financial aid and I have to say even though I did not pay a dime I feel I need to be compensated by IBM and refunded real money for torturing myself with their courses.

The first 2 weeks are a giant collection of endless software lists. Rather, I would have liked to see a disciplined presentation of the data science process itself (aka Course 3 of the certificate) and then only the softwares. The only useful piece is the chart presenting the steps of the data process. The rest is purely inadequate at this stage, I am sorry. The course jumps back and forth from the very easy/trivial to the downright specific/complicated without any inbetween. Why mention Kubernetes, gateways, runtimes, PMML and other endless jargon when people don't have a clue where these fit in the bigger picture ? Instead of presenting 68 different softwares and acronyms, I believe it would be more valuable to present Jupyter Notebooks properly, from scratch and focusing on its foundational features. That would be 2-3 hours well invested. One last note: the ""Free Python 3.6"" environment (using zero machine unit) is not available anymore.

Items of the markdown lab simply don't work, as when it wants you to copy the html code to Jupyterlab the code is actually compiled into a link (hard to explain but basically means you would have to separately look into creating HTML hyperlinks). The third week is mainly about IBM's own products such as Watson Studio, but the course is obviously outdated in this aspect with items being called different names and payment verifification required to simply creat an IBM cloud account. Sadly for me, any payment method selected was declined and so the process was highly frustrating.

“Data Science Tools”, it was more or less just a list of tools for data
science. I have 5 pages of notes that are mostly useless. The only reason I
wrote so much was that the quizzes often asked about such useless details, that
I learned to write more than I usually would. Whoever designed the course/tests
obviously has no real teaching experience. In addition, do not expect any
feedback from the quizzes. There is no attempt to help the learner learn from
wrong answers.The quality of most of the “instruction” was poor. The woman
reading the script often did not logically pause when a slide was changed or
more information was added to the slide, as if she didn’t know what was on them.
For most of it, it was just a PowerPoint presentation. For IBM being so
advanced with technology, it seems for most of the teaching they simply used
20-year-old technology to demonstrate some of the most advanced technology that
currently exists. ☹ At
least they could have used a split screen to show a person AND text/screen
shots.Week 2: Better information. Same woman reading slides…who is
not convincing that she actually understood what she was actually reading.
However, the information was more useful and the tools introduced were better.
Now I’m registered on some sites and we’ll see how useful that is.Week 3: A big mix. Again lots of tools. Different people
speaking, but again they are just PowerPoint slides with no interaction with
people (unlike in the first course in the program). When there are screen captures,
sometimes they just jump and it is difficult to follow as they are quite quick.
Often the screen shots don’t have high enough resolution, so many of the tabs
in the programs are either difficult or impossible to read, or they don’t
capture the whole screen, so it’s pretty useless as we can’t really follow how
it gets from one place to another.Sometimes poor English pronunciation. Why doesn’t the person
who actually create the presentations/work with the programs actually do the
speaking?Week 4: Labs are useful and it’s great that there was some
kind of output. Unfortunately, many of the things that you have to do are not
actually taught in the course and you have to use other sources to find out how
to do things.",0,3,John Graham,78394911

Now that I have started the next course on Methodology, I feel much better and I see what it is like to have things explained in a pedagogical way! Analogies, repetition, examples...

It is very odd to me that there isn't an explanation that the first video in the lab sections is just to be watched and is not the actual lab. This is my first coursera class and I was following along with the video at first. It was also unclear when I was supposed to do what was shown in the video and when I was supposed to also complete the tasks on my own. Week 4 was a complete nightmare of mis-matched versions between the course materials and every tools and website. Considering these were all IBM tools and this is an IBM course this seems particularly problematic. It did not endear me to wanting to choose IBM products from the many similar options. I spent, without exaggerations, 4x as much time trying to navigate where the tools were now located within the tabs and figuring out what was required because things were missing in the instructions. The peer reviewed project page was particularly terrible. It needs to be QC'd asap because there is just plain missing information. I could not get a photo to embed within the Jupyter notebook no matter which method I tried. I do not know if this is because I did something wrong or if there is something I need to do specifically within Watson Studio, like add the photo as an asset, to make the photo display instead of just posting a link. In the assignments I reviewed they also only had links so I suspect it isn't possible to display an image. I lost at least 30 min to troubleshooting this. I know I could have just done another of the listed tasks, which I did, but I wanted to learn how to display a photo, and I couldn't.
