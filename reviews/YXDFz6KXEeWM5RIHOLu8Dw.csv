59267588~COURSE!~YXDFz6KXEeWM5RIHOLu8Dw,1590364287261,1,0,"The instructor has a decidedly strange view of ""rights.""  Items he cites as ""rights"" are political constructs by his particular political view.  There is no ""right"" to contraception, unless it is codified in law. IF that is the case, then it is not a right.  IF a government can grant your ""right"" it most certainly remove that ""right"" should the political winds change. I was hoping to see a more balanced view, even given the political leaning of the University of California system.  Fortunately, I paid nothing for this course and I got exactly what I paid for.",0,3,Paul Bartomioli,59267588

63655180~COURSE!~YXDFz6KXEeWM5RIHOLu8Dw,1595097395042,4,0,"Overall, the course was interesting. However, there are a number of disadvantages that affected the course assessment. Firstly, there is no forum where you can ask fellow students to check my work. This would help to complete the course faster. Secondly, it takes a very long time to check the work, for a very long time I did not have the opportunity to check the work of other students. This prevented me from getting the certificate earlier.",0,2,Пагава Теймураз Леванович,63655180

I had to work a little harder on this class as the level of difficulty was a bit higher than I have experienced with other Coursera courses that I have taken.  That being said, the challenge was enjoyed and appreciated. The actual lessons were really well explained and I came to appreciate Professor Chemerinsky's calm and reassuring voice. The content was super and I have come away from the course feeling like it was time and effort very well spent. ",0,0,Erich-Dieter Groebe,24228049

You will learn a lot about our government and what it can and cannot do.  The Supreme Court cases he explains are fascinating.  Supreme Court Justices have to be ""uber"" intelligent!

He makes strong use of audio visual aids, as well as examples from real life situations and real life  social and political scenarios. His analysis  of Supreme Court cases are a journalist's delight. Why do I write that? I write that because that are anecdotally rich and contain sound bites that are clearly easy to remember. I highly recommend this course. Well done!!
