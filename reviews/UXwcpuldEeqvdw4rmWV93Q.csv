Given the reputation of the speaker, I was expecting a higher standard. To begin with, there is far too much focus on TensorFlow. The concepts in this course are important to know, however they are briefly introduced in the videos, which are followed by a TensorFlow coding lab. The key information is hidden behind what are called ""programming assignments"", which unfortunately are nothing more than regurgitating TensorFlow code.  For week 3, the videos total 40 minutes, and for week 4, 31 minutes.  This course would be improved by spending more time explaining the MLOps principles.Many of the principles encountered in this course I have already been practising during my PhD, choosing to handcode basic pipelines to automate my ML analysis. I would say that while this course is useful, knowing how to automate a machine learning pipeline does not prepare you for the working world. Without understanding exactly what is being done when you run each TensorFlow command, you will not be able to understand what you are doing and this will limit the impact of the work produced.

The order in which topics are covered sometimes feels like it's just random. You see a subject in week one, video 4 and you see it again at the end of week 2, presented differently. It feels very weird, and if you're trying to summarise the class in a document, it's very hard. Also, there is surprisingly often no link from one slide to the next. It's just ""let's change subject and speak about this now"".
Some quiz questions (for instance in week 2) are referring to material learned AFTER the quiz itself. Also, N-th level negation questions in quizzes are just a way of having us loose our time, not a clever way of checking if some material is well understood.

The lecturer for this course is more a library creator than a user of it. And therefore also it feels like an advertisement for tensorflow. Which is an odd combination for me. So it does not teach a lot of useful theory because it focuses on how tensorflow manages pipelines and not a lot about the concepts. But also the programming examples are very artificial examples taken from the tensorflow tutorials or documentation.

What I liked in the first course was the practical view on a specific problem.

The programming exercises I also did no like because I did not learn anything useful. I only ""learned"" to use tensorflow a bit. But the concepts implemented are so basic that they are not interesting at all. I am aware that this has to be like this if we are not expected to program for two day but I don't see the benefit for me of solving mandatory useless exercises.

The result of this was: I was skipping through the videos in 2x and was solving the quizzes as fast as I could.

Speaking of quizzes. There were quizzes asking questions never mentioned in the videos and once the quiz was posed before the video where the things were explained. Also the quizzes used unusual wording for concepts plus not clearly written questions.
