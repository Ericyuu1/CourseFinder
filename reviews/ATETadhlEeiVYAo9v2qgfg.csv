327205~COURSE!~ATETadhlEeiVYAo9v2qgfg,1652498928373,4,0,"This Coursera module was able to deliver its objective - it touched on some basic economic principles i.e. why market failure is inherent in healthcare & why government intervention is required. I also liked how the lecturers were very generous with readings. However, this module fell short of 5 stars because the lecturers only focused on social healthcare systems & briefly touched on national healthcare systems. Also, in terms of user experience - I felt that my comments in the forum were left unanwered & I found it challenging to fulfill the peer-review assignment because there were no submissions for review!",0,0,Jiheon,327205
