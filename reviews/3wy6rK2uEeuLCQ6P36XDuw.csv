40253453~COURSE!~3wy6rK2uEeuLCQ6P36XDuw,1674178933373,1,0,"This course is yet another joke by Microsoft. Over 80% of it doesn't pertain to CosmosDB. It's mostly a thinly veiled dump of marketing material and basic provisioning/configuration guides for other Azure services. The presenter is deadpan and if his videos were any longer then a couple minutes each I would've given up on that. The tests and material were ill thought out, and seemingly non-reviewed prior to publishing,  given the amount of incorrect and contradictory information. I learned virtually nothing useful about CosmosDB in this entire course. The upside is it only took a couple hours to complete this ""3 week course"".",0,0,Chris Frye,40253453
