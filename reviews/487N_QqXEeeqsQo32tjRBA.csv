14078410~COURSE!~487N_QqXEeeqsQo32tjRBA,1623546304062,1,0,This course is very poorly organized to an embarrassing level. The list of required materials is incomplete. They don't tell you that you also need a soldering iron and header pins to accomplish the lab. The quizzes and homework questions are often poorly worded with no explanation for wrong answers. So you are left guessing yourself over and over if you got it wrong. Other questions are pointless in which you are asked to fill in the blank for a random thing the instructor said or is buried in the reading. It feels like the instructors couldn't be bothered to put any effort into this course. Go take the in-person version.,0,0,Jacob Anderson,14078410

I understand learning hardware from online would be tough, but at least I expected to have all lecture slides available. I think overall there were 3 or 4 lectures not available.   The only quiz I found useful was from Week 4, but you may find difficult to answer those questions if you study with lecture materials only. Also, for the circuit design, generally it isn't always obvious the annotation of components. For example, R1 and R2 in the inverted op-amp are not universally the same. They assumed you to remember the op-amp design from the lecture slides. You can still solve the problem because generally, you want to have gain.. However, in the engineering field, you never assume anything. That is an inappropriate attitude.  All other quizzes were not asking important questions. I found 40% of questions were not helpful. If you don't have an industrial background or education in electrical engineering, the quiz may mislead the importance aspect of sensor design.   I found learning PSoC was very useful. However, if you don't have a background in C programming or Arduino, you will struggle. PSoC video lectures were nice, but that would be all you have. You will get no other help what so ever. You will find Google is the best help you can get.   What frustrated me the most was, I completed the PSoC project, and it turned out to be, I didn't have to submit it. You will get no feedback on your project. Also, the answer key for the code is not available for you. The project answer keys in week 5 say that you can download PSoC project zip file to compare with your answer, but you cannot. You can download everything else but that.   I found interesting, that they listed the cost of all extra parts that you need to purchase for this course except Nscope. Nscope cost was about $100, which you can purchase from Amazon.   Summary.   The course will provide you a guideline that you can study within.   If you are interested in temperature sensor design this course may helpful.   You will learn about high-level noise handling.   Some of the lecture slides were missing.   Overall, quizzes were not thoughtfully created.   This is elementary graduate-level course. You would need an EE background.  It would be difficult if you have no experiences in C programming or Arduino.   You will not get any feedback on your design project nor proper answer.   You may spend in total $130 additional to the course charge.  The only support you can get is from Google.",0,14,Junghee Kim,25816376

One of my favorite things about the course was that I learned about the PSOC5 microcontroller, which is really a configurable system on chip. It is a very cool tool that I will likely use in the future! One complaint about the course is that the quizzes can be frustrating because some of the questions are worded strangely (to the point of being confusing), and the questions sometimes don't do a good job of testing your actual knowledge of the material and seem very arbitrary (sometimes it seems like they are trying to trick you into picking the wrong answer). Also, it took me a while to figure out that, in the multiple choice questions, the square check boxes mean that you can select more than one item, and the round check boxes mean that only one box can be selected. Recommendations for improvement would be to ensure that PDFs of the slides are provided in every lecture (the links we missing on some lectures), and to gear the quiz questions more toward material comprehension and less toward 'did this person watch the video.' All in all, I recommend this course. ",0,3,Ryan Challacombe,37530063
