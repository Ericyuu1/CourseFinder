57341898~COURSE!~qqxqtzsKEeuFQwq57XQfLw,1668052548923,2,0,"- A lot of typos in documents- Concepts and features were poorly explained; the majority of the course is documents and files being thrown on the table for learners to crawl through with hardly any further instructions, making the learning curve super steep.",0,0,Lewis Nguyen,57341898
105491422~COURSE!~qqxqtzsKEeuFQwq57XQfLw,1651730779355,2,0,"Tâ€‹he subject is interesting and exercises are educational but there are many shortcomings. Numerous assignments are broken and some answers in quizes are wrong. In the last one I have copied author's solution and even then I was 20 points short. Additionally, more than half of materials are just links to library documentation. The examples to work with are interesting, but those are almost exclusively the ones provided with sklearn library. I've learned a lot in this course, but I have a feeling that this is because numpy, pandas and sklearn are well documented, not because this course is well made.",0,2,Karol Pokomeda,105491422

44714207~COURSE!~qqxqtzsKEeuFQwq57XQfLw,1646153507756,3,0,"The course stars off well, but there is a steep learning curve and fast pace, with assignments often much harder than what was discussed in the classes or than what is reported in the documentation. Assignments could be written more clearly. However, the course does cover quite some basics on the field. ",0,2,Luca Signorile,44714207

The resources provided in the modules were helpful and mostly relevant. Besides the course not including various other models from scikit-learn, it was a fruitful experience.",0,0,Ayush Tibrewala,96845252
