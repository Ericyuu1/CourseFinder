If you ever had a recitation were the instructor repeated the important proofs from the lecture, and laid out a few examples, this is what you can expect from this course.Compare this course to lower level, equivalent level and higher level courses:  As reference I will use Khan for (much) lower level, MIT for equiv. rigor (comparing intro to intro) and a much higher level course than these (I tested something in my language, Tehcniyon if you're interested) - The conclusion is that others do a good job giving you some storytelling that connects all the subjects nicely even at much higher levels.  This course tries, but does not do it well, so it's not far from being an aggregation of subjects.  Also like a recitation.Exercises - there should be more, each DE kind is covered in only 1-3 exercises.Organization and support - forums are dead, lessons are broken at quasi-logical points.Challenge level is good - not trivial, but not too much for something you do for fun in your spare time.",0,12,Assaf Bental,30974488
