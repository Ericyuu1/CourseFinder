92159048~COURSE!~2ORasdQjEeu0JA70HcoQjw,1631868972880,4,0,"Hi, the course was good. Yet I have one note: The example with FindPlayer (Python Module lesson) loop can be confusing: The algorithm will stop after first iteration. Try to find Maradona. It will return False, but Maradona IS on the list of players. You have to modify it in order to return on successful hit or return False when no match is found at all. :) Good Luck",0,0,Jiri Macha,92159048
