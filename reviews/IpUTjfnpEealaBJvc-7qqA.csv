19244258~COURSE!~IpUTjfnpEealaBJvc-7qqA,1551928946904,1,0,"The course requires 100% perfection in order to move on from one assignment to the next in the course as well as from one course to the next within the specialization.  This expectation becomes incredibly challenging based upon 1) the minimal teaching videos, 2) lack of programming examples and practice exercises, 3) requiring students to learn and implement tools not addressed in the lessons (e.g. qsort()  and void * variables), and 4) heavily relying upon reading out-of-context selections from a textbook co-written by one of the instructors.  The structure of this course consistently poses a problem (see the discussions) when a student struggles to understand the material or cannot figure out how to fix their program, even when submitting screenshots of bugs within the course grader.  Too often, the instructors and/or their staff ignore questions and do not always provide feedback to assist the student in understanding why their code does not work (once again see the discussions).  These flaws could be overlooked if auditing these courses were an option, but at $49 per month these courses should be designed to enable students to learn foundational concepts without demanding absolute perfection.  For students who want to learn C Programming, a much better option would be cs50x and/or C Programming with Linux through edX.  Both of these courses can be audited for free and do not possess any of the issues mentioned above.",0,9,Will Oprisko,19244258

So, I used this course to refresh my memory and learn some new things.I think it is great.  HOWEVER, I honestly think that the last two assignments especially the last one was too much and too big.  I think they treated double pointers as same difficulty as assignment statements.  I think they should have gone through a BIG real-life example of how to use double pointers instead of dumping us into the poker project (like learning to swim by pushing someone into the deep end).  The other problem is that we are billed per month or we purchased X months in advance and any messages we post are not being replied to timely.  So, we have to wait days for a reply.

The teachers here are very didactic people as long as allow students to have a complete course. Thanks you all. ",0,0,Antonio Bruno Bezerra Alves,6376971

Eight years later, I have to say that C is still a challenging topic! I very much enjoying refreshing knowledge that I learned a very long time ago and had forgotten. I'm also pretty pleased with how much better I am at emacs :) I especially liked the clear introduction of how a program is actually organized in memory. Tail recursion explanation was very interesting as well. One thing that I would love to see improved is some of the testing exercises -- it is easy to get stuck and have several days of progress ruined without really learning anything new. This is small but extremely frustrating. Overall I really appreciate this course and think it was immensely helpful for me in my continuing studies. Very well organized and found the pace of the lectures excellent. Very happy and excited, thanks!",0,2,Andrew Zitek,29985740
