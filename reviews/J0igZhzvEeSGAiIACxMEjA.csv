This is an overview of who Jefferson was,  what he really thought and believed in, what his contradictions were and why they existed, and how the perception of him has changed through different historical periods.  I thought I knew a reasonable amount of information about Jefferson and the revolutionary period, but I learned so much about the historical and cultural context of the time and how it shaped Jefferson's thoughts!  Given our current judicial system's split over whether the constitution should be regarded according to the 'originalist' intention or whether it is a living document, I was surprised to find that Jefferson himself saw it as a living document, to be reshaped by each generation.  Understanding why he thought that is really essential to understanding how to think about the problem today. So this isn't just history, it's current events!I was concerned that the course seemed to be all lecture, but by the second week I was hooked.  Dr Onuf is a compelling speaker, and tries to convey who Jefferson was, the world he existed in, and get you to think about Jefferson in all his complexity.  The reading material is all pertinent, and (thank you!) not overwhelming.  This course is ""right-sized"" for an online forum.  I think you could spend about an our or maybe two per week on the lectures and reading material, and do fine.  You would do yourself a favor to view each lecture twice though, as there is a lot of material in each one.
