15210237~COURSE!~GwFPG2WhEeeHUQ7JlgRprA,1657794114705,3,0,"This one was the hardest of all in this specialization. Problem is that they gave quizes and projects which is nowhere explained, you are hit with the assignments and you have little space to be wrong. You should make some practice examples which will be similar to the projects and quizes.",0,1,Zejd Imamović,15210237

104073~COURSE!~GwFPG2WhEeeHUQ7JlgRprA,1546695399737,4,0,"Positive: Very rigorous and thorough course. Has quizzes and programming assignments which have multiple languages supported.Minus: The peer-reviewed assignments may take a long time to get graded due to small number of students. Also, the small number of students makes it almost impossible to get any help regarding the material. I have never seen the instructor replying to a student question which is not related to the courseware. The book has no solutions, so if you don't understand something, you are stuck.",0,0,Irina Reshodko,104073

The entire specialization was rock solid and develops a strong foundation for further explorations. ,0,0,Arnab Chatterjee,36678873
154759~COURSE!~GwFPG2WhEeeHUQ7JlgRprA,1550609432819,5,0,"Great course, really enjoyed! It's on the difficult side of the Coursera courses, but if you have engineering-level maths it shouldn't be a big deal. It's unnecessary to do the previous courses to do this one if you already have some practice with lie-groups robotics but it's often times not the case.I recommend not to use their library at all and code your own code so that you learn more and get more out of the course. The peer-graded assignments are the only big drawback. I think they should be automatically evaluated with a set of unit tests. Hopefully that will be sorted out at some point.",0,0,Pau,154759

Very rewarding to get through but be forewarned.",0,0,John Muth,31600823
