38422220~COURSE!~Zqm9TFXfEeuDVRIP_gaKjw,1657002047935,2,0,"The course is badly designed and is not a par with the previous 2 courses.  ① the 1st week courses was daunting and convoluted. It was meant to introduce the idea of divide and conquer which the previous courses have involved a little bit, but it spent a great deal of time introducing Fourier transform  without elaborating it clearly (actually I have to watch more relevant videos on Yotube to get it across). What's worse, the quizz and assignment are focused on the math theorem of Fourier transform instead of more concret cases of divide and conquer algorithm.② the 2nd week is about dynamic programming, which is probably the most difficuly one in the course because it's rather abstract and hard to implement & debug in programming. I do appreciate that the instructor has been persisting in blackboard writing for the whole series, but honestly I believe it would be more vivid if  those cases taught in the class could be visualized by plots/tables and it would be much more helpful if there could be at least one video leading us walk through the python codes and show us how to debug when there's error. The reason why I propose such ideas is because when I was doing the assignment, I found it very hard to conceive a proper data structure and troubleshoot the code when the answer was incorrect with no other prompt.③ the 3rd week around greedy algorithms is realtively nice and concise. By comparison, the 1st and 2nd week are truly freting.④ the 4th week's content is not vague, just looking quite irrevelant at first glimpse though. However, the assignment is quite hard to pass because is sets time limit for running the codes, but what is contradicting is that the course is about non-deterministic polynomial problems which cannot be solved effciently.  So it puzzles me a lot because there's almost no way to find a faster solution. I saw other people were raising similar problems in the forum too, but unfortunately there's no helpful advice given by teaching assistants (honestly they seldom reply).",0,1,Rafael Cheung,38422220
