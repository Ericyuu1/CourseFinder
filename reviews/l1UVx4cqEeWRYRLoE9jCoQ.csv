58815012~COURSE!~l1UVx4cqEeWRYRLoE9jCoQ,1607480670395,2,0,"Unfortunately, this course has been abandoned.  No one seems to be taking it. There are two assignments which require peer-reviews.  I submitted the first and I gave up reviewing 44 waiting submissions going back to 2016. If you submit a paper, good luck getting the reviews. I gave up immediately even though I passed all the quizzes. Good content but peer-review does not work in a class with low enrollment.",0,4,Michael G Lorenzen,58815012

Kudos to the team at UPenn for all the great visuals, and the profs do a good job in a scripted way.  If you are motivated about this topic, this is a great course to take.  One technical note: the course relies on peer graded assignments for a certificate, but no one has been doing those for at least 4 years, so it is not possible to officially finish the course as there are no peers available to grade an assignment.",0,1,Eric Mankin,5199160

I found the course very interesting and the best fit according to my need and interest. The resources are super good. It is a comprehensive course that has successfully outlined and summarized the education system along with policy from the before colonial era to the present time in the USA. The course not only provides the development of the American education system but also an overview of education policy in general which is equally knowledgable for the educators interested in global education policy. Personally, as I am focused on education policy, I found the course very very important for me. I am looking forward to further study in the same area.",0,0,Khem Raj Sedhai,22501772

The transcription of the lectures was inaccurate at times though there were only a few cases where the misinterpretation critically affected the lens of conversation. The additional resources were essential to developing intimate knowledge of the subjects at hand. My favorite reading was by Bernard Bailyn. I would be interested in taking another course with these lecturers (/UNC Chapel Hill) on education or education reform, or a related subject. Thanks for putting this together!",0,0,Christopher J.
