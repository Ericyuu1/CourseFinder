74801775~COURSE!~SjvDZfOnEeq3NhIAKTljjQ,1669300982961,4,0,I would recommend this course to someone who is familiar with python but is bellow an intermediate level.Very good content and both the professor and the project are very easy to follow along. It's a little bit short for my liking and requires some familiarity with pandas and plotly but overall you will learn a lot.,0,0,Ignacio Imola,74801775
30861027~COURSE!~SjvDZfOnEeq3NhIAKTljjQ,1600974393876,4,0,Not bad at all. Fun and great way to get into using pandas. The second to last task was too rushed and a bit of a stretch though. Slow down at that point I suggest.,0,0,Michael King,30861027

61140064~COURSE!~SjvDZfOnEeq3NhIAKTljjQ,1601450368750,5,0,"Nicely guided project with some great visualization. This project definitely shows beginners like me on the capabilities of python and its uses. This will all be much more interesting if you're a football and FIFA video game fan. Although I must say that this project requires you to be familiar with some of the modules used in the project. I wasn't too familiar with them and in the end I kinda get lost on what the instructor is doing so I just had to follow along. But still, this a great guided project.",0,0,Wan Nor Adzahari Bin Wan Tajuddin,61140064
