But the presentation fell short in many aspects. For example: 1. In the first 2 weeks of the course, I felt the instructors attempted to cover a lot of ground introducing all the parts of the Hadoop ecosystem and unfortunately none of the introduction was deep enough for me to remember. 2. Some of the lessons even attempted to talk in detail about the different variables and values needed to fine tune the Hadoop system. I am here to get an introduction to Hadoop, not fine tune it. 3. Outdated instructions getting pyspark to work for Cloudera VM. 4. Some questions in the quizzes at the end of each module were downright annoying and silly. They seemed to be testing the trivia of the Hadoop system rather than testing the big picture understanding.5. The difference between spark and mapreduce is not explained fully. I was hoping that week 5 would give a thorough rundown of what spark is, how it works and why we need it, but not much of a ground was covered.In retrospective, I feel that it would be best if the instructors redo this course properly addressing all these shortcomings.

Thirdly, you assume that your students are good with Python. This shouldn't be the case. You should have a lesson for teaching some python commands that are relevant to the course (assignments too) . OR, you can say that at the course description, that you need to study Python, and make the number of working hours 4-6 instead of 1-2 hours. Fourthly, you have Andrea Zonca's lectures; some of his lectures do not exactly mention the information needed to answer the quizzes, which also were hard to solve. Lastly, I am not sure how this course should prepare me to being a Big Data Specialist. I mostly learned some Python and Shell commands.

I have taken many other courses on Coursera, and this one is the worst.When I needed help, I visited the discussion boards, and found that there was no feedback from instructors or mentors who normally respond to posts by other students who are requesting help or information. The only feedback seems to be from a few other interested students taking the course.  There  were no discussions or answers provided  from any instructors or mentors.  Most of the posts on the discussion board were outdated, giving the impression that there is no one else is taking the course. The quizzes ask a student to ""Choose all that apply"". Most of the questions are in this format. I understand that an auto-grader usually does not give partial credit for partially correct answers, but here lies a huge disadvantage in even taking these quizzes being that a partial answer is marked incorrect, and there is no feedback provided. Instead, a student has to continuously guess until reaching the correct answer.  Many of the questions seemed to ask in a way as to ""side-rail"" the student.  Answering the course quizzes  based on the course material was apparently not enough. I found that I had to google almost every question to find out what I needed.  In turn, I found that  I learned more on the subject by reading through tech blogs on the internet, than I did by taking this course.I found that taking this course forced me to decipher through several inaudible videos whose instructors mumbled off of the bullet points in their slides. The lectures went on and on in detail and explained differences in older versions of software, yet failed to give a general overview on how the  software is utilized, and its purpose.  I was registered for the Big Data specialization, and had every intention of taking the next course, but I decided that it would be wiser to learn this material elsewhere.  It is really a shame that such an interesting subject can be portrayed in such a confusing, frustrating, and unenthusiastic manner.

specifically states, ""Previous programming experience is not required! You
will be guided through the basics of using Hadoop with MapReduce, Spark, Pig
and Hive. By following along with provided code, you will experience how one
can perform predictive modeling and leverage graph analytics to model
problems."" It also says, “Beginner Specialization. No prior
experience required.”It is impossible for me to complete the four
assignments, Word count, Joining data, Simple join in Spark and Advanced join
in Spark. I have no programming/developer background. There are no videos with
screen shots to that walk me through the steps. It's massively confusing to me.
Up until now, I've enjoyed the lessons and so far completed Intro to Big Data
(loved this course), but Cloudera’s assignments are not doable for me. The
forums aren’t useful, due to my lack of programming experience. I just don't
understand. I posted a thread on Intro to MapReduce, requesting if UC San Diego
provides expert tutoring for a fee, but noone responded.In
addition, unfortunately, Cloudera + all applications is full of never-ending
errors, so experience in debugging these issues is essential and this is on top
of just trying to learn the material as a first-timer. I'm thoroughly
disappointed, as I was really looking forward to learning in this course and
assumed because it specifically states that ""no programming experience required,""
that we would be guided with no technical issues to contend with either.

After taking the course, I feel it's not really worth the time or money (50+dollars for a course).  I have detailed complaints as follows:1, The course lists way too many simple concepts, and also very repetitive. For example the Hadoop components introduction was not only too long,  it was even repeated in the following course Big Data Analytics, and the previous course 1. The examples in the demonstration was also too simple and again repetitive. The word count case was used many times. Can you imagine a programming course teaching you to write ""Hello word!"" in 10 different ways? This is exactly it. Overall I feel the courses have not been well designed, but rather rushed through. Having multiple teachers to teach the same course was also a bad idea in my opinion, because the following lecturer seems to have not much awareness of the details that the previous lecturer did or did not talk about, this was obviously shown in several repeating(again) introduction of concepts.2, Not impressed with the lecturer's presentation skills either. They seem to mostly just talk/recite in front of a monitor and camera, reading their presentations.  I feel they just rush through the presentation in a very steady pace. They don't even do the in class examples themselves,  just show a few line of codes and a snapshot of the result. You have to figure out all the hidden pieces.  3, The assignments. They are not well thought of. Some of those questions do not present anything meaningful. It's like testing if you slept through the presentation or not, even if you did you just need to go back to the presentation file and look for the answer. 4, Not a big fan of the choice of several software. The course already introduces you to so many key components of the Hadoop ecosystem, why introduce even more that are just a small player in the system? Serious, why KNIME? Why not just focus on Spark in the machine learning course?Final thought, The course does provide a good introduction to the Hadoop ecosystem, I also find the Cloudera VM to be a very good tool for practicing and learning, saving you a lot of trouble to install the whole system on a linux system.
