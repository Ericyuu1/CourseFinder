48681~COURSE!~1ll5BIJbEeSkLyIAC1OGNA,1476995795736,1,0,"Not recommended at all. She gets some things right, but really wastes the opportunity to drill the most fundamental and important point about philanthropy: namely, that the most important factor in assessing a non-profit's value is effectiveness, and non-profits vary in their effectiveness by many orders of magnitude. Furthermore, a small number of Charity Evaluators and Meta charities have identified those charities which most effectively address the most common values of aspiring philanthropists.I don't recommend this course for anyone. Rather, I would strongly encourage anyone seriously interested Giving to check out Peter Singer's course, ""Effective Altruism"".",0,0,Tony Boyles,48681

The only reason I did not put 5 stars is that there was little community engagement. I understand that this is not the fault of the course organizers, however I felt like I was missing out because the 'real' course was over and now it is dead. I am not sure whether the instructor or TAs are usually available in MOOCs. May be using other apps, like facebook and telegram for communication would encourage more participation and dialog. I would love to take courses to supplement this one, if it is possible to receive emails or updates in the future. Thank you for an amazing semester! Best, Maulen",0,0,Maulen,8088452
