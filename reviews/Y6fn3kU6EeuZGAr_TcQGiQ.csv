84533281~COURSE!~Y6fn3kU6EeuZGAr_TcQGiQ,1645468420736,4,0,I find this course a good introduction to the software. I don't think the videos are particulary engaging. Reading lessons are just a repetition of the videos. Last assignment could be more challenging to be a strong kick off for a portfolio but it is quite concrete. I expect much more from the next courses in the specialization.,0,0,Andres Felipe Medina Ramirez,84533281
