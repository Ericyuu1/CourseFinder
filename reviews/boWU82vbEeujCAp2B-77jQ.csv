25728767~COURSE!~boWU82vbEeujCAp2B-77jQ,1644775677225,3,0,"The lack of resouces and response when you need assistance greatly detracts from some strong content. If you are not going to respond when students need assistance, you could at least provide a functional copy of the scripts reviewed in the modules after the student passes the quiz. I understand the subject matter, but I sometimes cannot get my scripts to work, no matter how meticulously copied. By that, I mean you should provide scripts you can cut and paste into your editor, not images of the scripts in a PDF forms. I poured over some scripts for hours, used all the available resouces, and I still could not locsate the minor error in a script I worked very hard on. ",0,0,Robert Pfaff,25728767

Solving the same thing using one and then the other really illustrate how the usage differs. The only improvement I'd suggest, is while the instructor does advocate best practice (e.g. use of let/const, and IIFE, he does not consistently use them, which may be confusing to new programmers)",0,1,Robert Fritz,18551860

This course focuses not only on manipulation and animation of web page elements and documents but also on timers and recursion.  In addition, there are plenty of opportunities to practice coding in JavaScript and jQuery - whether it's doing the challenge problems or following along. My only complaint is not having enough/more quizzes.  Nevertheless, I highly recommend this course. ",0,0,Jansenio Amado,49911118

15065226~COURSE!~boWU82vbEeujCAp2B-77jQ,1664402434785,5,0,"T​his course was great. I like the setup and how it works on Coursera. Bill Mead is a very good teacher. This series is great for people who don't know any JavaScript, but you do need to know a certain amount about HTML and CSS first. The first course in this series is good for giving you assignments to practice, and the first part of the second course too. With these assignments, you are asked to figure out a problem on your own, then Bill Mead shows you how he figured it out. I find doing these assignments is where I really learn and remember how to code in JavaScript. For the latter part of the second course, there weren't a whole lot of these assignments, which is my only beef about these series so far. To give Bill Mead and Coursera credit, I haven't come across any other online JavaScript courses that do better when it comes to giving assignments. I've tried Codecademy and Free Code Camp too, and I like Bill Mead's style of teaching better than Codecademy and Free Code Camp approaches. I tried a few books also, like Eloquent JavaScript, which went above my head some of the time. ",0,0,Duncan Hedley,15065226

But I will say I found it demotivating when the instructor talked so much about jQuery's weaknesses and the fact that it's going out of fashion and that CSS is better to use for animation than the jQuery library, and then seemed to spend more time on jQuery solutions than plain JavaScript. I was considering completing the JS specialization, but it looks like the next course is also heavy on jQuery, and it sounds like my time would be better spent studying plain JS.",0,1,Nikolai Humphrey-Blanco,23550092
