81630649~COURSE!~mXKnDcCFEea-SBIUQUfMxA,1625167419403,1,0,"This course is disappointing. There are so many issues that I found hard to believe UIUC selected it as part of MBA program course.1. It addresses important topics related to poverty and sustainability that I agree  we and business should care about but the focus is blur. There is no connection with business globalization whatsoever. No content related how business should be conducted at global environment. Course name is misleading. We worked on project for a country and only focus on that country2. Content in article, video and live session are repetitive, literally from week 1 to week 8. 3.  Outdated and inaccurate information.  4. Boring content and presentation. Instructor obviously reads to speak. 5. Live session is disorganized. Instructor failed to clarify questions. He only focused on how to complete projects instead of teaching what we should learn.6. Poor language choice. Hard to follow content in video and article compared to other courses I've taken. Purposely use sophisticated verbiage for simple concept.  Should consider students that do not speak native English. Education is to make complicated theory easy for student to understand and apply to real world problem. Not to complicate simple concepts.",0,2,Dorathy Anderson,81630649

What is really annoying about this course is that your peer-reviewed submissions never have enough people to actually review your material. This means that, even if you are quick, you cannot finish the course. This entails that you have to pay at least twice and the only help provided is the suggestion to post a request to review your submission in the community forum. But this forum is empty and noone replies to your requests.Moreover, this course does not have a support. Noone to talk to if you have problems or questions as the forum is completely empty and no contact details of anyone provided anywhere.",0,4,Tim Bartmann,41613665
