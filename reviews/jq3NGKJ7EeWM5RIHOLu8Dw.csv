3704790~COURSE!~jq3NGKJ7EeWM5RIHOLu8Dw,1590733356667,2,0,"The intent of the capstone it great; it gives ample chance to reflect on the courses that one has gotten before - very important for learning.There are a number of bad parts as well.The instructor, though presenting only a few minutes, seems like a beginner in producing online courses; difficulties reading well from the prompter.The project material is quite vague. Many pages of text. I would much rather see an illustrated, charted, even enacted version of the information. E.g. if I'm reading about a conversation it would be better to see 2 people having it.The course is offered too seldom!Lastly, but probably the most important, the substance of this capstone is quite thinned out by the evaluation method (peer reviews); the work that the colleagues put in is very variable. Non the less, the grades are all generously distributed.",0,2,Emil Ferent,3704790
3826621~COURSE!~jq3NGKJ7EeWM5RIHOLu8Dw,1636561574586,3,0,"I definitely recommend taking this class to complete the certificate sequence. The issue is that there really isn't much content in it. The assignments do connect back to some of the course concepts, but not really in an integrated fashion. Some of the description in the video as far as what students need to do isn't accurate in comparison to the assignment instructions. ",0,0,Steven Meyers,3826621
3654884~COURSE!~jq3NGKJ7EeWM5RIHOLu8Dw,1493275781634,3,0,"Great case study, but the way to engage the audience might have been way better. Assignments were individual and it was very difficult to use them at full power, because they were quite boring. Interaction with other learners would be very beneficial in a form of group assignment. Videos are very boring and useless in comparison to incredible content in the first 6 courses of the specialization. Capstone should have been done by the same (high) standards as other courses in specialization.",0,6,Anton Fedoseev,3654884
