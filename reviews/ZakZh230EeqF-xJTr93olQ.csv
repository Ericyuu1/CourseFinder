45888613~COURSE!~ZakZh230EeqF-xJTr93olQ,1628400688115,1,0,"There are never enough peer review opportunities available when I have completed my assignment and am ready to review others' assignments. As a result, I have to wait multiple days, sometimes even a full week in order to completed a course within this program.

Update...several days later, and still no peer review available. This program is dysfunctional and I would never recommend it to anyone. I would like a refund asap!

90239268~COURSE!~ZakZh230EeqF-xJTr93olQ,1659080317266,4,0,"As an experienced sourcing & procurement professional (who wanted to brush up skills) I can confirm that the training is based on solid professional experience, down-to-the-earth, concentrating on the essentials and avoiding too many theoretical acronyms. Fancy, interactive slides would be a further plus, but not really required and one maintains the focus where it needs to be. If I provide 4 out of 5 stars, the reason is that I experience challenges with the assessments and tests: Uploading PPT as indicated results impossible, but it works with uploading an image of those (however, less readable). Also, it should be indicated how to answer a question. e.g. if multiple choice and you type in the test instead of a, b etc, this is rated as an error despite having the right answer. And if you type in b. instead b (nowhere indicated), it also reads as an error. Resolving this could improve the experience a lot! Thanks overall to the great trainer!",0,0,Birgit Hartmann,90239268
