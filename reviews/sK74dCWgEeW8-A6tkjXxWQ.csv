The course is more or less mistaking ""Leadership"" with basic managerial skills required from C-level industry leaders. It has nothing to do with advanced Leadership concepts taught in business schools around the globe. Mistaking one for the other is one of the fallacies of unsuccessful CEOs. Many of the behaviours and actions shown in the videos would not have been compatible with the advanced industry leadership roles I held in the past. I am a CEO. On a more practical note, I was a bit annoyed that some of the mandatory reading materials required a subscription to The Wall Street Journal.

Another interesting way of presentation is that it is not recorded like a normal film. It is free of any special effects or production design. Though it is tried to disguise this as often as possible, one can see that the actors are reading from scripts. Professor explains that, It's common practice in the theater when someone want to develop new scripts and have limited time to do so, to produce what is called staged readings, where actors read from the script. It allow to concentrate on storytelling through dialogue between people without the fuss of a lot of visual production elements.",0,0,Rajiv Sinha,88811945

We normally just write our opinion, independently of other students contribution which is not what we should do. Maybe some videoconference appointments could facilitate some real debates and more learning.Also, when possible, more time to prepare a good final work would be appreciated since to summarize so much content it's not easy and it requires time.In any case, as I said, highly recommended course, and methodology.
