108206226~COURSE!~N03pm_bSEeuEcw6azz3PZQ,1659764894215,2,0,"Very well thought out course with very substandard maintenance.  The instructors are great, the maintenance is not good.  Exercises didn't quite work for me (well designed, bad support and execution), and nobody answered my questions in the forums, which were very simple.  I'd expect more out of paying for this",0,0,David Sheu,108206226

This course is a great intro to the subject matter.  It is very succinct, covers quite a bit of ground and can be completed in a day or two. The videos, labs and quizzes very straightforward. Great experience and much better way to get started with this information than wading through AWS documentation! ",0,1,Richard Schaefer,38195716
