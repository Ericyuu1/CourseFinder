Perhaps he is so biased that he doesn't even see the problem. I'm alienated. It's a pity because this should be a course that teaches one to be objective, something that the instructor clearly isn't. How he clinged to the chair of a department of an Ivy League university is an example of how our universities have long ago abandoned the pursuit of truth.",0,1,Anderson M. Winkler,3243696

It starts slowly and uselessly by explaining the marvels of science, and concludes on a hymn to science, that turns partisan: the very flaw that this course aims at pointing at. The cause I like is not developed, expanded, explained, but sold, in a way that touches more on one-way debating than philosophy of science. ",0,6,Fred Vacelet,52392326

To carry this a bit further, the legal system has elements of the scientific inquiry (e.g., ""peer review"" via jury, rules of evidence, cross examination) yet it isn't, and perhaps shouldn't be ""scientific.

materials as souvenirs and references for teaching. The best thing I learned and

discuss objectivity or empiricism or ethics. They were much relevant that
helped me understand the concept well. Secondly, the course introduced me to
contemporary philosophers (of science) besides some iconic figures of the past.
