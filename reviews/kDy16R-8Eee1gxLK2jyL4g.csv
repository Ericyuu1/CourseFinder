10482997~COURSE!~kDy16R-8Eee1gxLK2jyL4g,1671657150590,1,0," this course does not show installation on Mac or Linux, it still provides a valuable overview of the basics that can help someone understand how Selenium works. This knowledge will enable someone to more easily install and configure the software for their own environment as well as create automated tests with greater efficiency.",0,0,Bekzod Ahmedov,10482997

91494939~COURSE!~kDy16R-8Eee1gxLK2jyL4g,1669966559518,4,0,"Good course in term of conceptual learning, especially for making learners aware of various aspects of testing web & mobile application. In term of practical learning, this course is quite lacking in the feedback to learners. Learners have to figure out the problem and solution by themselves without proper guidance. Would be better also if there is sample back-end web testing (e.g. REST API)  in addition to front-end Automation using Selenium/Appium. For the Appium & JMeter assignments, it would be better to include diagram of the test system. Learners could benefit from understanding the interconnection between test system components and easier to setup the test environment",0,1,Budi Sanjaya,91494939
