43893550~COURSE!~HxoiMRisEeu94xKESQ3enQ,1609035448228,5,0,Abby Saey's courses are some of the Best Project Courses I have done in Coursera. Her explanations are easy to follow and she points out all important details and tips. This course teaches us how to create a course in Eduflow and how to include and facilitate online discussions to our course. I highly recommend this course and other courses by Abby Saey. All the Best!!!,0,0,Bensen Alex,43893550
