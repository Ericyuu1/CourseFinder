This may have more to do with my age than anything else. I grew up in the '50s and '60s.  Again, I want to say that I would have learned more if we had been tested once a week, rather than every two weeks. Since the quizzes are so heavily peppered with song titles and dates, two weeks' worth of material is just too much to remember. Another criticism is the text that comes with the videos.  I like to read them while watching the videos, to kind of cement my learning. However, this course had really bad text with the videos!  Many words were translated from voice, incorrectly.

Furthermore, the course explores the music prejudices and racism that certain white music fans and white Rock n' Roll musicians have displayed toward Black artists and Black Pop. So this course offers a fascinating study on the racial divisions that exist in the music culture and in our society.

Professor Covach has not only very entertaining way of talking about the music but the genuine love and engagement is so visible, that you can't not to smile when watching his lectures. Not to mention the knowledge, oh boy, that's a huge piece of history with the mind-blowing diversity we're talking about. Which also makes it impressive how much of the information is included in the course. And it made me hungry for more! Anyway, I loved both parts of the course, it was pure joy and I managed to learn a lot about music history from the early XXth century, which I'm sure I wouldn't pursue on my own.
