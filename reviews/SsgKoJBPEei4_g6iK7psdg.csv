But the setup and material was not the only problem. One of the main goals of the course was to show and get used to common problems you encounter when working with a new dataset. To reach this goal, an arbitrary dataset has been introduced and investigated in depth. Fair enough, but I do not think, that it is necessairy to do such an in depth investigation just to raise awareness that datasets might be messy and the use and distribution of such data must be done carefully.

The topics mentioned that we should know or go back to the first course were not even in the first course, and if I'm going to be constantly going to videos online on free sites, then what was the point in paying for this course? It also became painfully clear that it's expected that we have some deep understanding of the data and business, and since we (the students) did not create this data and don't have any real maps of how things are connected or what they acutally represent, it makes this course that much more aggrevating.

Possibly there was AB testing in an assignment, but it was never once made clear that is what we were doing.There is absolutely no actual instruction going on in this class. It's very frustrating and is structured as following:  a ""lecture"" (the instructor talking about something kinda of related to what you might be doing), an assignment that is more along the lines of ""figure it out,"" an ""optional"" discussion (that isn't actually optional as it unlocks the solution), and a ""solutions"" video where the instructor walks you through her thought process of the assignment that you just had to figure out.

A lot of times, it was like the instructor was taking a normal day on a data science job and walking you through it.The issue is the lack of structure to the course. Because it was like a a day on a job, there weren't explicit learning goals. Things like ""Today we're going to learn how to clean messy data"" isn't a learning goal. Instead, you want something like ""Here are some ways in which data are messy. I'll walk you through what I do with each one."" The assignments reflect this. I can't stress enough how poorly the assignments supported my learning. The assignments were usually very vague, with instructions that I had to parse through to understand what was even required of me. Questions that just asked open-ended ""Does this look right?"" kind of questions? I mean... looks fine to me, but I'm literally in a beginner SQL course so what do I know? Then we watch a solutions video where the instructor writes the code to answer it. It lacks any kind of student engagement and doesn't facilitate learning at all.It's really indicative of the lack of structure of the course. Since there aren't learning goals, there isn't any framework from which to design assignments. The information lacks context, so it doesn't seem useful until the very final assignment, when you need to have learned the A/B testing stuff (but not really anything else). The course material doesn't build together in a logical fashion. I feel like you could take the 4 modules in any order and you'd get the same out of it. This suggests that there isn't a core skill that's being developed over time, but rather a mishmash of ideas that might be useful in a data science position. In all, I can't recommend this course.

It did not ever even explicitly state which SQL language was being used (note it is different from the language used in the first course in the series).

This is my view and experience and not sure about others. I felt she must have a great knowledge about Ab testing and SQL but unable to pass the same to her students. I faced difficulty in understanding her situation, examples and more importantly how she write queries. There is no explanation on how and where the query comes from. She states clearly that if you don't understand please review the previous course or lessons. There are many stuffs in Course 2 which were not taught or shown in Course 1 to refer from. All above, using Mode analytics was not that user-friendly specially while submitting the final assignment. There are not clear indication or guidance how to use where to go etc. If we need to do self learning we could have gone directly to mode and grasp the knowledge. Her solution videos with typing noise was irritating. Overall, the course has so much to learn and understand the data but for me it wasn't that easy with such tutor especially with fresher like me in IT field or SQL knowledge. Sadie on other hand for Course 1 was way better in explaining and easy to understand.  All the best to other guys enrolling this course.

The coursera search engine is pretty inefficient.

More time should have been taken explaining the coding concepts, rather than watching mistakes. Also, there wasn't much discussion. I had trouble with some of the early assignments and (as instructed) asked for help in the discussion. But no one EVER responded! So I stopped asking for help. Basically, everyone just wrote ""done"" or something like that. To be fair, I'm not sure anyone actually looked at or read the discussion threads.
