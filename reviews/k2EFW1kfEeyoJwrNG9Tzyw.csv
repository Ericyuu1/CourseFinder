27850647~COURSE!~k2EFW1kfEeyoJwrNG9Tzyw,1676912718193,5,0,"Good balance of theory and practical labs, concepts were well explained with a good level of detail. The course has improved how I code and made my development more test-driven. I would recommend this course if you want to write more robust and higher quality code. The course seemed geared towards e-commerce/ commercial apps. I think an improvement would be to show how to write tests in additional domains i.e working with data other than account data. For example I would have liked to know how to mock/patch more complex classes. ",0,0,Robert Morse,27850647
