39294085~COURSE!~MxCQMv9QEei9jhJCCemBhA,1662716699478,5,0,"C​ourse was quite fast paced and tough to follow up for few concepts. Excel demostrations were quite good, exercises were really helpful to really grasp the topics taught. Syllabus was also well constructed.  Tougher topics can be explained with more examples or with length to really get the concepts.

Overall a good experience for learning. Thank you.",0,0,Meet Kakadiya,39294085
