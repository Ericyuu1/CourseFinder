28134803~COURSE!~PqZ1_20nEeqE7xK8d4jUFw,1586334803120,1,0,"By far the worst Coursera course I've ever done. The interface is barely useable (two windows in one tab), you have to sign up to various accounts including with a credit card for AWS, and the session times out in just over an hour for the two hour course. I want a refund! Avoid.",0,1,Andy Harper,28134803

1188943~COURSE!~PqZ1_20nEeqE7xK8d4jUFw,1608486385660,3,0,I was glad to find that Tensorflow and Sagemaker were available on Coursera.  When working through this project I ran into a couple of snags that weren't addressed in the content and had to go digging in the discussion forums.  The first was the Resources limits on AWS regarding the instance type which I needed AWS support to engage on.  This created some lag time to finishing the material.  The way the course is designed now it assumes that you work through it in one session.  Coming back to it creates some issues (such as the model needed to be retrained to be served).  This serving portion also didn't work for me out of the box and I'm still trying to find a suitable solution on Inference Endpoints in SageMaker from saved model artifacts on S3.,0,0,Brad Arndt,1188943

I have been struggling to get a proper tutorial or documentation online to properly prepare the training script, so this course really saved my day.I would add some more advanced features such as: import your own dependencies with ""requirements.txt"" and train with multiple instances.",0,0,Silvia Gonella,41004387

In my opinion, since the course is marked as difficult the students should be capable of solving some problems on their own. I would still encourage people to learn about this tool since it can be used to take models into production with a simple API.",0,2,Sebastian Rivera Gonzalez,37588721
