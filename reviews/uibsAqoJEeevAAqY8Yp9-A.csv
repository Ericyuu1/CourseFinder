The videos are nice, but I expected a lot more hands-on and practical lessons. However, this isn't what makes this whole experience bad. The peer review system is completely broken and discouraging. Every single time my submissions were reviewed very unfairly by some anonymous individuals who left incoherent feedback (literally ""asodjlldkf"" or ""ok""), and I had to re-sumbit many times to receive fair assessment. When reviewing others' submissions, I encountered dozens of incredibly lazy works with broken English (again, can't judge something that's incomprehensible). This took away all of my motivation since I spent hours on my project and was looking forward to full and comprehensive feedback from other learners (especially considering that the assignments were quite interesting and strict).

I will spend hours of time completing a project to make sure I meet all requirements of an assignment, only to receive a horrible score and have it torn to shreds by ""fellow"" classmates. You are given the opportunity to resubmit your assignment for a better grade, but just be aware that some classmates are not taking the course seriously, nor are they upholding the supportive spirit of the course. Then there are more experienced or overly opinionated peers that will leave quite nasty remarks knowing this is a ""beginners"" class. Art is subjective, but a lot of students will take off points because something is not their taste. Most of your peers are supportive in this course, but the bad apples can make for a very sour experience.Overall, I give high marks for the instructor, though it is VERY theory driven, not even technique driven instruction.

I really enjoyed it! My only concern as a somewhat experienced designer looking to add the skillset of UI/UX is being graded by students with no experience at all who might get too hung up on a technicality (e.g. having 12-13 balance images in the moodboard rather than 15-20 and getting docked points because I didn't make the technical threshold).,0,0,Kathleen Corgan,68114667
68937327~COURSE!~uibsAqoJEeevAAqY8Yp9-A,1604025282980,4,0,"I think the course itself has very good content, but a lot of the information given in class, outside of readings, is more theory-based rather than teaching actual rules and set guidelines. Yes, there is freedom in design but knowing and understanding rules and how to use them (ex. when and how to use color or rules about font sizes and how many should be used) would be very useful.   Also, this is nothing against the class, but some individuals do not give fair reviews, let alone useful feedback for the purposes of improvement.  A requirement of a certain amount of characters should be presented when entering a written review of someone's work.  ""Good"" or ""-"" is not a reasonable response.

It would be nice to have more examples of simple/complex designs, with explanations ( as a pdf, reading material) so people get an even better idea, especially as we are speaking of beginners who really don't have a sense of how the good design should look like, a combination of colors and so on... Honestly, I didn't find reviewing someone's project comfortable, because, we all have different ""feeling"" for design, and therefore it wouldn't be fair not to give someone a point because I simply don't like their design (example, of two people who reviewed my work, one really liked it, and another one didn't like some elements). It would be better to have a discussion, where we can share our ideas/work and discuss it. Minus: Some reviewers are not honest, meaning they can take away some points for elements that are actually there, or they can give you 0 points without an explanation. In my opinion, the feedback should be imperative, and the grading system should be improved as well.

Since from the very beginning of the course you are free to choose the application idea from one of the given options, but then in the end of each week your submitted assignment has to meet some particular strict requirements (such as some fixed amounts of visual elements, buttons, etc.), maybe it makes sense to restrict options you can choose of, or to mention all the strict requirements from the very beginning of the course, because sometimes it felt like I had to intentionally complicate my application (e.g. add more visual elements that do not make much sense, but in order just to meet the required criteria set in the assignments).All in all, thanks for a great course!",0,6,Myroslav Oleinykov,15816855
