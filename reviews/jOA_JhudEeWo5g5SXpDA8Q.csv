The assignments were well-thought out (glad there aren't any quizzes), but the peer-review-grading was a little frustrating.

But after you've found them, I think, you'll find that they are wonderful and by reading them and listening to the professor's lectures, you get a tremendous exposure to Chinese culture.  I wondered how four texts could do this, but they are so well picked, that they do.  Except for the difficulty getting the texts, this has been one of the most satisfying courses I've taken.  I highly recommend it, but I also recommend that the mentors find the texts and make them easily available to students.",0,3,Michael New,1980493
