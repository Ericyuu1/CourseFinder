The whole ""course"" is not different from many blog posts you can read for free in 10 minutes.

I'm pretty disappointed in Coursera.",0,0,Matteo Marchelli,7126815

It's basically a set of instructions which doesn't require thinkig at all because the instructor does everything for you. In that case at least I would expect that some theory would be pass on in these videos but not, it's basically reading the prepared README files. The author also struggles with command line which makes these video much long than they should be taking into account that they don't include any valuable knowledge. If you want to learn more about how k8s, prometheus and grafana are integrated you have to look for it yourself.",0,0,Hubert Skowronek,5454509
