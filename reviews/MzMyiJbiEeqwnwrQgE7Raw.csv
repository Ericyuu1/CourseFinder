Unless I didn't know where to look, I don't feel like I received any feedback from the instructor on discussion postings, etc.  I think this is an important part of any class and should be portrayed to students in this class if we are trying to get the students to understand the importance of interaction and feedback in an online class.",0,1,Annette Hoelzer,66193313

4793174~COURSE!~MzMyiJbiEeqwnwrQgE7Raw,1595408564938,5,0,"This course is wonderful because it came at a time of high uncertainty and change being experienced in higher education. This course takes you to step by step understanding of the current changes in the environment, and how to rethink about delivering a course such that it withstands any given circumstances. It takes you through the process gradually and the presentation is wonderful with really good resources. ",0,0,Samreen Khan,4793174

Dr. Quintana puts the idea of resilience as the overarching feature of all courses. ""Resilience"" serves also as a mantra for focus on how to make courses purposeful, accessible, and ready for any and all unexpected changes in context and circumstances. Quintana offers three principles, extensibility, flexibility, and redundancy as meta characteristics for the development of college level courses that include online asynchronous components or stand as completely asynchronous. I found this course fascinating, inspiring, and enormously enriching.",0,0,Suzanne,6286799
