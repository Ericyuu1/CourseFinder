70395596~COURSE!~WGTE5ZulEeuvAhKafbQOPQ,1629082935112,3,0,"T​he content is helpful and inspiring for those who are interested in Flight Mechanics. However, there are some typo in the quiz (and sometimes they affect the meaning of the problems, for example, the incorrect parameter the speed at the top of the loop ""n_C"" in the final exam, which should have been ""V_C"" according to the problem setting). I can see the instructor is trying to use different ways for students to interact with the problems, but it seems that some questions like ""choose all the words describing the attitude of the airplane"" in the assessment for week 2 is too ambiguous and could not be answered correctly. For the last exam, I have to go back to check the discussion forum to see how others program the answer so that the answer can be accepted by the system before I can pass the exam, even though my derivation for the answer is correct (for example, in the problem, some of the parameters have suffix, so I type, for example, ""V_A"", and the preview shows the correct suffix, but the form accepted is ""VA"", which is not suffixed). Generally speaking, if you are not that care about the score and want a definite 100% score, you will have a great time learning this course.",0,2,Yu-Cheng Chen,70395596

Additionally, it is helpful to already be familiar with aeronautical knowledge such as theory of flight and the basic anatomy of airplanes, although some of it is reviewed at the start of the course. I liked learning about the HUD (heads up display) and the more practical aspects of flight mechanics that are useful to pilots and other related aviation personalities.I did not like the fact that a lot of the course felt like there was more opportunity to expand or explain different topics.
