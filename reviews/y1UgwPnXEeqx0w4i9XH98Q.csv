13588033~COURSE!~y1UgwPnXEeqx0w4i9XH98Q,1609927629951,3,0,"This course is for people with some experience in precalculus.The author doesn't spend much time explaining everything in detail but will give a quick around view of the major aspects of the subject. Recommended for people who want to brush up their basics.Again the course (specialization) consists of a number of other courses which is themed for data modeling, so this first two course focuses on brushing up our linear algebra and trig. Once we get familiarize with the tool for modeling, then I assume the final two-course focuses on the modeling.As of now, I haven't taken the rest of the specialization, but with a little effort from the course and with the help of any textbook. This course will be helpful to anyone who wants to learn more about Precalc and modeling.Again precalc is a little extensive, so I can fully understand, with the 4 weeks lecture one can cover only the major areas of it. As said earlier with some help from textbooks and these videos, it will a good learning experience. Looking forward to doing the next course from the specialization.",0,4,Deleted Account,13588033
106759622~COURSE!~y1UgwPnXEeqx0w4i9XH98Q,1672203500704,4,0,"The course is good.  It is a continuation of the algebra courses that were awesome.  The lectures are clearer than any math teacher I ever had in school.  A few of the exercises are a bit frustrating in this course, though.  In the algebra courses, we were given feedback on incorrect answers.  In this course, all of that feedback is missing.  When you get an answer wrong on a quiz, you don't see a solution worked out to help you figure out why you got it wrong.  A lot of the questions involve entering the answer as a rounded decimal.   When I get those wrong on occasion, I would love to know if I got the answer incorrect because I screwed up the math or because of an issue with a silly rounding mistake.  If there were adequate feedback, I'd give this course 5 stars without hesitation.  ",0,0,Richard Creek,106759622

I am in the latter category, some of these I learned several years ago and I even filled in some of the holes in my understanding and even cleared up some of my misconceptions. The lectures are very well organized and the explanations are clear. I would definitely go through these lectures at a slow pace unless you already know all this material. Also take time out to do all the quizzes and sample problems; they are all very helpful in grounding the material.

The teacher is particularly patient and thoughtful. He guided me step by step, no rush, not skipping things, so everything is understandable. Although for a non-English speaker like me he speaks rather fast, the good news is that when it comes to some confusing points, he'll lower the speed. Each lesson builds on the previous ones, and one lesson may shed light on the next one. For example, the lesson of inverse function is a good pre-lesson for lessons concerning e^x/ln(x), while omitted by many teachers. Last but not least, it is really good that the quizzes of the course give many questions that require students to use the knowledge they learned in this course earlier. As everything is practiced over and over again, we won't easily forget the knowledge we learned yesterday.Thank you Mr. Cutrone!
