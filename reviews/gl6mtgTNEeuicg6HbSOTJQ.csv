86931062~COURSE!~gl6mtgTNEeuicg6HbSOTJQ,1623787819289,4,0,"T​he course is good -- it is the second in a three part series and takes a nice look at both mitigations and adaptations that we can take to address climate change. The only problem with the course is the final assignment; we are asked to create an infographic, which isn't a bad assignment in general, but there is no way to submit a file as your assignement submission -- the field only allows for text -- nor are there any instructions for ways to do file sharing. Coursera should really fix this; otherwise the course content is good. ",0,0,Sage Briscoe,86931062

The quizzes  and the final peer-reviewed assignment are sensible. Some video transcripts might be reworked as they contain a bunch of typos.,0,0,Heinz DÜRR,43139926
