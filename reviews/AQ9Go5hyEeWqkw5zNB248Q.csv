71315923~COURSE!~AQ9Go5hyEeWqkw5zNB248Q,1603182053140,1,0,Avoid this course. The title looks promising but the course fails at many levels.The lectures are quite good but not what the title suggests. It is more like a quick review of basic Spring features (in random order). The end result is that this is neither a beginner nor an intermediate-level course(and certainly not advanced). The quizzes are too easy and some of them bugged. Not really useful in anything other than slowing you down.The assignments are really problematic. Outdated and not offering any flexibility to apply what the course tries to teach. It is more 'hack your way' through the grading system than implement a service/application. You can actually get a perfect score without implementing a lot of stuff. The end result is a huge waste of time.

The assignments are also very relevant and are a nice opportunity to get the hands dirty.But (and this is a huge but which I am sure will be in a lot of other reviews) the maintenance of the programming assignments could be a lot better. The assignments use older versions of different tools such as spring and gradle. As a result, certain things such as running the files and creating a submission become very difficult as they seem to use features which are now deprecated. The process of sorting through all this, though unintended, still had me learning a lot. It however made me take a loooot more time than I should have with the assignments. I easily spent 50% of my time fighting with the tools and the other 50% doing the assignments.
