This course has concrete examples, and the lecturer doesn't treat his audience like the first-grade kids."" I take this back. The lecturer doesn't know what he's taking about and what he is gonna talk about for at least half of the time. ",0,0,Gu Feng,24380398
28783891~COURSE!~u41Z-k3PEeWjfw5p9aPb_w,1663349383664,2,0,"I​nadequate homework assignments to support learning, so you'll have to spend a lot of time beyond the course's weekly time estimate. You might as well just watch lectures on YouTube and read Wikipedia, that's what I end up doing anyway.",0,0,Steven Hartman,28783891
1091805~COURSE!~u41Z-k3PEeWjfw5p9aPb_w,1624125500993,2,0,"The instructor does a poor job of conveying information and seems to spend most of his time demonstrating that he understands the subject well. He would do better to focus on core concepts instead of talking through tangent details and implications of them. He expects the learner to visualize everything he is saying, which is mostly impossible without any prior understanding of the subject (which ... the learner does not have or they would not be taking this course.)",0,0,Alexander Katsenelenbogen,1091805

5393878~COURSE!~u41Z-k3PEeWjfw5p9aPb_w,1619869862673,3,0,"Quite a different course as compared to Mathematical Biostatistics Boot Camp 1. Many different tests for contigency tables are presented, however, without the proper mathematical derivation. It is just: Here is another test for this - more like a cookbook. Videos and quizzes are sometimes incoherent as if being put together from different sources without much care. ",0,0,Sven Schuierer,5393878

6584280~COURSE!~u41Z-k3PEeWjfw5p9aPb_w,1474794800917,3,0,It was very challenging. It would be better if a couple of practice exercises were put after the relevant lecture videos and not just after the weekly lecture videos. ,0,0,Edit Takacs,6584280

11721030~COURSE!~u41Z-k3PEeWjfw5p9aPb_w,1475333738583,4,0,"Thankful that a course like this exists, as most MOOCs are quite basic.  And thanks to Coursera for running the courses even though attendance seems to be low (darn, that pesky calculus pre-requisite).  Lecture quality is varied--some quite good (such as the lectures in Boot Camp I) and others seem like he hadn't looked at his notes for a long time.  It's great to hear a stats professor talk about the strengths and weaknesses of many approaches.  It complements a mathematical statistics book quite well.  It would have been nice to have had some problems that were more challenging.  Overall, while the Johns Hopkins Data Science MOOCs are pretty good, they are a bit more basic than what's available through MIT and Stanford.",0,3,Michael Kesling,11721030
