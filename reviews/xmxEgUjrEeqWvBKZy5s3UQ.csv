I do appreciate that material is being developed in real time and thus the course is attempting to respond to latest developments, but as a learner you can't really plan your work if you are being referred back to previous modules. The online technology is also not very good. Module 5 for example on community participation, is resetting all the videos that I have watched (and taken notes on ) as to be watched, yet again! It is also impossible to access the assignment and the link refers you back to the original course details, which is not at all helpful. The online note claims the submission deadline has expired and it is not possible to resubmit (I haven't even submitted it once let alone resubmit). I am getting increasingly frustrated (not by the content, but by the technology platform running this course). And I have found it virtually impossible to contact those people managing and overseeing the course to make these points (there are only online forums where similar views are being expressed). If you are intending to run a course entirely online (and other organisations manage this successfully) then you need to get the basics right and make sure the technology will enable and not frustrate learning.

Since this course offers no certificate, it'll remain in your ""in progress"" section until you either unenroll or ask Coursera to manually move it to the ""completed"" section, which might take multiple mails and persistence. That's something Coursera could improve upon. Some parts of this course have embedded windows. They look like three windows within each other, having a tiny font and my browser is unable to zoom in. Sometimes, they just display a grey box. It would be great, if the course creators could use technologies, which are more accessible, so everybody taking this course can do every part.Unfortunately, like with many Coursera courses it is really cumbersome to download parts of the course: some pages aren't printed completely and there's no option to download the whole course.
