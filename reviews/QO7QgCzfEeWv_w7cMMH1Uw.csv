15314726~COURSE!~QO7QgCzfEeWv_w7cMMH1Uw,1460220584983,2,0,Headed downhill. Lessons are starting to feel like not enough time was put into preperation... or like this course was assigned as a project to some students so the professor could make a dollar (like textbooks). One of the instructors even said at one point they didn't have enough time. What does that even mean in an online course. You could be fixing it right now and improving the course. This whole thing is being handled like a college course and that is crazy. On-line courses can undergo continual improvement. The college course paradigm is dying because we can do it better now.
