Technically - videos are in nice chunk-lengths, (short and focussed)  but the sound is a bit faulty: some hiss, and low volume-level , - which is more obvious as the lecturer is softly spoken.

I kept on wanting to tell  him to sit up and breath and speak naturally! On top of that, the sound quality was simply awful! If the Prof were to take some acting or presenting lessons and improvements to the sound quality were made (or a professional actor hired to present the material) it could be one of the best courses ever, but instead, it was hard to get through for me even though the material fascinates me as I'm learning neuroscience and love movies.

Like pointing the correct fact or wrong facts of the ""use of memory""  by the movies. The class has a lot of knowledge very well synthetized and very easy to organize in the program (not making to many efforts to of remembering the first class concept). But the most important fact of the class is that the knowledge was applicated until we could do it by ourselves. I always wanted to do investigation or research (phycology with neurosciences) but never could find a explicit motive or objective in my career (couldn´t make a portrait of myself as a professional in the future). But Maybe I could try some research for memory topics like ""finding out the cause of Alzheimer's "", etc. Please don´t get angry I haven´t read your book yet... I am a lazy student and also a very ¿cheapskate person ?  (plus no credit card and I suck as a cyber-pirate).I also thanks for the close personal memory that you shared with us in Alzheimer´s disease. I have at least 2 relatives with this sickness (or maybe other type of brain degenerative disease) .Because it allowed me (at least) to understand more about the perspective of the person that are ¿housing the diseased  or ill patient? (spouse for example). Its very important to see the health problems in the caretakers especially in the informal aspect (relatives and normally female that has to leave studies or job or worse do all of them in occidental culture) . A disease like this is very hard weight and its very normal phenomenon in Latin-American countries that are in still trapped in the gap between ""developed or industrial countries "" with undeveloped countries trying neoliberal policies to fix dictatorships regimens or ""communist "" (populist) governments. In a sense the young or working labor people has to choose to be selfless for the family or only consider family the people that ""can lift their weight"" or still have their uses.¡Well I better find a credit card to certificate myself for studying in summer!

Besides i'm like most young people very limited in my finances.
