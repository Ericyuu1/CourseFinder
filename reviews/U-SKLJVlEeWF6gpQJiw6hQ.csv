the video quality is so bad. The speakers where always under exposed. I know
this is a course about photography and not about video, but they do share
things in common like a how a good lighting is so important.  I think if you are a

I also appreciate the recommended online sources & the Facebook group page for class participants. The group page is useful in making up for what I consider the weakest component of the course, peer reviews. Though I enjoyed the opportunity to practice putting into words the concepts we were covering in case, I received so few & such brief peer reviews as to not be helpful. :( Given the pace of technology, would it be possible to provide some updated material on smartphones?

I hope I did not misunderstand but I believed that I would have some feedback from the professionals teaching the course and not just other students.  Also, I think that Professor Sullivan's sections could have been more effective -- I had a hard time following him / his points without stopping the presentations and re-listening or referring to the written notes.  He spoke much too fast and jumped from one point to the next too quickly to absorb the content.  Also, and this is particularly surprising in a fine-arts related course: Prof. Sullivan showed example photos to make his points but often they were not on the screen for more than a few seconds, making it impossible to consider the visual points he was making.

In this course, Peter and Mark both seem to have that down as they provided illustration after illustration to convey the complexities of the mathematics and physics that are part inherent elements in modern picture taking. Peter's conversational ease in front of as well as behind the camera and his ability to validate and affirm learners who are finding their way made me want to get up and go school every day. Mark has a vision all his own and I could see the musical side of him evidenced in his approach to photography.I am beyond grateful to have found these courses offered by Coursera in my field as a road warrior multimedia journalist, and am ready to apply what I learned in this latest update out in the field.

These are very practical knowledge if you want to develop a career to be a skilled photographer and to learn from the very experienced lecturers here. The practical part of learning about the composition of photography came very late in around week 3 or 4 of the content where we talk about vantage point, framing and stuff. So if you have had basic knowledge about photography like the relationship between ISO, shutter speed and aperture, week 3 or 4 will likely be the thing that you want to start with, because that's where the practical work come rolling by.
