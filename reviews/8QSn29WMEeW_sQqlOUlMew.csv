94183052~COURSE!~8QSn29WMEeW_sQqlOUlMew,1637021252454,1,0,M​y low score of this course is primarily because of the appropriation of American Indian culture . I feel that the indigenous people of America have been loud and clear over the past 7 years that they would like the usuage of non American Indian people practicing things such as ‘spirit animals’ and ‘medicine wheel’ to cease and desist. The inclusion of these practices in this study is wrong and harmful. There are a myriad of other methods that could be used in this course to gain the same result without the hurt and disrespect. I feel it is particularly I’ll fitting within this course primarily because many of us who wish to enter the Art Therapy filed as a career will take these methods on board and teach or utilize them within their practice thereby perpetuating this hurt. I hope that whoever reads this will take this on board and change these modules to something more appropriate. Thank you. Georgia Barber ,0,0,Georgia Barber,94183052

While there is nothing wrong with guided meditations or online therapy sessions, it is not what I wanted. I wanted to learn about the history of using art in healing; what is the science that makes this a valid form of supplemental treatment; how do the arts help heal physical maladies vs. mental health issues; what are the best practices when employing the arts in healing?, etc. It appears the curriculum goes further into specific art modalities later on in the course, which might be interesting, but I have given up on it.

5099922~COURSE!~8QSn29WMEeW_sQqlOUlMew,1632365194625,3,0,"I took this course because it was the only one of its kind offered through a university for which a certificate could be obtained. It was not a difficult course and it took me back to the 70's with its ""New Age"" philosophy and guided imagery to find one's spirit animal and to meditate. Because I come from a strong Judaic Christian background I found a lot of this ""hokey"" and simplistic. However, when I saw the projects the students were creating, one with a Christian background who told about his project that included Jesus and the Stations of the Cross, plus Mary, the instructor's good work with cancer patients I was glad I stuck with it. I like the organization of the class in terms of including dance and movement and music and intuitive collage and art, all very basic but a good introduction for people to have tools to heal when going through grief, depression, or loss. It was very frustrating to not be able to upload part two of my project. I got help through the Coursera technicians, and I am thankful, but I still don't understand why it was so difficult to upload a file when I could do it through the ""thread"" and for the Coursera technicians. This is my fourth Coursera course and being a life-long learner, I will  continue to take Coursera courses. The instructors for this course might want to consider balancing their curriculum to include or mention praying the Psalms of the Bible or looking at the masterpieces of museum art to give the course some more intellectual depth and appeal to the students who have a more traditional background.",0,0,Mary H.

Went to the Help forum and saw several postings from other Coursera students having the same problem.  It would be nice if this could be fixed. The instructors should have an accurate record of how many people are actually in their class for one thing.Now about the course... The instructors seem like very compassionate, dedicated and knowledgeable people. I love that they chose to create a course about healing with the arts. It's so important. Sadly the course curriculum and content just wasn't for me. Way too many videos that became redundant.Too much time spent on meditating in the videos.Very little in the way of presenting relevant information about why art is so beneficial to healing. Encouraging students to be creative with their journals and then micromanaging how students were to do their journaling.The discussion forums were hard to follow and too vague about what the discussion content was.If you are already an artist and you already use art as a healing modality successfully, you might find this course somewhat frustrating.  Go ahead and give it a try though.  I stuck with it into Week 2 because there were some really beneficial things about the course.  In the end, however,just not a good fit for me.Again, the instructors were wonderful and I wish them both continued success with this endeavor. ",0,2,Kim Cruickshank,60395809

Will you learn in-depth knowledge about healing through artistic mediums? No. Neither art forms nor healing processes are explained much beyond the basics. So if you are looking for scientific evaluation and professional applications, this course is probably not for you. However,  if you are interested in creative self-expression, this course will be inspiring and gently guide you through exploring different art forms. The guided imagery journeys are quite lovely, especially if you really take the time to complete your journal entries. There were aspects of this course I really loved, like the spirit animal journey, the journal process itself, the invitations for self-exploration, the facebook group, the genuine nature of the main facilitator and the overall informal setting. This course has given me a lot of encouragement and a great opportunity to express myself authentically. On the down-side, not all videos are worth watching. Some contributions from other teachers and students I could have done without, but it was all so well-intended that I readily went along with the syllabus. So if you would like to unite your inner artist with your inner healer, this course could be a blessing and stepping stone for more creativity and well-being in your life. ",0,22,Lisa Jonas,65415356

The positivity I felt from the instructors was also healing, I'm sure it was an important part of the process of self healing, proposed by the course. It was clear that they really enjoyed providing it, sharing themselves with us. There were also many inspiration from many people who shared their own processes in the videos, their knowledge and experience which apart of being just good to watch, was a nice recognition of the efficacy of this approach. What I missed though was a few theoric background of the approach, the history of it, a general idea of the areas it comprises, to better understand how the healing and the therapist who uses this approach works. Since I recognize reading about a process that you are living and has to be organic, natural, unfiltered, without criticism to be effective can interfere with it, I was glad not to find any theoric content during the course but was expecting it to be in the final section. So this would be my suggestion, it would do no harm to the people who are not interested in the theory, since would be provided after the conclusion of the course and as an option to read/access the content or not, and would be helpful to the people who actually are interested in the theme beyond the experiencing of it.

It was very interesting for me to see how so many people responded to the INNER CRITIC assignment. Although I have been an artist for many year I had no idea that art was so healing.In the beginning I really battle to understand what was expected of me, so thanks to the Support Group I eventually got there. Also when Mary chatted about the FINAL PROJECT I was not sure if it was the end of each WEEK, but I soon found out only later that it was something we needed to do for WEEK 6.My only dislike was that I really stressed having to find a way to upload the FINAL PROJECT Video of myself. I have never loaded anything onto YOUTUBE or GOOGLE DRIVE, so this was very frustrating not having any idea of what to do. Eventually a couple of kind friends came to my rescue. I think that Clear instructions as how to do this, would be very helpful to people like me.Thank you Mary and Michael for setting up this course, you are clearly passionate about what you do!
