4518301~COURSE!~Is-lr2N_Eei_Tw6L_IWP-g,1584164081428,1,0,"Don't believe what coursera says Coursera advertised the course as ""at your own place"" what a lie. After completing the course I had to pay another $100 just to wait for the final assignment to be marked to get my certificate. The courses for the specialisation keep getting pushed back, so you have to shell out a subscription for another month while you wait for them to come out. I've spent far more time paying just to wait than actually doing any of the course materials.",0,3,Nicholas Shannon,4518301
6758970~COURSE!~Is-lr2N_Eei_Tw6L_IWP-g,1578918604507,1,0,"Authors do not  give a damn about it, there are more water than in average PhD thesis  and as many practical skills as chicken has teeth. There are bloopers in  course video that no one bothered to reshoot. Course listeners must do  tasks, that should be done in SQL, in R and custom JAVA soft (which  produces xlsx as output) and submit answers in pptx (sic!) to be  peer-reviewed. Due to peer-review and lack of course listeners it could  be hard to meet deadlines (I submitted my final task 2 weeks ago with  forum campaign “let’s unite and help each other to review” but sill lack  reviewers.)The  only thing that is theirs and hardly available opensource is clinical  models presentation but it is described in the same terms, but way  shorter, in the two articles of one of the course authors.",0,3,Kabakov Borys,6758970
90707732~COURSE!~Is-lr2N_Eei_Tw6L_IWP-g,1649606278799,2,0,"Weeks 1 through 4 of this course indicates a function of ""teaching"" the material and the theory of ETL processes and data models.

However, week 5 is the practical use of these teachings with no examples on how to actually do this process outside of the dry speakings and videos of Dr. Kahn. 

Dr. Kahn's presentation and reading ability is on full display, but what is not on full display is how to actually do what he is describing.  I feel it would be more beneficial on teaching these techniques and connecting the theory with application through practical quizzes at the end of week 1 through 4 instead of multiple choice quizzes.  

I also have issues with the quizzes that require an 80% to pass with only 6 questions where I had some answers marked ""incorrect"" when they weren't the ""most correct"" answer. This is not how the real world operates and definitely not how to teach a very practical subject matter. 

I have a BA in mathematics and have spent the last 10 years as a data analyst and taking this 6 course program to learn more about how to apply it to the healthcare field. I did not feel this course was well designed for coursera and clearly meant for an in-person classroom. I believe it would do the students taking this course to relook at how this topic is presented.

Also, it is necessary to relook at the websites provided in all the videos. I have found a key website to be out of date on ""Example: Transforming MIMIC Patient to OMOP Person Steps 1 and 2"" video in the FINAL week.

Having a student review 3 assignments is incredibly short sighted unless the final grade for ones own assignment is then averaged. Having a 3:1 grade:submitt just doesn't make sense.

This course DESPERATELY needs to be re-evaluated. The meat is there but not the potatoes.",0,3,Edgar Qualkenbush,90707732
