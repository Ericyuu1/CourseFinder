The assignments are poorly thought out, overly rigid for requiring very specific methods and mediums, and the peer review system is kind of a joke.  If you're sincerely interested in learning IXD and creating a high quality portfolio piece, this course is moderately helpful toward that end, but you'll need to supplement it with lots of outside reading and in person coursework to really get where you want to be.  If you're weighing whether to attend an in-person course or program or go with this specialization to save some $, just know that you'll get what you pay for.  ",0,9,Ryan Southard,509344

The curators, in my opinion, should be more on top of things. I discovered a few dead links, some instructions are vague and mediocre (It’s ironic, given that the course is about user experience.), and the majority of the examples are outdated (Examples for 2012: A lifetime in the UX/UI world).I would recommend the course, but there are some caveats.",0,0,Pedro Beça Pereira,2653896
