This course covers the download of the Tableau Public tool, then creating one sheet (and map graph) with fields form one table, then another sheet by using a join from two tables. All that on maps and there are some other small items that will be mentioned. Expected a bit more from an ""intermediate"" course but not too disappointed. ",0,0,Jack Glinka,84096948
