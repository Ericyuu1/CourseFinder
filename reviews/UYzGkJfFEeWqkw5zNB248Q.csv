Not that any of that matters as most quiz questions are true/false making quizzes nearly impossible to fail on retake.

47297605~COURSE!~UYzGkJfFEeWqkw5zNB248Q,1674442437248,4,0,"The content of the CAMERA CONTROL course is exceptionally good, especially if you put the time and effort into really practicing the concepts laid out. The course pushes you to set intentions about the kind of photos you want to create, and then challenges you to go out and create those photos using the various technical concepts that are taught each week. If you want to do well, really do your best to take a lot of photos related to each concept. For example, when learning how depth of field works, I encourage you to setup your camera in one place and take a shot at each aperture setting (that is, one shot at f1.8, one at f2, another at f4, f8, f11, f16, and f22), so that you can see how the depth of field in the scene changes. Too many projects seem to get submitted where this isn't done, and it's unfortunate, because then you don't learn. Also, when submitting a project, I wish people would make sure they carefully read what's asked for in terms of the writeups. Some have you do a short one or two sentences before you start the project, and then tie in the last few sentences to how you went about meeting the intentions that were behind those first few sentences. Most projects ask you to relay the technical settings you choose to make your photo and describe how those settings impacted the image you created. Many people didn't do that either. So read each part carefully. One other thing that might be an issue for some is the language barrier - when I took the course, a lot of Spanish speaking students were submitting work and writing in Spanish, which is okay - I was able to screenshot the work and there are websites and apps that will translate the langagues in the screenshot. I then used Google Translate to write my response to the submission and I hope it helped the other Spanish speaking learners. But then, with my own work, when it was reviewed by people who don't speak English - I found that they would just write one word responses. So if you are reading this, and thinking about taking this course, note that you might need to do that. Luckily you don't have to know what language is written for these translation programs, they seem very good at detecting what's been written and it will tell you if it was Spanish, or French, etc.",0,0,Steven Hanju Lee,47297605

I've always played with the 'M' setting but fell back on the auto, landscape, action and portrait settings when I wanted to make sure the pic would turn out. I've read many books and been coached by a few pros. The advantages in investing the time into this course were both the clear, concise and brief lecture videos but more importantly to me being held accountable for the information in the quizzes. The peer review was also instructive and interesting as I rarely if ever make a photograph of something I'm not interested in. Being tasked with picking up the camera and making it produce a certain type of image was a new and instructive experience that reinforced the lessons. If you are like me and need to get away from the crutch of the camera assist settings or just need to learn them as a beginner then this course is highly recommended.",0,0,Joe Ebert,3331868

And I'm looking forward to another courses of this specialization.I'm a music student with bachelor's degree in Computer Science and dozens of coursera certificates (from the times they were free), I'm curious about everything. I used to say that I'll learn to paint when I retire :) But it turned out that I can do pretty good photos without having to wait until retirement. It's not the same thing, of course, but it's a visual art.This course and ""Cameras, Exposure, and Photography"" teached me a lot and brought so much joy into my life.I'm not planning to make money as a photographer, but I'm happy to have an opportunity to create better and better photographs.  Thank you, Prof. Glendinning and Prof. Sullivan. And thanks to everyone who helped to create this course. My photos can be found here, in case you're curious: https://www.flickr.com/photos/140271759@N03/Most of them are made with my old cheap digital camera, only a few with a new DSLR. I would never have the courage and motivation to buy it without your courses. Thanks again for all the happiness photography brings into my life :)",0,1,Jeyana Morozenko,244607

Thanks to this series of courses, I began to work better on my photograph skills, and I found it really interesting and amazing. The only thing I'm not quite pleased with is the payment of the full course, without the upgrades, I just can't review others' works and that's disappointing. But anyway, I will continue this specialism and I hope it's the right choice. ",0,0,Joan Yao,8966734
