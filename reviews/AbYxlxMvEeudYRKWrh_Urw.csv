21203638~COURSE!~AbYxlxMvEeudYRKWrh_Urw,1655557192765,1,0,"I can see the lecturer is really passionate about taking around these topics. However, the course is not well organised. Too much information contains in a slide, especially word font is pretty small in figures and tables, so the audience might be distracted and can't catch the key points. Although the lecturer provided the course structure in the beginning, it is not clear enough and I am really confused of the takeaway concepts in every video. In some after-video tests, the answers are provided. I don't know if these are the hints that the lecturer intentionally provided or that he accidentally revealed. I don't recommand you take this courses, but if you can finish the course within the 7-day trial, then go for it. ",0,0,Jacqueline Lee,21203638
