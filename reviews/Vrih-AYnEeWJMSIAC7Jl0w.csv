Very little teaching on any theory or even basic understanding of Network Analysis. ""Here is how to use this software which we developed ..."". Basically every video. ",0,0,Jonathan Morgan,5728597

43138901~COURSE!~Vrih-AYnEeWJMSIAC7Jl0w,1619448191615,3,0,"The content of each week was good (except for the RNA-seq lectures which I had no clue what the instructor was talking about!) but I think there was no integration between them and it was hard to connect everything in my brain. Also, lots of lectures were about how to analyze a list of differentially expressed genes but no one ever explained how to identify differentially expressed genes! which is why I'm stuck in the first step of my project.Although I wasn't very satisfied by all the lecturers, I think Neil Clarke did a great job at explaining how some methods work. Overall, I don't feel like I've learned network analysis in systems biology. Don't expect this course to make you an expert in the field.",0,3,Yalda Yaghooti,43138901

Perhaps a greater focus on offline techniques would be better if the Mayaan lab cannot invest the resources to maintain a bunch of servers.,0,0,Alok Saldanha,9381804

E.g. why should I know what javascript library is used to plot bar graphs in Enrichr or what is the meaning of a certain argument for a tool I didn't use. The section on processing sequencing data but also other could use more on-hands approach. Still, although sometimes a bit boring, I learned a lot. ",0,0,Adam Husár,34686108

13938351~COURSE!~Vrih-AYnEeWJMSIAC7Jl0w,1559743084887,4,0,"Very good course. Subjects are explained very well. Only downside is that it
oscillates between these explanations to very dry demonstrations of specific
tools. That is not to say they are not demonstrated well and thoroughly, but I
prefer the theoretical background. Also, it's a shame that not all of the sites are completely functions - I was particularity disappointing by not being able to log on to the crowdsourcing site.  ",0,0,Doreen Ben-Zvi,13938351
