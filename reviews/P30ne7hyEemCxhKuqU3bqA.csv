12742716~COURSE!~P30ne7hyEemCxhKuqU3bqA,1628413296204,3,0,Very nice lecturer but the course appears as if it was created in the late 1990s and then superficially updated with bits of deep learning. It feels more like a 'History of computational vision' course. Where is the in-depth discussion of recent computational frameworks and models of vision of the past 10 years?,0,0,Matthias Treder,12742716

351998~COURSE!~P30ne7hyEemCxhKuqU3bqA,1589631397174,3,0,This course while it had some good points in terms of content clearly need to be revised and the quizzes need more questions and better guidance. Working through the issues with the quizzes became a huge time suck.,0,1,Rick Durham,351998

1235333~COURSE!~P30ne7hyEemCxhKuqU3bqA,1618598961485,5,0,"The course instructor is excellent in approaching the
 parallels between vision in humans and machines, and how these parallels contributed to prolific exchange of theory and technology development between cognitive and computing science. The content is 
very thorough and relevant for both cognitive and computational 
students, researchers and professionals. It's a good and gentle introduction to current machine learning, specifically neural network algorithms.",0,0,Gehazi Bispo,1235333

Plus you get to understand how your eyes work.Big thanks to the University of Colorado, Boulder!",0,0,Chibuzor Ndubisi,42578928
39397067~COURSE!~P30ne7hyEemCxhKuqU3bqA,1587602111192,5,0,"A great course, one I would certainly recommend! As the name of the course suggests, you not only learn about visual perception from the computer science point of view but also gain a much deeper understanding of how our mind works and all possibilities are explored in depth. I started this course to learn about Computer Vision, and though the course is not too heavy on actual implementations, the rather unconventional approach of linking concepts to how our eyes and brain perceive visual information more than makeup for it. It was a great experience.",0,1,Yash Sharma,39397067
