I think that the third party  API doesn't avaliable currently, for that reason, doesn't possible to receive the data form the third party API URL end point.For other hand,  the fourth part of this specialization was excellent. i learnt about asynchronous functions, and many new methods ( fetch, await, then, promises, etc.)This course covered my expectations.",0,0,Miguel Marquez,78316333

79671145~COURSE!~dR-lFGvbEeufExI7Hdi1lQ,1641909006721,5,0,"Thanks to the teacher for the course and specialization in general! I am new to JS. Before the course, I knew a couple of the simplest commands. Now I can write working web applications on my own and can find a solution in the documentation, even if I don't know how to cope with the task myself! Great course for beginners like me. I realized what really has JS inside, how it works. Before this course, I started to take a couple of others, but at some point I stopped understanding what was happening. Here I understood everything from the first to the last word. The only remark is the sound of the lectures. My English is not very good and sometimes I translated subtitles, but they are often incorrect, this made some material difficult to lexically perceive.",0,1,Irina Azizova,79671145
