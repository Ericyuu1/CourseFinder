96999760~COURSE!~ejOz7RDUEei99hK0xs-tsg,1653593108261,1,0,"The Problem with this course is that is neck tied with IBM Cloud Service.
 And,  IBM Cloud is horrible. You will get strangled and will not be able to finish the Course. ---more details---
 It will allow you to create a user account with login.ibm.com. But will fail to create an IBM Cloud Account with Services. Error message during creation. OK, being a persistent and waisting handful of emails you will eventually succeed once and will waste code on it.

 In that manner, I  was able to finish “Python for Data Science, AI & Development”, but get finally nailed down and halted for the last 4 weeks on “Tools for Data Science”.  Reason being: locked out of account. Can’t even get on login.ibm.com.
 IBM Help desk sends automated generic responses which don’t have anything with the problem.
 The creation of more additional IBM Cloud accounts has been proven futile as course code is one time only and IBM cloud service creation will result in an error. After weeks of trying to get somebody over there at the IBM help desk to tick the box “unlock”, and not getting it, I’m forced to retire from this “Data Science Fundamentals with Python and SQL” course.

 I will complete this section “Tools for Data Science” using Github sharing of Jupyter Notebook, as some suggested, but other sections in “Data Science Fundamentals with Python and SQL” cannot go on without access to IBM Cloud Services.
 Since I have paid for this certificate, I will ask for a full refund as the course owner is blocking the completion of the course, by locking services out.

 Possible solutions for future encounters with the same problem:

 1. Avoid the potential creation of a problem in the first place.
 This means, detaching the course from IBM Cloud Services and don’t create dependencies on unreliable third party services. 2. Make sure that a third party is doing the job properly if you must use them.
 Get the IBM Help desk sorted in a manner that the user who is being locked out can get somebody to deal with him in a timly manner (in this case timely manner means hours, not weeks as it is now) 3. Sort it on your own by improvising temporary solutions.
 Get the Course creator to assign additional code for the course so the user can create new services and try again. Yes, the user will still loose all of his previous work, but at least he will be able to proceed with future tasks. ---likely outcomes--- 1. Probably, no one will read this, as help desks and forums are not meant to improve quality and user support. They exist for l’art pour l’art cosmetics purposes.
 2. If somebody eventually reads this, he will do nothing about it, as it is not in his wage bracket.
 3. Course will remain with the same problems and completion percentage as it is.
 4. People will ask for their money back and avoid you in future.

 ---unlikely outcome---
 The solution will be provided.   Kind Regards    ",0,0,Milorad Pasic,96999760

They barely require any thought and absolutely don't practice or reinforce any of the skills you learn - I'm pretty sure you could complete them with no prior knowledge based on the instructions alone. I learn better from doing things, not just hearing about them.Usually, this was earn a 3 star rating from me, but the final assignment is even worse. The 'dashboard' you create is a single graph, and the rest of the final assignment is hosting the jupyter notebook on the IBM Cloud... except whoever set up the course forgot to actually upload the tutorial to do so.

As has been outlined by other reviewers, this is mostly a bad ad for IBM's Watson and there is little actual instruction for actually using Python.  As a background I'm a EE with a lot of hardware coding experience (Verilog as well as Perl).  I completed a specialization in Python from another provider and this gave me quite a bit of help as those classes were clear, with a good progression.  In addition I've now written a bit of Python for work so I have a good base.  This IBM course has, at best, cursory instruction on using Python, Numpy, and Pandas.  The instructions are not clear, with poor sentence structure, and terrible grammar, making it difficult to follow along.  Further, Watson is a confusing mess with instructions that use a prior UI, making it tough to figure out exactly what needs to be done to set up an environment.  Avoid.  Just avoid.  Go to UMich or JHU.  Anywhere but IBM.  The only thing I *did* get from this class is that I don't want to go into Data Science: living in Jupyter notebooks is miserable.

Working with Jupyter workspace and IBM Cloud was also not very user friendly. There were constant errors on bucket names and endpoints while running the code, which left me confused on what was happening (I believe this was the case with other users in the course as well, as seen from the discussion threads for Week 5). For instance, the tutorial IBM Object Storage does not clearly state which endpoint to use. For my project I ended up using an endpoint that was created in my credentials inside the JSON object. Due to this my code always gave an error. As it turns out, the correct endpoint to be used was listed elsewhere under IBM Cloud, but this was not clearly explained. I had to check with the course instructors to resolve the issue. I must say that the course instructors were very helpful in answering my questions and clarifying all my doubts promptly.

Wouldnt it make more sense if the two topics were covered together? and no I did not need to know what a JSON file is before learning how to import it. It's enough to teach me how its structured.And this philosophy is carried all over the course. It seems like IBM is confusing the forest for the trees. The module working with webscrapping had two vidoes explaining the communication between client and resource, and two other videos on web scrapping itself. IBM, listen to me, teach me practical skills, I can use beatuful soup without understanding how it works under the hood. Spend that time on things that actually matters. Okay fine, the course is a mess, but did I learn something useful? yes, but that's thanks to the many tutorials I read/watched on other websites. This course jumps from covering the absolute basics to flashing an advanced concepts and moving on. For example, we learned how to create a simple dataframes, but grouping and aggregation, the stuff that actually matters, was only flashed on the screen for 5 seconds in a video on APIs. How am I supposed to do analysis without learning about aggregation? Well thanks to youtube I can. If this course is useful for anything its to point you to the right direction. Self study is essential.The lab sessions are borderline useless, 90% of the exercises are super basic and were covered in the lectures, but are these any example datasets to work on? is there a multi step analysis to complete? are there any problems that go beyond creating a smile 1 line of code? not really.

I have some programming background, so expected the course to seem a bit slow having been introduced to topics such as basic data types in Python before. Week 1 material, for example, was simple enough to go through in less than a day. As the course progressed to more complex and interesting topics (e.g. APIs, Webscraping, etc.), however, the course seemed incredibly rushed. Instead of understanding the set-up, it felt as though the lectures simple flashed multi-lines of code. The labs similarly seemed to grow in complexity, but shrink in explanations. The labs often incorporated libraries or methods/functions that had not been referenced in the lectures, often with little added explanation/introduction. Similarly, the incorporation of the Watson engine seemed like unnecessary advertising. It was not necessary to understand Python for data science and AI as part of the exercises. So much time was spent explaining how to add arrays, while it took 4 minutes to go through summarizing dealing with csv, JSON, and XML files. It also seems that later lectures had more typos in slides, again giving the impression that the later sections were rushed. Even the final lab randomly referenced a library for processing image files, which seemed to come out of left field. The course could've stopped at Week 4 or maybe split the focus between pandas and numpy between Weeks 4 and 5. Or more focus on exception handling or classes and objects might've been useful. Use of Jupyter notebook is helpful (it really adds to nice-looking labs), but I think it would've been better to have files/resources that could be downloaded and saved locally. That way, any files written/read could also be inspected more closely. Given the title of the course (and IBM as the provider), I would've expected more.

There are many errors in the text and in the video narration, and the videos aren't well edited. The errors are mostly small, but they disrupt learning and give the impression that the course was written in a rush, without sufficient proof-reading or testing. In addition to typos (including in the video scripts), the logic of the course also isn't great: methods and JSON, for example, are both mentioned many times before they are explained. Methods relating to specific data types are discussed in week 1, but methods as a concept isn't introduced until later. JSON data are referred to a lot, but it is only in the final week's lab that JSON is defined and explained. There are also long-reported bugs in the lab interface, which are not adequately investigated or fixed (reports of being unable to share to Github Gists since early last year, but the only responses to these are workarounds or ""it works for us""). None of this inspires me to try other IBM offerings.In short, r​ather than teaching students to code in Python or analyse data, this course is more of a ""taster"".

Last week's graded assignment is about compiling an already existing code in the jupyter notebook and you will waste a considerable amount of time trying to submit your work via IBM's cloud rather than actually working on the code itself or on understanding the underlying notions and concepts. In summary, this course certainly has a potential and can be improved on various levels (instructors availability, problem solving, etc.), but if you already know programming I believe this course will be of little to no use for you, except if you want to spend some time and money during lockdowns. If you do not, you will probably get a grasp of the basics of Python programming but, in any case, do not expect to improve your problem solving skills. Nevertheless, if you combine this course with a personal involvement in solving programming problems via Python it will could be beneficial, however I am not sure if it's worth the money.

9753252~COURSE!~ejOz7RDUEei99hK0xs-tsg,1603905632862,2,0,"The course is super frustrating, the robot voice for the videos makes it so difficult to digest the information, the cadence and focus on certain words is completely wrong, so it makes it so hard to understand, especially when introducing new terms. Given that a lot of the information is presented on slides its really tricky to read at your own pace with the correct intonations and also see the code on the video. It seems really lazy to not have a person with subject knowledge read the video material in a much more engaging way (as with all other Coursera courses I've tried) - this would make the material much easier to engage with and less like I've just installed a text to voice reader on a wikipedia page. I also think some more real life application based would make it much easier to engage with the material - when I've looked at other courses (e.g. Khan academy, codeacademy, they at least explain 'for loops can be applied for example in XXX'. The labs are good, but the videos have to be some of the least engaging videos on programming that I have ever come across!!Also, Also, a lot of terms are introduced without any explanation as to their function. In the videos sometimes terms are just introduced on the screen e.g. '_init_ ' but with no explanation whatsoever as to what this means or when it's used. This is meant to be a beginner course and provide knowledge to apply in a workplace setting going forward, but I find myself constantly googling to get background information on Python code. As an example, I messaged my friend (who is teaches python in a university) who gave a brief explanation to 'init: ""Short for initialise. When you create an object of any type, you either create a real one or a default one. So for the circle example, a default circle could be the unit circle, but you (as a programmer) may want a 5 inch circle so you would use the class constructor to initialise / override the default values"" .This kind of simple background explanations would go a long way to actually teaching people how to understand what the code is doing, and the background of it and why you use it, so that you are actually more capable of applying this in a future setting. It also helps make the course a lot more human, rather than trying to teach it in a way where you can only remember the code but not actually understand what any of it means or does!

I rely 0% of outside resources on Week 01 & 02. * Week 03 & Week 04 - Topics are getting more challenging, and the explanation quality starting to go down. But it is still ""pass"". Thus, I begin to rely on outside resources such as Youtube videos and Udemy Python class that I purchased (which is cheaper than Coursera) to understand Week 03 & Week 04 materials. But I can still pull this off and get through Week 03 & 04 using the videos and labs in this class. * Week 05 - API, HTTP, URL, webscraping topics are so difficult to understand by listening to the videos in this class. I rely close to 100% on outside resources such as Youtube tutorials, Udemy class info, and another Coursera Specialization such as ""Python for Everybody"" in order to pass through Week 05!!!

Personally from week 3 on it just felt like that they don'T really wanna teach you coding but just showing you how it's done. For example they show you how you can Webscrape or convert dictonairies to lists but you can't really code them by yourself.

Also the examples could have been a lot simpler and clearer. 
Sometimes the examples even confused me about a topic that I already knew about perfectly.

You get a general understanding of basic Python elements, syntax, useful libraries and some examples of really simple data analysis. The main disadvantage of this course is a couple of exercises at the end of hands-on labs that do not correspond to the  course material by their level of difficulty. To me, as a person with zero programming background, it felt like I've just been explained addition on examples like 2+3 and then asked to add something like exponential numbers and square roots. Judging by the discussion forums, I am not the only one who felt this way, which was the only thing to keep me from thinking that I am too dumb for this and giving up. I believe those tasks are great as extra challenges but must be marked accordingly.

I find Python more functional but far less user friendly. What helped a lot
here was that I have a background in windows and pc hardware. I also have a
little experience with Linux and .bash scripting. I’ll admit, this course would
have been much more difficult without the computer knowledge I already had. I’m currently working full-time trouble shooting large 3D printers 40 hours a week. I’ve
been pondering what to go to graduate school for. This course has helped with
that decision. I’m leaning toward a masters in the applied data science. I plan on taking the other data science and applied data
science courses on Coursera as well. Any and all continued learning I can get
will be valuable. What was most challenging? Learning the syntax and structure
of the python language. I’m still learning it and it’s going to take quite a
lot of effort to master it. Attention to detail is an absolute must in
programming or coding—albeit a short script or manipulating a data set. Also, I found that the Anaconda suite was the best choice
to complete the course. It was a little more user friendly than the bare-bones IDLE/Python combination. ",0,0,Anthony N Guarino,44777234
