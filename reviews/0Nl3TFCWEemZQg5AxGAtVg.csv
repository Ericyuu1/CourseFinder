2747324~COURSE!~0Nl3TFCWEemZQg5AxGAtVg,1616104280843,5,0,"Very good. Being in
e-learning mode which facilitates and shortens distances, at the same time
hinders the always essential interaction in these topics, discussion is
essential.Completing the
course was not easy, studying among the small periods after work required some
dedication and effort.However, the
excellent explanations of all the speakers in the various modules in
conjunction with the various reading material supporting the study made each
module attractive.In particular, the
main difficulty I had was the fact that English is not my natural language
which led me to listen in English, mentally translate to Portuguese and then
respond to the various tests in English.This course has
brought to me the opportunity to understand all the involvement of the IHR, its
implementation and essentially in this period COVID understand many of the
decisions taken nationally or internationally concerning health matters or
political.It also helped me
to realize the need to help my institution, in the search and implementation of
the best systems of health support at work and prevention in the workplace.Many thanks to
all.",0,1,Luís Rodrigues,2747324
