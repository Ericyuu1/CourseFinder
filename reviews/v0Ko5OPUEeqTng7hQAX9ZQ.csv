743086~COURSE!~v0Ko5OPUEeqTng7hQAX9ZQ,1623725786092,4,0,"T​he course was helpful for my review of skills in biopython programming. However, some questions in the quiz were confusing: e.g. the protein is an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase but the answer to the question about where its domain binds is DNA; also, multiple codons correspond to a certain amino acid and not the other way around as implied by another question. But overall, the learning experience was easy and great.",0,1,Rafael Navarro,743086
