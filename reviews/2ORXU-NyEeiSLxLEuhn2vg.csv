115953299~COURSE!~2ORXU-NyEeiSLxLEuhn2vg,1667470479991,5,0,This course was a great learning experience where I learnt to evaluate the program by breaking it down into different components and analyze each component rather than finding a binomial answers if the project worked or not.  This was similar to assessment for learning.,0,0,Dr. Neeti Bhat,115953299
99277590~COURSE!~2ORXU-NyEeiSLxLEuhn2vg,1656692507358,5,0,"As a public health practictioner who has a graduate degree, I wanted to discover courses that could enhance my professionalism and comeptency the domain of evaluation. With an undegraduate in Health Behavior Science, and a graduate degree in Public Health Practice, I took approximately 2 or 3 evaluation courses in total.I was absolutely astounded by the quality of content provided by John Hopkins University. For $50, you are able to obtain a multitude of presentations deliberating on evaluation on the global health level. I do not work in global health but I am currently a grant project director. I felt sincerely felt obligated to purchase the certificate because the quality of this course is truly equivlent to an undergraduate course. John Hopkins never fails to dissapoint. There is a prime example of why they are one of the best public schools on planet Earth. Major respect and kudos to the creator. ",0,0,Leo Ventresca,99277590
