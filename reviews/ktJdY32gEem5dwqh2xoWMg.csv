Such routine failings and absence of any decent proof-reading invalidate a lot of the quizzes questions.Regarding the substance of the course, we deplore that the course concentrates on biology as if this was the main branch of science, brushing aside a wide spectrum of social sciences.

It comes at a very pertinent time when the world is dealing with more uncertainty than ever, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to separate fact from fiction. I believe that the spread of misinformation is a ""great filter"" for the human race, and will limit us from achieving our potential if we do not take an active role in quashing it. The presentation of the course varied, with videos, readings, assignments and quizzes. I felt this kept the content engaging and fit very well with the take-away lessons of forming your own conclusions through evidence-based thinking. I have a degree in science, and am passionate about the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, but this course has made me want to do more to help foster critical thinking and promote open data for a brighter future.

When I found myself challenged with the readings and content I knew that I would come out the other end of the lesson with the concepts in place. How? Because the design of the evaluations was built that way. The relevance of the course with current issues made me think about interactions with science, social media and personalities around me. I practiced different scenarios using the skills I had obtained while interacting with the people around me.I appreciated the positivity, enthusiasm, energy and depth of the course.

Although I worked in clinical laboratories four decades ago before changing careers, and had a science background, it  was great to refresh and relearn statistical concepts and become more familiar with the role of  both traditional media and social media in the communication of science today.  I am a great fan of Open Access publications as well  and hope that Open Access will become ever more popular and acceptable as  the scientific  world evolves  in the 21st Century.
