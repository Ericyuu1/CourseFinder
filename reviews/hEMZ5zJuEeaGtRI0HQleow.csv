24064062~COURSE!~hEMZ5zJuEeaGtRI0HQleow,1488506216475,3,0,I found the persistent reading of the slides to be a little tedious. A little more interactive activity would have been nice.,0,0,Brandon Loy,24064062
41195652~COURSE!~hEMZ5zJuEeaGtRI0HQleow,1649246058221,4,0,"Content-wise, this course covers all expected bases on understanding health informatics as an active component of healthcare delivery. In multiple instances, I was happily surprised by the direction the discussion went as I learned not only the topic in the title but the health system improvement initiatives in the United States. The integration of the story of Mr. Santana also gives a relatable face to the struggles an average patient (and their family) encounters as they interact with the system.

However, presentation-wise, I feel that there is much room for improvement. Most, if not all, of the time, the experience is basically the speaker reading the usually-wordy/-loaded slides and adding further detailed information (that may be hard to understand especially if one is not well-versed in the US health system). Furthermore, throughout the entire course, the way through which reference/referral to other content in another module/week/section is made does not immediately make sense (“Component X, Unit Y”). At least one of the single-question graded quizzes have answers with the explanation not matching them.

I hope that updates to this important course, in terms of content and in presentation (from loaded slides-based to more MOOC-like), be made soon, as the COVID-19 pandemic practically gave the case for health informatics being an essential part of healthcare.
