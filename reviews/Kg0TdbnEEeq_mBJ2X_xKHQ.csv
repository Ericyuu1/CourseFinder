I reported the problem twice and left it for a few days and still cannot access the cloud workspace. All in all a bit of a waste of time paying for something that I cannot use.

In overall, the project is fantastic and easy to follow.  However, I found some obstacles that made me follow the project pretty much slower than I expected. I wish someone who responsible for this course could see my comment and improve these.1​.  Project was performed on Python which was installed on a server and we work through the Cloud Workspace which is great  because we don't need to install any software on our computer. However, the default folder did not set to the working folder. For those who are not familiar with Python, this might be the first big problem.2​.  The first and most important thing is the data collection. In the project we have two ready-to-use datasets. Again, for the beginners, we don't know how to get the data and how to rate them 0 or 1. Reality,  we could not analyte further if we couldn't get the proper dataset. So, this course will give us more benefit if it shows us how to grab the data and how to rate 0 or 1 on the posiitive/negative comments. If there is another lesson about this, you should inform us to take that course prior taking this one.3​. Cloud Workspace is always unstable and then it works quite slow, especially when we need to scroll up/down. A​gain, I appreciated the course in overall, but I suggested it need some improvement.  Less stars might  make the instructor pay more attention on the comment. Thank you.S​incerely yours,",0,3,Supamas Nitnara,838192
