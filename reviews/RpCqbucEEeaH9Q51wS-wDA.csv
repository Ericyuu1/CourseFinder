36145850~COURSE!~RpCqbucEEeaH9Q51wS-wDA,1555312959012,1,0,Did not get deep into any issue. No real chance to discuss what was better or worse in any of the assignments after delivery (or before). Terrible planning of the activities. Lots of mistakes in the tasks and many times no clear scope of what should be done.,0,1,Javier Vega,36145850
28289060~COURSE!~RpCqbucEEeaH9Q51wS-wDA,1508436868168,1,0,"I found this course to be derivative of the Project Launch course. There was little value added and a lot of repetition throughout the course. There was also the issue of the quiz questions not being specifically covered in the course material. For instance, in the Agile week 6 it was obvious the test questions were copied from an agile specific course as many of the questions were not covered and terms not defined in the previous course material.To improve, I would recommend to combine the Project Launch and Project Planning courses, and make it an 8 week course. With the additional course, create a course entirely devoted to Agile PM as this is an entirely different mindset with a different vocabulary than traditional PM. ",0,1,Lauren Rauchwarter,28289060

The exercises really helped to have a better grasp of the subject matter. The live sessions are really helpful and would have been of great worth for me if not for the important time difference preventing me from participating. The peer review concept really in the absence of live classroom exchanges helps to get other views and perspectives, and good illustrations: very insightful.  It was a pleasure learning from Margareth Meloni . She has been extremely helpful answering all questions submitted on the courses promptly and with required clarification",0,0,Kaul Marie-Christiane,29619449

The instructor brings her extensive PM and leadership experience. I enjoyed both her online lessons and the weekly zoom meetings. The weekly live sessions are great for asking questions most relevant to your projects or getting extra help for complicated concepts. The readings are informative and interesting. The assignments usually take me longer than Coursera estimated time as I don't want to just rush through the homework.  I plan to take other courses offered by this instructor as well. Really appreciate the opportunity to take this wonderful course without disrupting a busy work schedule!,0,0,Mona S,26937233
