18220371~COURSE!~qhYcrJrqEee8VgoNRQtUxA,1615768881119,2,0,"It is unfortunate that I found my assignment cut-and pasted by one of the course participants and claimed my work to be his own! I flagged this with Coursera, but I only received an automated response saying Coursera takes integrity seriously. Coursera said they would look into the alleged plagiarism. However, over the course of a few weeks, I could still see this student moving along, while Coursera sent me no other follow up notes about my complaint. The quality of other assignments submitted also made me wonder if the students understood what was taught and what was required of us.  On the positive side, the cases and readings were good, and I read them all. I wish you well and hope you address the issue that I flagged.",0,0,Rowena Sugay,18220371
56554239~COURSE!~qhYcrJrqEee8VgoNRQtUxA,1600110075640,3,0,"This course is just ok. There's somewhat of a deception running through that we're supposed to take it on faith that the cases we studied were successful based on the techniques or approaches we studied. While I liked all the interviews with the social projects, not a minute was spent on showing us the hard data of the results of all the real-life projects we studied. Did they get financed? At what levels? What were the outputs/outcomes? What return did investors get?  Some critical thinking skills development would have been appreciated to make this course more practical.What are some of the ways to measure social impact? I know it was clearly stated that there's no standardized method but presenting some ways would have been helpful.Annie is an enthusiastic and clear speaker but her flailing hand/arm gestures are really annoying. I liked the assignments. They were a tad painful but well worth it to apply the course content and to engage us. Overall, this is merely an introductory class at best to the subject. Not sure if there's a whole lot to apply to a job or career other than general awareness of the topic and possible sources of funding outside the traditional sources. Thanks!",0,3,David Karasik,56554239
