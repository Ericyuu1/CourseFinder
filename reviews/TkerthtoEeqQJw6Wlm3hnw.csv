41195652~COURSE!~TkerthtoEeqQJw6Wlm3hnw,1646674615170,4,0,"I think that the learning content of this course is excellent: there are knowledge goals that were explicitly being addressed, and the coverage of topics is comprehensive. Perhaps, taking to heart all that are in the course is more than enough for a medical practitioner to function well in any opioid use disorder management setting. The material is understandable even for primary care-level physicians and physician assistants. However, I am only giving four stars out of five because the material was presented entirely as a standard recorded webinar, which, for me, made it quite less effective than the average MOOC. The video cuts are also quite chunky - at least 30 minutes in most cases. I hope that the offerring institution will modify the material to make it look more like a MOOC in the future. Nevertheless, I highly recommend this course to beginner professionnals who wish to have a good grasp of the field in less than a day.",0,0,Aedrian Abrilla,41195652

I am currently working in fields of Addiction Psychiatry and found it really helpful in my Practice. I would like to thank University of Virginia for making it available online in days of Pandemic. Direct learning from experience of such wonderful Psychiatrists with such vast experience is really helpful. ,0,0,Dr Karan Shah,84063427
