If I could make a suggestion, I would add other generative models, such as Deep Belief Nets, and show how the generated data change from DBNs to VAES to GANS with the same dataset. That would give students a better idea of the tradeoffs involved in each of them. ",0,0,Sushanth,3358004

Everything is well explained and knowledge from assignments may be re-used during your own projects. After the whole specialization you can't say that it didn't give you an opportunity to learn how to use Tensorflow. However, it's focused mostly on image processing so if you dislike this topic - it's not for you.",0,0,Ernest Warzocha,1427998
