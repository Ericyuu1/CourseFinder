61016769~COURSE!~hzBOnaPLEeqMgA5iG0QBZw,1594318032278,1,0,I think I came into this project with misguided expectations. I have working knowledge of Python and was hoping to learn how to deploy web apps for generating visualisations etc. The course is not suitable for those without knowledge of HTML syntax. I had difficulty following the instructor (the laggy interface compounded the problem) and the whole learning experience felt very mechanical. I felt like a blind follower. It would be very useful if the instructor could set the context of what he is doing before every step. ,0,1,Guo Xuan Wong,61016769
916636~COURSE!~hzBOnaPLEeqMgA5iG0QBZw,1594001123414,1,0,"Unfortunately, this is not a good course, which is disappointing because I expect more from Coursera. The external virtual desktop platform that Coursera uses (Rhyme) is slow, sluggish and overall user experience is so bad I had to move away from it and work locally. On the platform, there are students constantly messaging to get help with bugs, but the platform is not supported by anyone. It should be noted that the code for this course is provided on the Coursera website, not on Rhyme, I spent so much time trying to find/access it.The project feels very unfinished, there is not enough content - even the basics such as instructions for web deployment (which should be a part of every *web* app tutorial) and the course skips over other major concepts.

It is very easy to download the videos and difficult to get hold of the material, but with ingenuity it is possible.

Maybe if the idea were something other than a task app, I would be inclined to give it a five. With all that in mind, I gave it a four and not something less because I love the learning environment and the lesson's format. I love that I can easily pause the video, access the terminal, access a complete VM - it even has VIM, and that the files are easy to obtain. It's minimal but extremely effective.

Maybe you want students to use the RHYME.  Maybe all the  LAGGING will help you to learn. New learning technique I guess.   Coursera you have to listen . I am reading all these comments and they are saying the same thing.  Idea for all your Guided Projects:-Create an optional section to help user setup the tools needed for the project so they can work on their own machine -Find something quicker than rhyme.

It does demand prior experience in basic web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JS, which is pretty obvious as it lets the course to be more specific on teaching flask and its applications. It was just the right one for me to get started with flask, I just hope to get a similar course on Django from Amit sir . I have learnt about using flask to manage my web pages. Well-set and very well-taught. ",0,0,Harshit Kumar Gupta,17426811

I always wonder what to do next with Python then, started to explore more of it. Now, I'm aware that Flask and Django is used for web development in Python. I could never start learning it myself, but I could find such a great teacher who had actually helped to learn all these from the beginning. I really appreciate of my teacher for my building my basic knowledge about these and I hope I can do a lot stuff if I work hard in future. I urge my teacher to make another advanced web development with Flask or some basic Django web applications. Thank you so much!!",0,1,Souvik Ghosh,53946887
