5554457~COURSE!~WM6vmONeEea9axKK2AGYJA,1518976215348,2,0,"Not a lot of help from mentors/instructors -- you are pretty much on your own when it comes to figuring out what the expectations of the projects are.  The videos cover (very) basic material and you end up spending the majority of your time in the specialization on STACK_OVERFLOW.  There are no examples of what's expected for output of projects and you are at the mercy of the computer grader to try to figure out why your code doesn't work -- a lot of time despite what appears to be the correct output at your terminal.  And the discussion forums are trolled by the students -- and probably the mentors -- but it may take 7 - 10 days to get a response to a question -- of any response at all.  And to be honest, the few responses I received were in the realm of ""This is so easy, why don't you understand it?!""  And there is no final -- or instructor generated code -- to compare to yours at the end of each project to get some feedback on how you're coming as a coder.  Overall, a frustrating experience that honestly could be made better if some examples of input and final code were provided for the projects.

another interesting platform for analysis and visualization. Georeferenced maps
