21453189~COURSE!~aKgfVs3CEeu0KQ5V9fFcUQ,1663909459734,1,0,"T​his is a really useless course. For most of the concepts, PDFs are shared which is not helpful. Instructor should understand that people already have books and resources to refer, what people want is someone to explain those concepts to them. It would have been better if the instructor had explained all the topics rather than sharing PDFs for most of the topics. I​nstructor's English is not good enough, how can she even think of making a course in English when she does not make any difference between the words ""Distinguish"" and ""Disguise"". T​he assignment questions are a total waste. Sentences are copy pasted as it is from the course PDFs into the assignements and still there are so many errors in the assignment questions. For some of them, answers given are wrong and for some of them answers are already marked in bold. T​he only benefit of this course is that you can complete it in a few hours itself.  So, if someone wants a certificate for Research Methodology, then they can go ahead with this course as they can complete the course in a few hours.I​ request Coursera to remove this course. This course doen't deserve to be put here. It decreases credibility of coursera.",0,0,Shubham Khandelwal,21453189
