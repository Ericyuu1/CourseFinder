29444327~COURSE!~wLwaf6GpEeua9hJHpJ2HqQ,1659453565208,4,0,"Good course overall. Not that difficult if you already had level of N3 and can be finished in only one week. For me, it is more like a review. It would be better if the answers or feedbacks be provided. I got 98% in my final exam but I don't know where is my mistake.",0,0,马镓浚,29444327

106941789~COURSE!~wLwaf6GpEeua9hJHpJ2HqQ,1656264816874,5,0,This course is great for anyone who wants to learn about scientific/technological topics through Japanese. It would also be great general practice for someone at JLPT N3/2 level.  The course is well structured: each week starts with  vocabulary and grammar around a particular topic. Gradually more difficult exercises are introduced  over the course of the week culminating in a short interview with a real-life researcher in that topic. I renjoyed every aspect of the course.,0,0,Joanna Dare,106941789

I like the specialist interviews. I have no comments for how to improve the course. I hope that a continuation of this course for JPLT N2 learners will be available on coursera.,0,0,Whitney GONCALVES,105837354
