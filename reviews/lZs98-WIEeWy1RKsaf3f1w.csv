73391634~COURSE!~lZs98-WIEeWy1RKsaf3f1w,1612478232374,2,0,"I found this course too basic, with irrelevant articles, unnecessary videos, and poorly chosen resources (for example NBC News and hyperallergic.com), which don't provide complete information of facts, are not educational, and are unpleasant to navigate (nbcnews is full of annoying videos playing automatically, and sponsored stupid articles with obnoxious images: distraction and pollution. I don't think such material is a decent resource for any kind of research, let alone for students looking for serious knowledge).  ",0,4,Rose Critay,73391634

The person is trying to help me get employment and also in the process, me being better equipped at rejoining the job market again at the age of 55. I chose this as my  first course because of my incessant online presence and  I am interested in the subject. The course material is fluent and well presented.  Short and sweet as they say hey? I feel all important now being an online student and am soaking up all the materials presented.Thank you University of New York for giving me the chance to a brighter future.

34474394~COURSE!~lZs98-WIEeWy1RKsaf3f1w,1613539555278,5,0,"This was an excellent course. I learnt so much. The course really helped me understand the need for 'metaliteracy' and it helped me make sense of the often bewildering multimedia, information-dense world we live in. As a teacher, it gave me many ideas for introducing metaliteracy to my students. I was particularly interested in the areas of copyright and the Creative Commons. The course was intellectually stimulating and also practical. Recommended.",0,1,Ian Fletcher,34474394
