had them as an undergrad!), and the material is mostly clear and concise. 
The homework problems are vital to truly learning the material.  I wish
there were additional optional homework problems, to further hone my knowledge!The flapper servo valve discussion needs some refinement--I'm still unclear
about the feedback mechanism, specifically how torque and pressure balance
out.  I also didn't find the Simulink
portion of the course particularly useful. (While I can see how it would be
immensely useful in industry, it was only used a couple of times in
class.  I don't feel it's required for getting an overview of fluid power
operation.  The examples in the lectures were more than adequate.)Overall, this is an excellent course for engineering graduates to take in
order to brush up on their fluids knowledge and dive into practical fluid power
applications.  It may also be a valuable
course for undergraduates, as long as you’ve already taken physics.  (There are some underlying physics equations
that are important when sizing parts later in the course, but they are not discussed
in detail.)",0,0,Aaron Gendler,25517137

My feedback to the course are the following: some of the videos seemed rushed, and the professors would skip important topics. Also, there is not enough information provided to complete the simulation models. The videos on which simulations are carried out are not explained in detail so that the student can achieve the desired results in the simulation. Overall, it's still an incredible course.
