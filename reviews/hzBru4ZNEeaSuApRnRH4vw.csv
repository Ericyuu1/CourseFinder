45958011~COURSE!~hzBru4ZNEeaSuApRnRH4vw,1578915998212,4,0,I like the online format and the possibility to study at your own pace. This allows one to learn new areas while managing the busy family life in paralell. It would be good to attach some written notes along with the video lectures. These notes could be slightly deeper and provide some more information in particular on the equations used in the lectures. The translation could also be improved. It looks like it has been done by an automatic sound recognizing program and in many cases the translations are completely erroneous. Best regards Anton ,0,1,Anton Lundmark,45958011
