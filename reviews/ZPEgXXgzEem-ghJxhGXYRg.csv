I tried to make comparable tools using the tool create tool.  My version of the tool on Autodesk 360 has less graphical references than the one used in the tutorial.

I think there are less things to learn in comparison to milling so the course is very short. It's doable in a single weekend. During this course I've realized that the whole specialization doesn't teach necessary optimization techniques which is crucial in design for manufacturing to get it correct and become successful. On the other hand I understand that this knowledge comes with experience. The final assignment was demanding if you tried to do it right.",0,0,Ernest Warzocha,1427998
