Especially I think there is too much hand holding for the labs, out of 100 rows of codes I code maybe 2-3%. Many of these don't give much value coding but I want to feel like I did it! Unfortunately now I am left guessing if I have truly mastered the material (and I'm quite sure I haven't, so I will need to re-implement these on my own). Also since you state that calculus and linear algebra are prerequisites then stick with it! You are trying to be too inclusive and there are several part of the courses where I thought it was entirely unecessary because everyone taken Calc and Linalg already has this knowledge.

You won't build anything particularly powerful but it provides a springboard to the future courses in the series. This course is light on video and instruction and relies more on exercises. This is fine and possibly better since presumably you already understand neural networks well and are just looking to understand how to build GANs. If you do not have a good foundation in deep learning, you should check out Andrew Ng's courses on deep learning first.The exercises can be easier than they should, if you will. Sometimes, the setup of the code that they give you ""for free"" includes critical insights. Make sure to carefully read over and understand the code outside of the few lines that you need to code for each assignment.Also, if you are interested, I encourage you to read some of the works cited, each of which made important contributions.
