Of course coursera gives me a small discount for having already paid it previously. ",0,0,Jorge García,19232793

30769367~COURSE!~TOJsQU6HEeqgBQq3gUc6uQ,1585070787751,4,0,Learning a topic using Hands on project is way better than passive learning in my opinion. Explanation could've been much better. They can use slides and animation to explain the core functioning of objects.,0,0,Utkarsh Raj,30769367
7132371~COURSE!~TOJsQU6HEeqgBQq3gUc6uQ,1584885785327,4,0,"Good course, but still misses a key step: how to save and reuse the modified model without having to rebuild it from scratch? Literature about this topic is at best ambiguous if not flat out lacking. You should include the method for saving and reloading customized models with custom layers and/or standard layers that have been added to the pre-trained models.",0,0,Ali Erdengiz,7132371

61020605~COURSE!~TOJsQU6HEeqgBQq3gUc6uQ,1593605699032,5,0,"A little more in-depth explanation would be better, but if you're approaching this project, chances are you have enough knowledge and momentum to research and learn and figure things out yourself. If you're a hobbyist or need to learn these skills for your job, this is a superb fast-track to getting something that works ready for use. As with Data Science things, for true mastery, more study will be required, but this is a great start. For DL noobs like myself, I recommend reading a few articles on CNN, Image Classification and what Keras is. Perhaps just spend an hour reading whatever you come across (without fussing too much over details) and then dive in. Do not be intimidated by the 'Intermediate' rating of this Guided Project, and then dive right in. It is really quite great and unintimidating.",0,0,Mudit Dalmia,61020605
