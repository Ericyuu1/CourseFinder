I reached out in the ways available to me on the website to help remedy these mistakes, but I was not contacted about them and the mistakes were not fixed. ",0,0,Lauren Mathus,8171911
39821380~COURSE!~SzcJtsvZEeiHLQovJT0emA,1564264597062,5,0,"This second course in the Computational Thinking Specialization was every bit as good as the first.  It provided solid opportunities to learn about and work with the titular concepts but more importantly, it arms teachers with spectacular activities to use as well as potential student pitfalls.  In short, a lot of excellent, potent information presented in a fun and pleasing package.",0,0,Margaret Macalister,39821380
