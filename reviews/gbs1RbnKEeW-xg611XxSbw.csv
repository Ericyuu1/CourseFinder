1552191~COURSE!~gbs1RbnKEeW-xg611XxSbw,1501947218356,1,0,"I did not enjoy this course for the following reasons:1.In the course presentation it is not specified which are the prerequisites for the learners. In this case it seems to me that the potential learner or student has got to have a good knowledge of modern astrophysics, if he or she wants to fully understand the matter as it is presented. 2. The videoclips by dr. J. Peacock are certainly clever, but are generally rather obscure and uncomprehensible by those who do not have a good knowledge of modern astrophysics. I must confess that I have understood almost nothing from those lectures, and I would not be able to repeat the arguments, even not in detail, to somebody else who does not know the subject.3. The course slides are oftenj obscure, particularly those of weeks 3 and 4. Week 3 slides from page 13 to 42 inclusive are almost incomprehensible (even when supported by the video lecture), those of week 4 are about 50% unclear. Week 1 and 2 slides are better understandable.4. In the philosophical part, the stress is on Duhem's, Popper's and Kuhn's theories, but for example, the Hume's critic of the cause concept is not even mentioned. 5. In the videos it is not possible to see what dr. J. Peacock writes on the whiteboard (problem of illumination during making of the videos?)6. There is no real forum. The majority of threads are either instructor created, and contain reference for additional readings, or are rather old, dating eight monts or one year ago. So, there is no real feedback and discussions with other peers in the course.7. I found the article, suggested as additional reading, by O. Lahav and M. Massimi, Dark Energy, Paradigm Shift, and the Role of Evidence, as well done and instructive.",0,2,Guido Bertolino,1552191

51528569~COURSE!~gbs1RbnKEeW-xg611XxSbw,1597037739569,2,0,"While I like how the instructors tried to explain different views of the ""origin"" of the universe, they seemed rather to explain 'how things work or evolve in the universe' as it was existing. There were some philosophical mistakes such as "" because we're not in the center of the universe (or solar system), we're not special or privileged"", to give one example. Our location in the universe or how small our planet is has nothing to do with ""our privilege"". One could argue that our sense of ""privilege"" is a metaphysical subject to begin with and therefor science has nothing to do with it. What makes us, as human beings, privileged is the part in us that is transcendent to the physical world - it is that what allows us to study the physical world. If we were to be completely bound by the physical laws, we would not be able to study it.Furthermore, the scientific method unfortunately is bound by certain preferences such as matter, energy, constants and laws - the same things by which the universe is also bound (what makes our universe a universe). Any mathematical calculations require those constants and laws as they exist. Therefore, science cannot exactly explain the origin of such preferences (where they came from) because science requires the existence of these preferences. In addition, multiverse theory does not answer the main questions ""why is there existence instead of nothing?"", ""where did all this come from?"", ""what gave the constants and laws what they are and how they work among all other possibilities?"". One also should ask 'where did all the multiverse come from?' since they'd of a physical matter. In other words, multiverse theory creates more questions that gives answers. In addition, one of the fundamental principles in science is that if there are two explanations for a certain phenomena where one is simpler than the other, the simpler solution is selected. Choosing the multiverse theory (composed of almost infinite defect universes) over a single intelligent Creator is a bizarre move. I believe that this subject is a metaphysical one, unscientific one. I frankly see that many philosophical mistakes were taken from the western world, but no philosophical concepts from the Muslim world, for example, were presented.In addition, theistic western philosophy was not presented well.In the end, I thank every instructor for presenting their ideas and findings.

Judging religion with scientific parameters is simply wrong, as wrong as judging science with religious parameters; the debate between creationism and evolutionary biology is outdated at least in the creationist position; better effort to try to rescue evolutionism, and not the same on creationism. Lastly, reducing religion to ""religious experience"" or ""tradition"" or ""book"" or ""culture"" is as very poor understanding of religion.I am a fervent and sufficiently knowledgeable catholic, but as an engineer with studies in astrophysics, I'm really open to good arguments. I would recommend one reading and one source, as a way to update some of the arguments: the reading is Fides et ratio, from John Paul II, and the source is disf.org (italian) or inters.org (english), which is a set of articles made by proffesional scholars, on interdisciplinary matters of science and faith.Thanks a lot for an otherwise very enjoyable class!",0,3,Gonzalo Vera,1633619

It has been my first online course experience and I am leaving with a positive impression. Although I appreciate the quality and the amount of information included in these lessons, I have found that some of the content was detached. I have been taking notes in a notebook during the lessons, at times the lecture slides were sufficient and concise, at other times, they were difficult to follow and navigate. The tests have helped me see what's really important, and allowed me to complete my notes with clear definitions. The summary parts at the end of some slide notes were helpful, but sometimes there weren't any. As a philosophy BA and MA graduate, I thought the physics parts were difficult to understand, I couldn't make sense of the formulae, but I think I could follow the lectures with the additional explanations. I also found the references to Stanford Encyc. too obvious, but I have found a rich variety of reading options and videos thanks to you, which will surely expand my knowledge if I continue reading on the subject. Before the lecture, I had already taken philosophy of science classes, so I was familiar with Kuhn, Popper, the history of cosmology, and the main physics theories.

42349266~COURSE!~gbs1RbnKEeW-xg611XxSbw,1563730743225,5,0,"Question Your Assumptions
Science is a process, conducted by human beings over many years, decades and centuries. Scientists are influenced by who they are, where they were educated, who influenced them, what they believe, and the assumptions they hold. Yesterdays ‚Äúscience‚Äù can sometimes be tomorrows ‚Äúgarbage‚Äù. There is a long list of these, dead and abandoned ideas in all scientific professions and fields. This course has demonstrated that scientists are often wrong and for many reasons. This is a good thing because science is self-correcting, and therefore we do not worship science or scientists as it is not a religion, with ‚Äúgods‚Äù. Our concept of the universe, and the ‚Äúcreation‚Äù of the universe has changed over many millennia. This is all to the good. It is important to be skeptical, and use critical thinking and logic. Some of the most brilliant scientists, i.e., Einstein, can be wrong or partially wrong. We live in an exciting time, when everything is being questioned (although creating some stress and anxiety): the ‚Äúbig bang‚Äù, the cosmological constant, the multiverse, string theory, and many other concepts. This course has made this very clear. It even has implications for religious belief, i.e., concepts as: the ‚Äúbeginning‚Äù, ‚Äúcreation‚Äù, the concept of ‚Äúnothing‚Äù, quantum mechanics, the concept of cause and effect and others. The presenters did an excellent job in presenting these many controversies, without bias. The presenters also presented good example between theory and experimental evidence. There is bow a controversy that much of astronomy and cosmology is being unduly influenced by mathematics rather than experimental evidence. However, string theory for example is difficult to demonstrate experimentally. Finally, one must always question one‚Äôs beliefs and assumption, even thought that can be emotionally and psychologically difficult (i.e., Einstein and Bohr), but that is science, a process not a religion. Therefore, I am also taking the other course, on the philosophy of science: cognition.  William B. Secor ",0,1,William B. Secor,42349266
