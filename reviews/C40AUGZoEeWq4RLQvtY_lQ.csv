9220920~COURSE!~C40AUGZoEeWq4RLQvtY_lQ,1495007556805,4,0,"This course lies in the confluence of both my professional experience (software development in the IT industry) and the science that interests me the most: astronomy and astrophysics. Just a glance at the syllabus was enough to convince me that the course would be worth taking, due to its good structure and wide scope, covering current trends in both data science and computational astronomy.From previous online course experience in these areas, I knew at the beginning that contents can be hard to grasp if the theory and practice are not well balanced, but it turned out to be a great run, with enough depth to pique one's interest while at the same time feeling comfortable using both past and newly acquired knowledge.The course sports an excellent tool to solve and test the programming assignments that constitute most of the grades you will earn. Thanks to it, you will be freed, as a student, from the most common hassles in online courses involving coding (mainly environment setup). Which means more chances to focus on the main subjects covered and a pleasant wading through the challenges posed.Beware that if you are already comfortable ín the programming language used (Python), you may easily be craving for more advanced assignments, but this I'm sure is easy to request from the helpful professors and staff. If you are instead a novice with regards to coding, additional parallel effort may be required, but the course contents will guide you well in the endeavor.One aspect of the course that may be specially challenging is the relatively speedy run through the theory and concepts of Machine Learning. A myriad other online courses on the subject exist already; the course focusses instead more on the application of the techniques and nicely shows real world (or more appropriately, universe :-) ) applications which will help cementing the theories behind. I would expect that if you have not had previous contact with the subject, the contents can feel a bit daunting. But with some extra commitment (check the numerous online resources, take a parallel course...) I am pretty sure this can be overcome.",0,0,Victor Martin,9220920

To my surprise, instead of either a 'test card' or 'RF noise', there was a lecture being given by a professor, visiting from the UK, as part of the 'Sydney Summer School of Science'. Wow! Here was exciting and informative educational television on an Australian commercial TV channel, showing at the same time every day for over a week but with no publicity. My awareness of big questions in physics took a great leap forward - by accident.Fast forward 65 years.

My hat is off to the instructors who designed and participated in this course as well as the mentors who were deep in the weeds with us on our code.  With a great deal of effort on your part  you will learn a lot.The single largest issue in data driven astronomy is managing and analyzing enormous datasets.  From the very beginning, you will learn about scaling algorithms up to process the size of the datasets efficiently.  This is a major theme in computer science.You will learn a great deal of astronomy from exoplanets to galaxy morphology.  The material is sophisticated and does not patronize you the student.  It is difficult and rewarding!My knowledge of Python is rusty as I have been focusing on R for the past year.  You will learn more Python, NumPY, matplotlib, and Astropy modules.  The lectures are well thought out and deep.  The instructors made interesting comments about the nature of science and the challenges of astronomy.  The bonus interviews with astronomers are not to be missed.  The astronomers involved drop great tips about  science, the field as it is as well as its recent history.Answers to the quizzes are not entirely contained in the videos.  As a consequence I've either had to think hard about the answers or research the material further--both activities are worthwhile.  Datasets are provided to further pursue the topics in the course, something I fully intend to do.  The k-d algorithm is passed off to a AstroPy module--I think it could be done from scratch.'Careful attention is given to the details of the statistical issues--training and test datasets, asymptotic theory of binning data to obtain medians, etc.  Its all good!If I had any suggestions to make, it would be to encourage writing up the results of the analyses--giving the student the opportunity not just to celebrate successful code, but to understand the results as well.",0,4,Robert Goldberg-Alberts,4641434

This course had everything to satisfy my needs: *I had an opportunity to analyse actual astronomical data, which made me feel like a small child again*I have learned to program in python for scientific reasons, which I previously only used for the backend purposes. The python skills also helped my in my computer modelling studies at the university.*Also, even though I am working with SQL pretty much every day, this course still managed to teach me some new concepts, and understand joins better. This course, even that it's on the astronomy, managed to explain SQL much better than the conventional lectures.Regarding the lecturers, both lecturers seemed extremely passionate in what they are talking about, and also managed to explain everything in very concise manner.Also, I really enjoyed the quizzes, since they do not directly ask what was mentioned in the video, but the questions are twisted a bit to make you actually think for answer.Finally, this course presents a lot of further research to investigate yourself. This ranges from scientific papers to the links to classify galaxies.Overall, in my opinion, this course was truly amazing and made my weekends (that's when I had some time to do the exercises) worthwhile. Would definitely recommend it to anyone starting their journey in astronomy, astronomical data, python programming. If you are quite familiar with machine learning concepts and python though, this course might be a bit too easy for you.

It is very well structured, with a good progression in the complexity which make it accessible even for people who have quite no skills in Python or SQL, and who are no astronomers (like me). The teachers use a wide range of astronomical subjects to illustrate the different techniques used in data analysis. They propose examples and exercises based on real datasets, which is fabulous for people like me who don't have access to such datasets (or can have access to, but no comprehension of what they show).Teachers are also reactive in the forums, which is much appreciated. And, for a non-english speaking person, the subtitles are very usefull. The Grok interface is incredibly easy to use, with, again, a progressive complexity in the exercises, and great explanations at each step.If I tried to find something to improve, I would say: make more obvious how the learned techniques can actually help and improve astrophysical research, maybe with more examples of publications or concrete results obtained in the research field.
