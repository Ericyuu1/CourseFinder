30144610~COURSE!~hb2kM-SqEeavJhLJu8-cXg,1547225140130,3,0,Interesting course with plenty of room for improvement:1) The presentation of the course material is nice2) There are plenty of typos in the quizzes (check forum for pointers)3) There are some false positive answers in the quizzes (check forum for pointers) 4) There is no help offered by the course providers. No help available in the forum.5) It would help to have the step by step answers to the quizzes available to facilitate learning from mistakes.,0,4,Clemens Rumpf,30144610

64543579~COURSE!~hb2kM-SqEeavJhLJu8-cXg,1595964185218,4,0,"Extremely interesting class. Yet, compared to the previous, a bit more ""numerical"" exercices, with simulation and programs to do, in order to test the solutions and know we have programmed the right things, would make it earn this fifth star! Thanks Prof Schaub!",0,0,Samy EL HADDAD,64543579
34107943~COURSE!~hb2kM-SqEeavJhLJu8-cXg,1591421558937,4,0,"Definitely challenging, and a lot to learn. I recommend that on top of taking this course, the content would be a lot more appreciable if you get Professor Schaub's textbook on Analytical Mechanics of Space Systems - as both video and book contents complement each other fairly well to give one an overall understanding of attitude dynamics. Overall, good experience. My only criticism is the absence of any course instructors (it is really purely a self-study thing).",0,0,Samuel Low,34107943
7592634~COURSE!~hb2kM-SqEeavJhLJu8-cXg,1590762784446,4,0,Is a great course. I learned a lot. The instructor is very didactic and very good professor. The course is not that easy to follow if you don't have a good background in physics and mathematics. It would be good to have some optional references to achieve this basic knowledge. I recommend this course a lot.,0,0,Bruno Geninatti,7592634
49710701~COURSE!~hb2kM-SqEeavJhLJu8-cXg,1586266530888,4,0,"It has given me the knowledge I needed to understand major topics of attitude determination. Prof. Schaub is simply superb! He teaches with such a level of passion and masters the stuff so much that you will inevitably turn out caught.I've missed however some more numerical examples in the concept's checks as well as some simulation exercises that did exist in the Kinematics course. Moreover it has been argued that there are quite a few typos in the answers, and I can also confirm this.In general I miss some guidance or extra assistance for your homework.Anyway, I have enjoyed the course hugely.I'll go for the Control one now!",0,1,Jose Felipe Gonzalez,49710701
42534898~COURSE!~hb2kM-SqEeavJhLJu8-cXg,1574442761954,4,0,"Another solid course. My biggest issue with this round in the specialization is the lack of simulation assignments. There was a good deal of derivation/analytical work, but very little numerical implementation of results such as in the Kinematics course in this series.",0,0,Justin Yorick,42534898
148449~COURSE!~hb2kM-SqEeavJhLJu8-cXg,1519895590306,4,0,"Course is very good and well explained, the main problem is the lack of assistence especially when doing exercise and the final exam. In particular, only few people are doing the course and the forum is always w/o any reply, and when doing the final exam, I had to change session three times because not enough people were correctint my assignment, causing me a delay of 2 months.",0,0,Andrea Modenini,148449
