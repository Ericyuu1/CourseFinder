26938749~COURSE!~bfPRWmaJEeuxXgqV68ldrQ,1624480277862,1,0,"The tutor does not explain the decisions taken very often and  overlooks important concepts. This guided project does not teach anything new, apart from what can be seen in free platforms like kaggle or youtube. This guided project would be way better if there were exercises in between the videos to test the learnt content and a final project in a new dataset and not just repeat what the tutor says to the letter.",0,1,Erick Santiago Giraldo Perez,26938749

It was extremely short for a $10 project and there was too little explanation on any concept or method. 
Kaggle, Youtube and many data science-related websites have much better projects with much better guidance than this. 
I wouldn't advice anyone to pay a penny for this project. This was the first, and probably the last, Coursera project that I have paid for. 
If the other projects are like this, then I would say the projects are just a scam if you have to pay any money at all. 
Courses here in Coursera have much better exercises and instructions.",0,1,Ennis Kurt,24541888
