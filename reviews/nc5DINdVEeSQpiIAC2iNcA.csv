It has nothing at all to do with VLSI and none of the tools you get access to will be practical for you to use for large exampls.  If you seek to understand how digital circuits get synthesized, how the functional descriptions are broken down into elements and then reconstructed as gates and circuit elements, this has some of the basics.  The tools you get access to are old, with primitive user interfaces, suitable only for very simple examples.  This is ok for the purpose of understanding the basics if you are interested in the internals of such tools.  The course will not help you with modern VLSI design with modern EDA tools, if that is what you are looking for.
