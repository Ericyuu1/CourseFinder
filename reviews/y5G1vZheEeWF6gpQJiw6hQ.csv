It is a fascinating subject, that's why I listened, however,

The young lady giving the lectures to be polite should have a desk job. Very poor public speaker with nervous hand gestures, monotone delivery,hard swallowing. What is an interesting subject matter becomes insufferable. That said, perhaps the use of charts listing types, locations and ancestry, specific features, etc. would help keep track of a vast subject matter, alas, now more of a jumble  than I had anticipated. Also, please eliminate a good many of the intra-lecture pop quizzes, unless your target audience is 8th and 9th graders. Unnecessarily simplistic, bordering on insulting. The week end tests are well thought out, thought provoking. ",0,0,Brent Lebl,44354895

I would have given it 5 stars if it weren’t for the misuse of the term ‘meteorite’. Meteorite was used interchangeably with meteor when they are not the same. Meteorites are space rocks that have landed on the surface of the earth and meteors are still in space. In addition, the object that impacted the earth at the end of the Cretaceous was surely large enough to qualify as an asteroid. This may seem like a trivial detail to those who specialize in the study of dinosaurs, but it is important to be consistent and show understanding of subjects outside of your expertise.

Not only did it cover a lot of ground in the core subject (dinosaur diversity, lifestyles, phylogeny, and extinction), but it also went over evolution, finding fossils, and taphonomy and preservation in a succinct manner. It also dispelled some common myths and possible misconceptions about dinosaurs. The most I would do with it is perhaps update it a bit, as I have seen some information that seems to be more outdated. For example, I remember drawings for Spinosaurus are still long-legged (it has since been found to have short legs and a paddle-like tail).

The lecture handouts really need to be proof-read to eliminate typos, grammatical errors, inconsistent use of American and British English, inconsistent information, and inaccurate information (predentary bone in upper jaw...).  There are also instances where something could be better explained/integrated with the course, for example in Lesson 3 when Betsy says: ""this is a cross-section of a hadrosaur jaw"" but doesn't point out any features on it so it is not at all informative.The functionality of the course on Chrome is very problematic.  For the questions asked during the lecture videos, the answer window pops up at most 1 second after the question diagram is finished being drawn.  Sometimes this means you have about 0.5 second to memorize the diagram as the answer choices are simply letters (A, B, etc.).  Other times, the answers and their corresponding buttons to click are separated vertically by a lot of space.  The fossil viewer does not work at all in Chrome which is a real disappointment.  Assuming the ""F15"" in the lecture handout filenames indicates that they were created in fall of 2015, and many other students have pointed out the above issues, I find it difficult to believe that previous students have not pointed out the same issues.  I am not sure if there is any ""upkeep"" being done to this course since its creation.  I would have given the course five stars if these issues had been corrected.    ",0,0,Arminty Clarke,85788295

This course has the pontential to be expanded and elaborated by adding lessons with more profound survey of all the dinosaurs groups, their anatomical features and their ecology niche (e.g. considering 15-mins video of each major clade, such as theropods, coelosaurs, sauropodomorph, ornithopods, thyreophorans and marginocephalians).

This course both answered and created wonder about the dinosaurs - the conditions under which they dominated the Earth, what fossils tell us about their physiology (they had melanosomes, for colour!), and how we've used that information to classify them, and so much more. I loved that each video was peppered with little quiz exercises to get you thinking and reviewing. And then, the 5-question tests after each week were alternately straightforward AND challenging. Fun! The presenters were all very good - thank you Dr. Currie and Betsy. My only suggestion would be to provide a captioned illustration of every species mentioned in the videos. The visual to attach the species name to. Time to time, I would google a pic, for my own interest. I absolutely loved the geologic time interactive - that was a work of art. I only wish that I could keep playing with it. So nice!Thank you to all the people who worked so hard to share their scientific knowledge with us. It's inspiring.",0,0,Shauna Blair,4335636

As a boy I was enthralled about dinosaurs, spent hours reading over dinosaur books, drawing their skeletons and wanted to be a dinosaur paleontologist when I grew up. I was a massive fan of Jurassic Park and beleived that one day we would be living in some kind of Dinotopia. Well, life turned out very differently however but when seeing this course available, it rekindled that nostalgia and excitement so I signed up. Its been a great course, it taught me things I never knew or simply forgotten. I got through it far quicker than the 12 weeks despite currently studying and working full-time, just because I enjoyed it so much.

The videos and drawings in the course are enjoyable, and make the course much more user-friendly than it would have been otherwise.  If I had one change to make it would be that sometimes when there's a mini-quiz during a video, it would be nice for there to be a slightly longer pause with the drawings before the answer submission page pops up.  This helps a person actually look at the drawings along with the words, while thinking about what the answer would be.  Of course you can just pause the video if needed, and this is what I did after I figured this out.  I don't know if everyone would have appreciated a slightly longer pause as I mentioned, or if that was just me.  Anyways, thank you for offering this online course!  I know way more about dinosaurs, how they evolved and lived than I did before. Oh just one more note about the educational technology - I thought it was cool to look at fossils with the 3-D fossil-viewer that could be manipulated!  I somewhat liked what was done with the geologic time scale in the interactive version, but I was also glad that I had already gone to the earlier link to see the geologic time scale listed in a chart format, as this was easier if you were looking for something in particular or just wanted to read through it, even though the interactive version was more pleasant to sit and have presented to you.

The course leader is great and inspiring and the grad' students who took in charge some of the sessions did a very good job at it.The weak spot of the course are the in-video quizzes. Sometimes the presenter says to check all that apply and it's not possible, sometimes the questions are asked before the topic is covered and we are therefore asked to guess, sometimes the questions admit of several interpretations and even, in some instances, the interpretation given by the instructor doesn't sound right, which suggests that the question was poorly phrased.",0,2,Carlo,5939585

Uptill now I was not especially interested in Dinosaurs, but as amateur Palaeontologist I was looking for a Course Palaeontology that suits my special interest: Pleistocene Mammals.But this Course Dinosaurs Palaeobiology offers so much more than Dinosaurs and many of the toppics are useful for other species too, such as:Death and Fossilisation; Eating; Moving around; Birth, Growth and Reproduction; Attack and Defence; What is a Species; Evolution; Stratigraphy and Geologic Times and Paleogeography and Plate Tectonics. I have studied the Lessons with great pleasure and I learned a lot thanks to the clear explanations of Dr. Philip Currie and Mrs Betsy Kruk. The Course is very well composed with PDF for reading, Video for watching and interactive media for doing exercises. The quiz at the end of each lesson was also good and easy to answer after studying the lesson and handles more about understanding the content than reproduce endless lists of difficult names.Now I am studying the last 2 chapters and I can say that I have learnt a lot, thanks to Dr. Currie and Mrs Kruk and I am looking forward already for other Courses of the University of Alberta.

I am a course designer (the world is full of junk courses, including from Princeton, shudder) and I love, love, love this entire sequence, but especially this course.  The flow is logical, the questions in the video ask you to think but aren't too far (they are scaffolded) away from what we might know or guess, the final questions are fair.  And you don't use 5 new tech terms in the same sentence; you let us absorb the new info at the rate that the human brain can actually learn. I learned a few things just by watching you.  A lot of credit to Dr. Currie for some of this: he uses the terms that need to be used, and plain English for common things like ""river"" (another class' Waterloo).  Bravo to the gents and brava to the wonderful presenter.  I just wish you had the budget for another 15 classes.... sigh.  ",0,1,Victoria C Leo,13752450
