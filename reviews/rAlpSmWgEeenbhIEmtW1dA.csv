The videos are crisp, sure, but it takes several hours of studying from the book (and other sources too!) just to meet the expectations. The videos convey not much, and so, the whole course is about reading the books and trying to get through the quiz.And I don't know about the others, but I found the quiz to be extremely tough (though exhaustive). Not to mention the several prerequisites that need to be met before even starting the course, which saps away bit of motivation. All in all, not a typical Coursera course.
