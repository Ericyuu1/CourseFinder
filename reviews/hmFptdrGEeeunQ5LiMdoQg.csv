However, the assignments are absolutely terrible and there is no support from the course staff in completing and/or understanding what each assignment is asking for. For 3 of the 4 assignments, I spent most of my time simply figuring out how to format the answer rather than implementing the programming. If you ask a question, you can expect to receive not a single answer from any course staff. Overall, the course is not worth the frustration.",0,0,N. Jordan Jameson,1820419
37424669~COURSE!~hmFptdrGEeeunQ5LiMdoQg,1632075328344,1,0,"In the video lectures, the instructor only reads out loud the text on the slides. However, the lectures are not so bad, although more detailed information would be very helpful. The quizzes are very easy (too easy?) and each quiz consists of ~5 questions. The programming assignments are also very, very basic. The actual task is to figure out what should be done and what the correct input format is. I spend >90% of my time reading compaints in the discussion threads hoping for clarification and only <10% of my time coding. Even questions that have been asked 3 months ago remained unanswered by the instructors who seem to be absent from the course. Luckily, some couse participants figured out what the instructors expect as a solution and shared this information.In conclusion, this was the worst coursera course I have ever taken and I strongly suggest coursera to take action (either take this course offline or make sure it is improved).",0,3,Markus Braun,37424669

However, The assignment instructions and the auto-grade system is too weak. It makes you waste too many hours trying to figure out what is wrong with your solution which turns out to be like a blank line at the end or you are even submitting something else. The problem instruction did not specify what they want you to do. So you totally understand the topic and successfully do the assignment in two hours and spend another four trying to submit it to the system to get the grade.

This, together with the very scarce value of the automated grading tool - replies are hardly useable - makes it often impossible to understand the errors and causes a substantial waste of time, not proportionate to the complexity of the assignment itself. Moreover, the lack of replies from supervisors or instructors to the numerous queries posted by students seems to show that this course is running unattended.

However, the instructions in the week 4 assignments aren't really clear about what is expected in order for a learner to pass. The instructions for the Strong Scaling Study and the Weak Scaling Study should be: enter three lines in your submission file that represent what flags and parameters you would write after ""mpiexec -np N ./scale.out"" to complete the command for N=1,2,4. Basically, what X, Y and T should be used for N=1,2,4 depending on which scaling study you're conducting. Make sure that you press enter after the third line so that the total number of lines in the submission file is 4. I​f the course facilitators could update the instructions for the Strong Scaing Study and the Weak Scaling Study to be more clear about what is expected, learners would like this course more and rate it higher. As it is right now, the instructions imply that you are to run the commands and submit the result to the grader, when in actuality, you are expected to enter the parameter part of the commands for each case of N=1,2,4 to pass the assignment.",0,2,Wesley Farmer,25485001

The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because some of the assignment prompts are ambiguous and the autograder does not provide any helpful feedback on what you missed.
