I got responses for my peers that they reviewed/graded my assignment so why can't I see my grade and why is my course still pending completion? I need to get my certificate tonight because my payment cycle renews tomorrow, I do not wish to pay a whole month's fee just because the system is not registering my grade although I have done my part on time. Kindly help me out Marium Manji",0,1,Marium Manji,41794834

66454771~COURSE!~V_MwPXxREeeo9AoHTbC3Wg,1609168367478,4,0,"Course content was appropriate for a final course.  Unfortunately, feedback for the practice assignments, which would have been helpful, was never received.  Also, when I tried to review practice assignment submissions most of them did not have any files attached to them, or attached files were not what the assignment asked for.  It appeared that people were just submitting so that they can view the rubric.  It was frustrating that I failed to meet the deadline for the Peer Graded Assignment not because I failed to submit my work but because there were no submissions to review.  BTW, for the last part of the Graded Assignment on 4E-s table and narrative, there was no provision to upload a file.  Was this done on purpose?  Discussion Forums for this particular course proved to be useless - no learning at all. Posts focused on appeals to rate submissions for the practice assignments.  Maybe just provide a separate forum for the appeals.  But, don't get me wrong - I found all the courses in this specialization very helpful.  More engaging and easier to navigate than the course they have in IHI. Thank you!",0,1,Teresita Castillo,66454771
55869067~COURSE!~V_MwPXxREeeo9AoHTbC3Wg,1602750425608,4,0,The course is overall very helpful. But plagiarism is very prevalent. One person named B M Taufiq Imon has completely uploaded my assignments in his name. I flagged him once but again I got his assignment for reviewing. Such kind of acts cannot be promoted because it is some one else's hard work and one cannot upload just like that. The rules for plagiarism should be strict and removed from the course with immediate effect.,0,0,Mekha Elizabath Raji ,55869067

3928621~COURSE!~V_MwPXxREeeo9AoHTbC3Wg,1538470316101,4,0,"I hope the teachers get to review our work and give feedback also.  I hope we have a real time knowledge of how we are fairing in our submission.  Until when should we wait to know whether we passed the assignment or not, or that we need to revise it if we don't get enough feedback.  How many times do we reset deadlines considering we are paying a monthly fee!   Sorry, I initially gave a good review, but waiting for feedback is kinda frustrating.  Maybe the teachers can help too.  Hope you understand.  Thank you!  Overall, still a good course!This was my initial review:The module entailed a lot of work but I think it's worth it since can be used in actual practice.  Thank you to the teachers.",0,1,Maria Concepcion Sison,3928621
