61564701~COURSE!~yKb2o0ehEeWk9g4dP2hYVQ,1595645037538,3,0,"I want to thank you for the lessons learned in the People Analytics course, all learning will always be about growth and development.The different approaches given in the course, allow us to explore fields and applications in Human Resources management, which is very much needed in the vast majority of organizations and in Human Resources departments as managers of this field.I want to give you feedback on the opportunities presented in the course from the perspective of Business Analytics as a package of the 4 courses included:1. There is no uniformity in the structure of the 4 courses, i.e. the training model is not systematic. There is no uniformity in the structure of the four courses, that is, the training model is not systematic. It seems that each course is independent of the other, and even if it is, it does not maintain a uniformity in what is offered as a model of key analytics: 1.2. It seems that the same mistake is made that the same material in People Analytics points out, that is, while in the operational areas of the business, financial and commercial, the Business Analytics course works with numbers, excel sheets, calculations, and ""dragging the pencil"" in the People Analytics course is left to verbal word management, this is a great weakness in organizations, and it is evident in the development model of this part of the analytics course: presentation, slides, verbalized examples, and additional literature, but even in the case of the Collaboration Networks theme, we do not work hand in hand with the participant in developing a network on paper, let alone arrive at calculations of density, centricity, etc3. There is a great opportunity to raise the standard of this module of People Analytics, when there is already updated literature as THE POWER OF PEOPLE from Harvard, or The Financial Analytics for HR Managers, where you can apply the tools that you offer for example in Operation Analytics, as the SOLVER model to optimize objectives, take them to projects of personnel management to optimize processes. In this sense I feel a bit disappointed as a ""customer"" of the Business Analytics course, where some key concepts that they expose, are not taken to themselves in the course model itself.This is something that the managers of the University of Pennsylvania should review, and work more with the user approach as a purchasing experience.It leads me to think that both they are using this same information and what is reviewed in the forums, as to be direct and immediate input to make adjustments to their training processes, which coupled with the online system there is no replication to interact in a timely manner with teachers and management.I mention this not in order to make a claim, but rather as a measure of congruence with the value and scope of the topic.One thing I have learned with you, is that everything must lead us to maximize the result to the expected goal, in the midst of restrictions and with a leverage strategy. This takes me beyond asking myself, but rather raising, that this same scope of optimization models is not being carried out in the course methodology. Still, I am grateful for the contribution they have made in the People Analytics course, to the extent that it has been given.Thank you very much.JOEL ESTRADA ESTRADATranslated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)",0,0,Joel Estrada Estrada,61564701

Years ago I wrote a paper suggesting a formal requirement for a ""Human Capital Balance Sheet"" be established alongside the traditional financial balance sheet and income statement.  It's interesting that in electronics we perform ""circuit analysis"" as a design parameter to manage load and efficiency parameters but for years in management we did not see the value of a similar analysis of communication and loading in ""human circuits."" Organizational Network Analysis corrects a blindness suffered and overlooked in the review process for the past century.  Now with technology, we are able to harness data to correct this blindness, as if Peter Drucker and Edwards Demming met for the first time and co-invented processes to advance the data of human capital management.  Data allows the blending of X and Y theory by nullifying much bias and fallacy which survived on pre-ONA blindness.  This course revealed so much insight into the value added by new methods based on legitimate, describable statistical and mapping visuals not economically available until now.  I could see ONA used BEFORE selecting a new ERP system or required for companies undergoing rapid growth...and so on.

For example, in Government companies, where ownership is intangible and the management has a free hand to conduct the affairs in return for a trade off with corrupt Government officials. Not only do they get a free hand to get away without maximizing stakeholders' value, they also retain powers to chalk out a succession plan, which will help perpetuate the system. If you do a study, you will find that that the lower and mid levels of management are better educated and more talented than the top rung, because this system is crucial to maintaining the organizational mediocrity, which helps a few influential people.
