502389~COURSE!~Uw_dZt1UEeiKDQqUtLvFaA,1587404678621,1,0,"In itself, a good course. If you want to take this course, I recommend it. If you are, however, taking this entire  specialization I suggest you walk away. The final course (course 5) is a  course by someone who has not been lecturing in the course, presenting  something they obviously are very fond of. The course work is, and I  quote, ""a project with minimal scaffolding. Expect to use the the  discussion forums to gain insights! It’s not cheating to ask others for  opinions or perspectives"". In other words, part of the learning target  is to work through bad or incomplete documentation and to solve an  exercise that is stated without providing the information you need to  solve it. Unless someone else already went through the moves, the  lecturer fully expects you to fail by yourself. If I wanted to feel the pain of learning without help or instructions, I would have just worked with the online manuals ... which is what this exercise openly tells you they want you to do. Its a shame for the other 4 courses, which are well done and have passionate lecturers.",0,3,Hanno Hildmann,502389

There are false statement in what is said (e.g. about some Windows operating system long ago not supporting long file names - Windows 3.1 wasn't an OS, and Windows 95 already supported them). There are obvious lapsus linguae in what is said. There are arrogant mistakes in TESTS! E.g.: it asks ""sort-5-1: What will the sorted function sort by?and says: ""first country name (alphabetically), then temperature (lowest to highest)"" but in the task script are ""Reykjavik, Buenos Aires, Cairo, Berlin and Caloocan ""Since when Reykjavik, Buenos Aires, Cairo, Berlin and Caloocan are countries?!?And it gets even more interesting in the next question! I.e. ""sort-5-2: What how will the following data be sorted?"" and among options:A. first country name (reverse alphabetically), then temperature (lowest to highest) C. first country name (reverse alphabetically), then temperature (lowest to highest) The answers A and C are exactly the same. BUT! - The ""A"" is correct, while ""C"" is not!And the microphone used within the specialization is very sensitive - so you hear them swallow every time.

Course 5 (the capstone project) was an abomination. Basically zero instruction / guidance and very frustrating for anybody except decently experienced programmers. If courses 1-4 are your only exposure to Python, you could easily spend a month or more on this project. If getting the Specialization Certificate is very important to you, there are resources online that you can leverage to complete the project but that is done largely at the expense of any real learning, so I really hope UofM comes up with an alternative final project that is more consistent with the level of expertise attained in courses 1-5 (maybe something on implementing classic algorithms?).
