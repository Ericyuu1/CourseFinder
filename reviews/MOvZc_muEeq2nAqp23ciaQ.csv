87331997~COURSE!~MOvZc_muEeq2nAqp23ciaQ,1640775479766,1,0,"T​his course is harmful to beginners as they are mislead what accessibility testing entails and useless to intermediate lerners, as it does not really teach anything about 508 complience. A short lecture on what the law says is nice, but the focus is on a single (and not very good) extention to see what colour blindness looks like.T​his course should be deleted of the system.",0,0,Philipp Christoph Tautz,87331997
19232793~COURSE!~MOvZc_muEeq2nAqp23ciaQ,1614315262992,4,0,"I do not recommend taking this type of course, take one and pass it, however after a few days I have tried to review the material, and my surprise is that it asks me to pay again to be able to review the material. Of course coursera gives me a small discount for having already paid it previously.
It is very easy to download the videos and difficult to get hold of the material, but with ingenuity it is possible. Then I recommend uploading them to YouTube and keeping them private for when they want to consult (they avoid legal problems and can share with friends), then they can request a refund.
