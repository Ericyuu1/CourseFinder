48630568~COURSE!~OFt7o_8IEee1YxLCJ0cSDA,1598019569876,1,0," [Reviewing the entire specialization but points are applicable for
each course]I signed up for the
IBM Data Science specialization and I was genuinely excited to start
it for some 4-5 weeks (I had a GCP exam coming up). I eventually
started the specialization beginning of August `20 and started making
my way though it and I was amazed … amazed of how much a pile of
bullshit this specialization is. I made it though the first 4 courses
and at the end of the SQL for data science I couldn’t take it
anymore. Here’s why:1. First and
foremost, the entire specialization (all 4 courses I have taken at
least) were full of typos and broken URLs which a lot of other
students confirm as well. This does not speak professionalism to me
but whatever, lets move on.2. The in-video
quizzes and following tests are simply ridiculous … you are
expected to have memorized content word by word rather than
understand thing for your own and be able to explain them. Some of
the question were so far away from tech courses it is not even funny.3. The final
assignments are a total joke. We are asked to review each other which
IMHO is a terrible idea since we are all just starting up. Nothing
stops you from giving top marks to a bad assignments and vice versa.4. We eventually got
to the more techy part and even got code snippets and jupyter
notebooks to look through but they were still bad. There was no
proper order in which information was presented i.e. you would read
python and seaborn code in the SQL course’s tasks even though
python and matplotlib/seaborn are discussed in the following courses.5. And my final and
biggest problem with this whole specialization is that it all feel
like an extended advertisement of this piece-of-dodo tech inbred
excuse-of-a-software called IBM cloud. There are constants up-sells
here and there how almighty IBM is and how great their cloud and IBM
Watson Studio are … they are not. I had to spend 2+ hours fixing
problems with jupyter notebooks and their cloud just to complete my
assignments which both took me 30ish minutes. They mention open
source and even though there are open source equivalents to jupyter
they insist using IBM cloud. I kept having the feeling they are more
focused on promoting IBM products than actually bringing quality
content.6. Now after
finishing the SQL course there was a 1min survey which I gladly
filled in basically letting them know their specialization if
terrible and is doing more harm than good in my opinion. I even sent
them a quick challenge because I do not think IBM maintains this
course at all or even reads the reviews. You can see my challenge to
IBM here: https://bit.ly/3geOyfbI was very saddened
by the quality of the specialization and the content and was
wondering whether I should even try and finish the remaining courses
but after reading some reviews on the remaining courses I figured out
it was just more of the same. If you are in the same boat I would
recommend the kaggle micro-courses which I will focus on starting
next week.In conclusion, I got
this whole specialization for free via financial aid and I have to
say even though I did not pay a dime I feel I need to be compensated
by IBM and refunded real money for torturing myself with their
courses.  ",0,1,Georgi Kolev,48630568

They need to be supported by better examples which do not include a lot of terminology specific to the topic. 2) The questions in the videos can be better designed to evaluate the students' knowledge about the topic, e.g., letting them apply their knowledge in new examples. Some questions are redundant such as the name of the person who designed the data science methodology or  questions specific to the case study and does not necessarily provide insight into general concepts.3) Simply reading what is in the slides is not a good use of videos and cannot keep the focus of the students for a long time.4) This course might be located after the Python for Data Science course or even later so that the students could have a more meaningful final assignment, actually applying what they learned on a small data set.5) Knowing a subject and teaching a subject are two different things.

It’s like ordering a meal at a famous, beautiful, expensive restaurant. The customer orders the food and then they get what they ordered. However, they didn’t see and hear Gordon Ramsey in the kitchen and the fight it took to bring the best dish to you. When we as students come to the course, everything is already prepared. We don’t see the hours of hard work and extreme attention to details that go into it. So thank you all for what you do behind the scenes. I’ve learned a lot so far and I really can’t wait to keep going. In this course I really like the simple approach it took in the beginning and the illustrations and comparisons to cooking. It made it really easy because who can’t identify with wanting to have a good meal? Hopefully I can add a small touch about what I’ve observed to the vast knowledge of IBM. In the course, it was explained well what the data methodology is and then how that knowledge was applied in the case study. However, it was difficult to understand why that knowledge was applied the way it was. It felt like a math equation was shown on the board and then right after that, the answer was shown, but what was missing was the steps in between of why that was the answer. Another part that made it difficult to fully comprehend was the labs. I was looking forward to actually working with data, but everything was already there and it felt like the answers were shown to me without helping me understand why this conclusion had been reached. It’s easy to pick out things to work on because nobody is 100% free from flaws and really who am I to attempt to suggest anything to an industry that doesn’t need my viewpoint? I do hope that this was received well. This course still was a very hearty meal and left me wanting more. I look forward to the next course!

Unlike hand-on courses, which present tools, methodologies and technics, this one gives a solid overview of Data Science problematic areas and describes successful real-life Data Science project. Let's say, tools, technics, algorithms are related to tactics, while this course presents strategy. Both are equally important for problem solving.Excellent tactics without strategy becomes a waste of electricity, disk space, time and money with only partially useful results. In fact, one may create a good classification models just to qualitatively prove known things, but these very good and precise numbers won't help you to resolve business question being asked. Excellent strategy without tactics is even worse - one may know where to move, one may know how to move, but is not able to perform even a single practical step, because execution is compromised.",0,0,Volodymyr Myrgorodskyi,49345812
