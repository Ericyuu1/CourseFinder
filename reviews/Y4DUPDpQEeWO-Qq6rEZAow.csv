Now, I understand the difficulty some people might have met in the previous two courses and left mixed reviews.I do not even know where to start with how bad this course was. There has been incomplete information in the online course that you could find in the textbook. But, some written scripts/programs in the textbook are different/changed from the ones in the video. Moreover, the assignments' descriptions are so hard to understand that when we had to use BeautifulSoup to follow links it took me 1 hour to understand what I was asked to do. I am not a native English speaker and I could have worded it better.Then there are other issues such as:- explanations of installing BeatifulSoup, and where, unclear- accessing Google API does not work anymore; how am I supposed to follow along with the example given for how to work with APIs?- Twitter has changed the way you can access their API and now requires  3 tokens, not 4 as in the videos/textbook; I guess I have to look this one up on the internet too, so I can properly grasp the concept-  there is missing information in the course/textbook on how to approach the assignments.I do not mind doing research on my own, but how am I supposed to know what to look for if I am not told what I need to finish the assignments? The other issue, and the reason I signed up to Coursera, is that infomation you find online is overwhelming and it seems no one wants to make programming easy for someone that has no clue how to start. I would expect this not to be an issue when using Coursera.

Basically if your coding does not meet their answer, they just make the judgement that you are CHEATING and COPYING while unable to figure out which part is a violation. Frustrating and not understandable at all.
2. Tamara Brunnock is not a good fit for this TA position, suggested from a student perspective. when my homework is flagged by violation, he is totally rude, doing nothing helpful but keeps denouncing my inappropriate cheating behaviours. Literally ruined my experience. I’ve reviewed Tamara’s comments on others, how come that a TA describes someone’s homework as a JOKE while they just made a simple mistake of uploading wrong images? The rudeness and ignorance are totally unacceptable. Get someone qualified with basic manners to assist with the course please!3. Content: not going into depth and lack of clear explanation of key definition and use of specific codes. Instead of teaching you how to write code, they teach you how to copy and paste. Like what have been said, seems the lecturer has something more important to do so he needs to rush over it.

2005353~COURSE!~Y4DUPDpQEeWO-Qq6rEZAow,1590470504272,1,0,"This course does introduce the beginning student to the web access aspects  albeit in a rudimentary manner. This could have been a very informative and educational course but it was tarnished because of several shortcomings and errors.   Pros ------ If you have not done any form of web-based programming or not familiar with that technology, this course does introduce a beginning programming student on the rudimentary aspects of accessing web data using Python. You will learn techniques such as creating sockets, connecting to a host and retrieving web pages as well as related third-party products that help you understand what's going on behind the scenes  Cons ------ 1. The course presents complex code with no comments and no explanation of the more complex functions. You come away with a empty feeling of not having understood everything that you have learned. And that includes the assignments which use code provided by the instructor  2. The topics regarding XML and Json structures and access methodologies could have been explained in more detail. Chuck went over his code without explaining some of the key points which I had to discover on my own. Extremely challenging for newbies  3. I felt the assignments were confusing and not very challenging. I realize this is a beginner's course and therefore the level has to be kept down but I felt that a couple more (optional if necessary) assignments for some of us who want to delve deeper into this area would have been more educational  4. As far as some of the technology described in the course and the sample code provided for web scraping twitter info, what can I say....except that it was DISASTROUS! Chuck talks about using telnet to access web servers. But most of the students did not understand the concepts as was evident from the innumerable questions for help. It seemed like the teaching staff themselves were ill-prepared to answer telnet questions or perhaps thoroughly frustrated as evinced in their curt replies and a burning desire to skip questions related to telnet. This spiraling of telnet-related questions became so heavy that one of the mentors finally put the topic to eternal rest by stating...""I am going to close this thread because telnet has been deprecated since the videos were made and there is no reason wasting time on an obsolete method."" All very well said, but all this frustration and anguish for both students and mentors about such an ""obsolete"" technology could have been squarely avoided had this topic been removed or a warning note placed. Same for the twitter code samples provided in this course, which did not work because of structural and policy changes implemented by twitter. Not the instructor's fault though.  5. Another frustrating experience was the lack of help provided for those who posted questions on the socket programs provided by the instructor. The programs were written for a MacOS environment and the exact same code fails miserably in a Windows environment. Sometimes the students make mistakes in typing the code, sometimes they are behind a firewall/proxy server which results in a run-time error. There have been innumerable posts about the socket errors faced by many students. It would have been helpful for the students to understand what they did wrong.  One mentor, Tamara Brunnock, the teaching staff for this course cleverly sidesteps the original problem by a standardized cookie-cutter response ""Try using Chrome Developer Tools instead"". This exact phrase has been used in at least 30 responses and variations of this phrase in other responses. This tool is in no way related to the original Python program and does not help the student understand what went on in the program or how to understand the error. If a teaching staff member can respond to a legitimate student complaint on a programming problem by directing them to a third-party tool instead of addressing the original problem, it does not speak well of this course. I would have given this course a higher rating but after all the frustrations I encountered, the lack of adequate help from the staff and a lack of explanation of concepts used in the lectures have left me unsatisfied and unhappy with having spent big bucks on this course. This course needs a lot of upgrading to newer technologies and dissolution of obsolete technologies and non-functional code that is provided.  By all means take this course but be prepared for a frustrated, time-consuming experience.   ",0,9,Rameses,2005353

A student is bombarded with information about regular expressions, the HTTP protocol, web sockets, URLs, HTML, XML, JSON, and APIs. In fact, the video lectures spend the majority of the time explaining these concepts, while spending very little time explaining how to use Python to access web data. The corresponding book, Python for Informatics, was of little help understanding the assignments. Like the videos, the book lacks sufficient numbers of examples.

It is entirely possible that this course perfectly suits the needs of a person who has taken programming classes before and can fill the gaps, but it was not well suited for someone in my position. Below is my review of course #3 of the Python for Everybody certificate program. Let me start by saying that much like the University of Michigan football team, this course is highly reviewed at the onset, starts off well, and falls apart near the end. The class does a good job of covering basics on a topic, but expects one to bridge the gap between learnings with steps not covered (or barely touched on) in the program. This is likely due to an effort to keep the videos manageable in length, as I have yet to come across one longer than 20 minutes. However, this attempt at brevity causes much to be missed in execution; many students post the same questions to the online forum for help, which leads one to believe that crucial steps were missed or overlooked by the majority of students. I routinely find myself passing the 10-question quiz on the first attempt, but then not understanding what the assignment is asking me to accomplish. This results in me making wild guesses at the code and re-watching hours of content for a throwaway sentence that holds the key to the problem at hand. To summarize, the videos seem to prepare the user for the end-of-chapter quiz, but the assignments are far detached from the learnings of the video and textbook. This course might be well suited for someone who has used Python or other languages in the past and wants to take a course to refine their skills. If you're a professional looking to learn Python for the first time, you're better off buying a book that provides the answer to an exercise with step-by-step rationale for the process (something the author's textbook does not do, unfortunately).

As some other reviewers have already stated I, too, felt increasingly frustrated and somehow left alone during this course. Most of this course's assignments were way too difficult and I had to search the web for hours to find some help to solve them. Or, quite honestly, I had to cheat my way through them, because I just didn't know what to do anymore. There are of course the discussion forums where one can state one's problem - but although the staff and mentors are really quick with replying (thumbs up for that), their tips are often way too general and not helpful at all.

After taking this third course I will definitely not continue with the Specialization, as I originally planned to, simply because in comparison to the first two courses, this third course is way too difficult and frustrating!

Also, in my opinion, Dr Chuck tries to squeeze in far too many different topics and different programming langauges into this course, instead of really just focusing on Python itself.

I completed this course, yes, but it left me with a very frustrated and unsatisfied feeling. I don't think I was really able to learn a lot from it, which is really a pity, since I enjoyed the first two courses so much.

Assignments are more difficult to tackle than in the previous two courses probably because the materials needed to solve them were either not well explained or were explained in later lessons. For example, the instruction for a particular assignment gave a starting sample code that was claimed to be the closest to the code to do the assignment, a statement that turned out to be wrong. It was not close to it at all. This area should be looked into for future learners. The learners' minds should be prepared from the beginning that there might be a need to go outside the course materials to tackle some assignments.  Overall, again, the course is an excellent introduction to what Python can do in search programs using regular expressions and in scraping the web and other applications. To be very good at these topics, like any other courses, learners will need extensive practice on their own, as most of the assignments were completed through a hand-holding technique using the provided sample codes.   Overall, I am happy with what I am learning in python programming, and perhaps, I would use this new knowledge to work as a web developer someday.

Where it falls down is in the JSON section I think.  Although I agree that XML is richer, it is not harder to use: in fact, I think it is easier (but that may be my bias of 25 years' exposure to SGML/XML with a language that processes SGML/XML *brilliantly* but is almost exclusive to publishing (OmniMark).  The JSON nested dictionaries and lists are just plain confusing and hard to read IMHO and if you did not have the sample code it would be very hard to complete the first assignment of Week 6.  The bit that Chuck fails to point out about XML is that it has an inherent bias to handling complex *documents* rather than extracts of repetitive data.  It is impossible to mimic Docbook or any other complex document with JSON, and it was a bit annoying that this key point was omitted (or at least I don't recall it being pointed out - all that was said was JSON is better, easier, preferrable, etc.).

retrieve web pages, how to request a server and get back web data using some python
libraries like urllib(a python library to retrieve web page). Overall, for the assignments
you have to know programming logic a little bit. After retrieve web pages you need to work
with data. So you have to know conditon, loop, list, dict etc. All the assignments of this

Because of that, I'm still not sure whether I have to learn or memorize all of the lines written in a particular file or I'd be well of just by knowing what line of code is doing what and by being able to modify and use them to get the work done.

I didn't know how much I appreciated that slide format until it was gone! I also prefer the long (40min/lecture) format, as opposed to all these short units as separate video things-- it made it much harder to go back and find/rewatch something because I couldnt remember what short segment the topic was covered in, as opposed to just searching a giant transcript. Also (maybe this is just me?) the links to navigate within the course aren't there (just below the floating 'coursera' header), so I had to constantly go to the home page and re-find my place after submitting assignments- extra aggravating with the increased number of shorter videos.

This is the third of 5 courses in Python 2.7, so the full 5 courses are 
excellent for a Beginner to become a solid Intermediate, this Web Access
 course alone should only be taken by those with some Python programming
 experience (like the prior 2 beginning courses on programming and data 
structures in Python).

I did the course using Python 3.5, from Anaconda, after starting the 
more challenging MIT 6.00 courses (2 of them), which use 3.5 but are 
faster paced yet with more challenging problems. [Some issues switching 
from 2.7 to 3.5 -- there now is a revised Open Source book using py3x]

Dr. Chuck's course offers true high quality learning but allowing me to 
work my 40 hrs /week and do the course, altho it took me two sessions to
 finish. 

Now fully completed after switching to the next later session. 

NOTE - these MOOCs allow one to switch to the next session when one 
falls behind; this is better for getting TA help in the forums when 
there is a problem.

Thanks! (above is same as Class Central, below is new)  How could it be improved?  By having for each required assignment a similar but more difficult optional assignment, which can be further discussed in the forums.  I'd expect that switching auto-grade assignments & sample code to be py3.5, especially the print() change, would be fairly easy and allow students to choose which version to do the assignment it.

I would like to suggest to Dr. Severance that he try Visual Studio Code for the code editor used in the course. The IDE has plugins for a very large selection of languages including Python, but also includes Terminal which is used in place of Command Prompt. This saves always having to restart another program which some students might find really inconvenient, and is much easier to see than Command Prompt. I have a good bit of experience with an older version of Visual Studio programming in C++ and the features in the newest version of Python makes some things in C++ seem quite tedious.  I suspect that some of these features may have been added in newer versions of Visual Studio, but that is just conjecture.

87211813~COURSE!~Y4DUPDpQEeWO-Qq6rEZAow,1628188547139,5,0,"I often skip reading reviews of a course before enrolling as I often find ""most useful reviews"" being a bit harsh even if the average rate is near 5-stars. After I completed this course, I looked up the reviews and I was right about what I thought I was going to find.

So the first thing that has to be addressed is that it's indeed true that this course feels a lot different from the previous two ones. But that's to be expected. The first two ones are too simple and too easy, so it doesn't come as a surprise that you get the feeling that they were better courses overall (as if the explanations were better and the assignments were more reasonable), because they were about simple things that were kept inside Python just to get used to this programming language, but this course is about interacting with other applications and languages without really explaining how they work. 

But explaining what exactly XML, JSON, API's. etc. are and how they work would take at least 1 course more for each one of them. So what can you expect when just 1 course covers all of these while still teaching you the basics of Python? It makes it feel rushed but that doesn't mean that it's bad. As Dr. Chuck has explained before, this specialization is about getting used to Python, getting to know what you can do with it rather than becoming a professional, so that then you can enroll in more courses about Python or other languages and not feel like you're completely lost and this course does that job perfectly. You still get a good idea about what those things are without deeply studying those subjects.

Finall, the assignments are not just tweaking code but you also have to understand how they work, otherwise you would struggle even is most of the code is already written in the examples. You have to figure out a lot of things by yourself but it's not very difficult. You don't have to look up things on Youtube or Stackoverflow as others have stated, that's just exaggerating. Everything you need is in this course or in the provided book.",0,0,Victor Donjuan,87211813

10400300~COURSE!~Y4DUPDpQEeWO-Qq6rEZAow,1613573769355,5,0,"When I was about to start this course after the introductory ones, I was a little upset by the reviews I spotted. The average rate of this course is high, yet the ""most useful"" reviews are negative. Maybe because of this, my own opinion about the course is ""well above expectations"". I will try to address most common points of criticism from other reviews, and hope this helps future students to make a decision.First, it has been claimed that the difficulty of this course is so much higher than in the previous two courses of specialization. I would not say so. Surely, it is more difficult, since it is expected that the students progress as they learn, but I have not felt that the material was enormously sophisticated. Also, the ""entertainment"" pieces have made a good deal of pushing the brain to relax. Then, it has been argued that the stuff in the forums is not polite and does not want to help, mainly making fun of the students. To tell the truth, I have not used forums much. I have asked one question and looked at about 20 most recent conversations at random. I have to say that I noticed noting rude in the stuff replies. In contrast to many other courses I have attended, the forum is alive, which is great! I have received a polite and comprehensive answer to my question in just about 4 hours, amazing! One thing is that the stuff is extremely attentive wiping out the code of the assignments and preventing discussions spoiling correct quiz answers. This may seem ""rude"" to somebody loving to have the assignments partially disclosed in the forums - but guys, we are not for cheating here.Finally, I will cite some reviews. ""Some assignments basically require you to have previous programming experience""; ""If you're a professional looking to learn Python for the first time, you're better off buying a book that provides the answer to an exercise with step-by-step rationale for the process""; ""There was not a single assignment that I did not have to rely on reading tons of extra info from Overstack or other coding sites."". ""The explanations are lacking and I'm left super confused.""I would say - nothing personal, everybody has its own opinion, and impressions can be different. But these seem incorrect _to me_. Yes, this course does require some prior programming skills - but this is course 3 in the specialization, and previous courses are intended to get the required experience. As for the book - I cannot imagine number of pages (guess would be thousands) to cover every bit of access to each type of web data step by step from scratch. The same about lack of details. Come on, you cannot expect learning, say, XML at the level sufficient to apply for a job after 30-60 minutes of lectures! This is enough to give an impression and possibly guide the students in future courses choice, but not to start as a professional programmer. Moreover, I am not sure I will need to parse json a lot, and I would be unhappy to have a separate course on this. Yet, it is good to know that such thing exist not to be confused facing it, and the lectures in this course are perfectly suitable. As for the assignments being poorly related to the in-class material... Well, I would say I have been upset by the _presence_ of too detailed ""working examples"" preceding the assignments! I ended up with making my assignment first and then watching the example to possibly find some drawbacks in my work. And I have never used anything besides the examples provided in the textbook and python documentation to pass the assignments.Ok, I feel that I have written too much already. The last point is about the amount of assignments. During the previous courses it seemed to me that there could be more of programming tasks - 1 or 2 per week is not enough to cover, say, lists, which is essential to whatever you use Python in future. (On the other hand, since we have learned the basics, a lot of calculus tasks are available to us for practice on our own) Well, as for _this_ course, I feel that the assignments are just fine. I cannot claim that I can solve some arbitrary json or xml issue - but if I need, I have gained proper basement to learn the necessary details and features and to understand tutorials.Hope this helps future students whether they enroll in this course or no.

feel week 5 and 6 were a little bit saturated. Not a big concern. I've read some of
other's reviews and I can't explain why this third part of the specialization
was too difficult. I never needed any forum's consultancies and I'm 20 years

Dr. Severance is charismatic and makes the best of a less-than-ideal medium. The assignments ended up being quite fun, but the wording is not always 100% clear, which I imagine poses some problems for those whose English isn't great.The other thing is that the assignments were always more complicated than the examples shown. In some cases, it was possible to apply what we learned; in others, it was necessary to look up how to do certain things. That's not a problem, but expectations should be more clearly communicated because people will waste hours trying to modify code they were shown only to discover that there is a very specific way of writing something. It's akin to showing someone a few collocations in a foreign language and expecting them to intuitively know an idiom they've never seen before.

This course is great! After reading some of the other reviews I think 
some people missed the point, some said that the course was too 
difficult but I disagree, the level of difficulty was perfect, Dr. Chuck
 thought you enough to be able to complete the assignments as long as 
you really tried and not so much that you would just need to copy and 
paste the answer from the lectures. I loved this course and I'll 
continue to take the next one in the coursera specialization.

Dr. Chuck is a great teacher, content creator and an inspiring technologist. I really enjoyed, apart from the core course content, his interviews of original creators such as the WWW, JSON, at the CERN centre etc. It helped me understand and empathise with myself when I found it difficult to grasp certain concepts. I have one complaint though. The teaching staff (especially one Ms Tamara Brunnock) are nasty, rude towards beginner students like me and others. The discussion forums should be a courteous place to exchange thoughts and reveal your ignorances. However these teaching staff bully students with rhetorical questions. I don't know why they are teaching staff if they don't love the subject, love teaching and love interacting with students. I got zero value addition through these discussion forums. In some of these forums, there are external freelancers who help you out and that is the only help you get.

However for me his lectures were sometimes pretty fast when I had difficulty following him and its very normal in a online course. I faced difficulty mainly in the week 4 and week 5  specially webpage parsing using xmlTree where I took longer time then normal.

Although parsing local text files is fine, one of my main goals with Python was learning to use it to interface with APIs in a seamless manner. I was also very curious as to how web scraping is actually performed, and I'm proud to say that I finally learned how it works. This course is very valuable for anyone who feels everything they've learned in Python up until this point is highly theoretical and indispensable for anyone looking to apply their Python knowledge in a professional environment.",0,0,Benjamin Sexton,45332186

There's a lot of arcane stuff in the commands needed to simply set up a connection and there are several places where it's not always clear how to get some code running (eg, twurl, oauth).  Two responses that still make the five star rating make sense:  1) the forum was actually pretty helpful in getting through some of the problems; and 2) learning how to solve problems by poking around and experimenting is part of what we need to learn.  Finally, I think the whole thing of how do you address individual elements of something returned - JSON or XML - should be a bit of a struggle.

This makes it difficult for me to locate my bugs, since I don't know if it's the problem of the logic or the problem of my code structure.The assignments are hard, but they are also easy, because we only need to change a little part of the sample code to get the answers. I don't think it can really challenge students and push us to understand better, because even if I finished all the assignments, I still feel a little confused.But anyway, Dr. Chuck is such a good illustrator as always, and I just hope he can expand a little more so that it can be less confusing.I have a few suggestions:1. Starting from the 2nd course in this series, maybe the first assignment of installing python or posting pictures on forums for students for feedback can be changed into OPTIONAL because most of us who have this course have completed the former courses, and those are repeated workload.2. The assignment sample code for WEEK 5 is wrong! The code provided is for week 6, and that CONFUSED ME A LOT! Please change that asap.3. The assignments can be a little more variable, because although they are difficult enough(regarding students have to understand the concepts), they actually bring little help for students to understand the structures better. We only need to change so little a part in the ending part of the sample code, and it will work.4. Some questions in the quizzes are too tricky and unnecessary for the course material. Like who invented what language? That shouldn't be a thing we should recite. Maybe the quiz questions can focus on more of the understanding of the concepts.Thanks for reading.",0,47,Wenjing Liu,48709732

However, since the lecture videos exploit a lot of the API set ups for Google and Twitter services, I expected assignments would demand these kind of things.  On the other hand, as it is a begginer's course, I thought extremely useful as my first contact in retrieving data in different formats (html, xml, json) and in understanding what an API is.

This time I really had to listen to some lectures twice, to debug my code a hell lot of times and to stick to the sample code a lot.Students, who have programming experience might still think that this course is too slow and easy, but it is a great way for the beginner to learn python.To sum up: great course, uprising difficulties, recommend enrolling after finishing previous courses. 10/10  ",0,0,Ashray Gupta,35676224

With absolutely no prior knowledge of or experience in Python (except lots of curiosity), I came across the first two courses on Coursera.org and loved Dr Charles' videos. It's a well structured course, especially if you have just started learning about Python and wish to build your skills more practically than by mere reading of numerous resources. There are plenty of resources that Dr Chuck (as he is fondly referred to by his students) offers in the duration of the course. I especially enjoy the bonus videos that accompany this course. They really help increase your knowledge base and urge you to know and be better and try your hand at various things.

The course wasn't so easy as the previous courses in the specialization as I had to spend more time debugging and practicing, nevertheless, it was lot more fun.

There are many things I liked in this course. The discussion forums were great, the videos and slides were really cool and the mentors did great stuff like checking your code for you and other good stuffs. Becoming a programmer is subject to many constraints and the chiefest of this is the need for mentor-ship and the Python for Everybody team understands this so well.There is just one flaw. I recommend more sample projects, more course work , more content, and more work files but this would make the course boring, last much more longer and nobody wants to grow grey hair learning python. The best way to take care of this might be to introduce an additional course.

I learned a LOT!My only critique, is that many times when I am trying to fully understand how some code works within the presentation, the presentation will suddenly show the instructor speaking briefly, and then go back to the code. We don't need to see Steve. When he's trying to explain how code works during the presentation, just show the code. This allows me to understand what's going on while he's still speaking. Otherwise I need to pause the video, and by that point I'm no longer focused on what he was talking about.Otherwise, this course is near perfect, and I've learned a ton from it.

Granted, this is still a broad overview and we didn't dive too deep (this is a good thing) into REGEX, XML, JSON, along with different libraries (urllib, beautiful soup, etc) but I'm no longer intimidated by the terms and have a great understanding of at least what they are and why there are used.  This class is a great foundation upon which one can build with further study.

Everything explained very well, enabling doing simple steps to quickly achieving results. For those who alreay know some programming I would really recommend starting from this course and skipping the first 2 courses. Skipping means it's better to read the first 10 chapters Dr. Chucks's book through and start this course right after that. It will save your time allowing not ot do too simple tasks but just read about the Python syntax. The course is also great because of Dr. Chuck's talent to explaing everything with fun and ease.

People use Python for many purposes: to make games, build web services, to solve business problems, to work with sensors, drivers and robots. Python is also used heavily in scientific fields for academic research and applied work. 


Python is an incredibly efficient language: your programs will do more 
in fewer lines of code than many other languages would require. 
Py4inf and Python explained by C. Servance, is a great developing of the foundations in programming (first two courses) that will serve you well for the rest of your life, as well as a course that will give you a sort of try to understanding of what great things python can do for you.I strongly recommend this course for anybody, who wants to start with informatics.",0,0,Kry,17014571

I really like how each video is an in-depth look at a specific example and that he tells you what to ignore and when. I think his sense of what's important is spot on as I've already started to apply some of his lessons to personal work and find that as I work through personal projects, the next question I have is usually covered in the next lecture or soon thereafter. The videos build on one another in a very coherent manner and the assignments are applicable to what you learned. I think the assignments could be a little more challenging and that more references to the book should be included in the lectures as the book is also very helpful and a great primer for each week's material, especially when it comes to understanding parsing XML and JSON more.

I've basically binge-watched almost every lecture/course he's headed up.  I've always been a little embarrassed to say I code in Python when talking with professional Developers.  I just thought it was an entry level language with limited capabilities.  Now i'm proud to say i code in Python.

My prior reviews were so ravingly positive that I now feel compelled to offer a very minor area of potential improvement:  Dr. Chuck might have considered going a bit deeper into Geojson API and perhaps even done a second API.  Also there were some glitches in the Geojson assignment:  My python Spyder was left frozen a couple times before I got things working.I understand that some students would have complained due to the length of Week 6, but if you requested the simple first assignment completion after the first 10 minutes of video lecture, you could have snuck in two concrete API assignments later on.  Also, you could have had a Week 7 with the second API and alternate Web Access assignments.  In sum, I was left wishing I had a bit more API experience.Nevertheless, I give this class 4.75 stars, which rounds up to the usual 5 stars.

If you are coming from the first four Python for Everyone courses, you will find this one a noticeable step up in difficulty. This course uses Python 2 but I personally did all the code in Python 3 – it's possible, but be prepared to make changes and look up differences in modules between 2 and 3.My co-students were also really helpful on the forums, although the rule not to post your source code makes trouble shooting difficult and laborious.The one thing I found missing was the professor instructing and engaging you more on how to read and make use of documentation. It's a core skill for a programmer! With all the Python modules used in this course (Beautiful Soup, ET, XML, JSON) you are bound to come across situations where reading the documentation will open up many new pathways and enhance your understanding.All in all a fun learning experience.
