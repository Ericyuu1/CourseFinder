67887672~COURSE!~meHFISNAEemoOwqGUUJH-g,1624747303459,3,0,"Overall the information in the course is great. The lectures are a bit boring. I do not feel like there is any interaction between the instructor and the students, if you have a question about things there are only links to the forums which are not that active.  It is also a little bit concerning that a portion of your grade is dependent on peer reviewed fact sheets. Making the fact sheet isn't the problem, it is hoping that there are not only at least 1 peer taking the course to review yours, but 3 other peers taking the course to be able to review their fact sheets. at this point I am making my final fact sheet for the courses, but it is worth half of my grade. I was able to have someone review my fact sheet in part 2 of the course but I have only been able to review one other fact sheet and I check back 5 days a week. (This is a work based training and I don't want to do this through my phone). I have tried to ask what happens if your work is not reviewed or if you can not review other's work before the due dates but no one has sent me a DM. I also think that the course could be updated with info about cannabis use and it's effects on COVID 19. ",0,3,Rachael Gonzalez,67887672

30648716~COURSE!~meHFISNAEemoOwqGUUJH-g,1652014249209,4,0,"Nice. In line with my education, made me see the importance of understian both normal and abnormal psychology and neurology. The thing that most disturbs me about the way Coursera has evolved is that the learning is siloed. To hold onto what one learns they need to interact with the material. One way of doing that is to have discussion with peers and fellow students. This is a specialized class so it is harder to have the discussions with peers. On line learning has facilitated a just do the class work and move on. Very sad.",0,1,Ann Fuller,30648716
