120254929~COURSE!~B33JDUFsEeyZlQoNyXy15Q,1672468935112,4,0,"The course syllabus was efficient. The quiz questions were relevant to the content and prepared professionally. However, the course does not focus on the each phase of the project lifecycle but mostly planning methods. i liked the assignments; however, when it comes to Gantt Chart, the lesson could be demonstrated on a software or excel instead of on a white board using cards and markers. Thank you very much for organising the course.",0,1,Gamze Kazar,120254929
