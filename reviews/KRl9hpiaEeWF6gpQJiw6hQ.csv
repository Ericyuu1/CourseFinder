111338383~COURSE!~KRl9hpiaEeWF6gpQJiw6hQ,1665933064364,1,0,"​ This course is unmonitored and extremely outdated. There is rarely any real participation because no one checks. It's easy to cheat and 75% of what I see is just that - cheating. It's unfortunate, because some information is timeless (composition will always be composition), but it's so outweighed by the three weeks spent learning an app which no longer exists. It's a real shame. Six years ago this was probably fantastic, but now? Barely worth the effort for the most part. ",0,0,Judith Chesley,111338383

And then maybe 5 minutes somewhere in between of those there will be tips how to make photos. The talks most of the time put me to sleep or I have to follow the printed version and skip all of the chats.

A session about smartphone has been included and an assignment on this item is requested too, but I think that it could have been added as a separate course, because many amateur photographer are not interested in this part.
