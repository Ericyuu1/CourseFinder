I don't mind being scored low, but if there is no feedback, how am I supposed to know what I did wrong and how to fix it? How can I be sure the reviewer wasn't just being mean? Due to the timing and the lack of feedback, I'm fairly certain that people were just retaliating against me.

I understand that that may be the case in real life, but I'm paying you for this, not the other way around.

Working with Figma was fun, but having to create *everything* from scratch for the vast majority of the assignments (all of them, if you count making my own paper wireframes and importing them) got old pretty quick. It would be far more reasonable pacing to have the projects broken down into smaller stages, and have an actual complete piece of work to display by the end of this course, after 3 ""months"" worth of work-weeks. 

This course is also still just starting to scratch the surface of visual design elements, and if I had known how little design work I was actually going to put into practice during the course of these early courses I'd probably have gone a different way.

I'd like for it to offer some more theoretical principles and information though. Or at least more external readings and videos approved by the instructors.
I​'ve been twice graded with 0 in this course by people who obviously didn't know better or were malicious in their grading. For example, when I shared my prototype in FIgma, someone gave me 0 on all 3 counts because I didn't share just the prototype itself, but rather, the whole project. The prototype was, of course, available in the link I shared with a simple click on the ""Play"" button. Something they had to know, having themselves worked with Figma. I've had myself graded at least 8 other assignments and other people were also sharing their whole project and not just the prototype. Sure, the assignment instructions were requesting for the prototype to be shared, but seeing the whole thing is much more educational, open and collegial. So, I guess while peer grading works beautifully most of the time, I think some people may require further instructions on how to do it. For example, they could flag the sumbission for it being incomplete or if something iswrong. Or what to do in certain situations. I have a background in education, so I know it's not always black and white.Obviously, you can just resumbit the assignment and be done with it, but I'd just like to share my experience with whoever wants to hear it.

It'd be better to know this ahead of time so students could prepare or create wireframes of those screens at the same time they're creating the homepage wireframes.In the low-fidelity prototype assignment at the end of Week 3, the submission process could be improved. I created a 10-screen prototype and connected far more nodes than the course required, making a fairly functional app. I had to resubmit three times because other students didn't understand how to operate Figma and were rushing through the reviews.

Another exiting activity was creating digital wireframe from paper wire frames using the exciting tool called figma. One interesting activity kept following one another after building digital wire frames up next was constructing low fidelity paper prototypes which led to going back to figma to create digital prototypes. Working with figma has been very engaging and exciting when building my prototype I faced a slight challenge with linking some pages I don’t know if figma was taking its time to save the work other than that I enjoyed this course and the instructor was awesome.

Specifically the video with transcript and the transcript highlighting the text being spoken in the video makes the UX much more productive by allowing student  to rewind, review and remember!In my perception I noticed while submitting the prototype of CoffeeHouse there was an option (with link icon) to submit as a clickable link whereas when I submitted my portfolio ArtAnywhere there was no link visible and entire webpage address of Figma had to copy pasted, which may be a small inconvenience for the peer reviewer to copy paste into the browser and view.A suggestion is that whenever the submission is viewed the system should generate a email notification to the submitter.Currently the search function by key words doesn't work in the submission page, it would help if search works!Thanks for the education, training and this opportunity to  comment and give feed back.Happy Holidays and Happy Healthier New Year 2021.Best regards,Madu.Email: farmermadu@gmail.com
