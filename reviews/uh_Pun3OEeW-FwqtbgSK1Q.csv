Personally , I took this course to practice python programming as I had a bit of  programming experience in my first sem of college. But , I must say I wish I had taken this course earlier ie. as a complete beginner. The approach followed by the professors is ""Just in Time"" and not flooding the lectures with as much info as they can. 

The highlight of the course are ofcourse the Games that you get to make using SimpleGui. ( My personal favourite is the Black Jack - taught me a great deal of things about OOPS). After completing both IIPP-1 and IIPP-2 I now feel a lot more comfortable while reading other people's code. So, all in all even though you will be making games here, the skills you learn will be applicable everywhere.
One thing I was worried about before taking this class was that it is in Python 2. I can assure you this won't be a problem as-
The only difference you will notice in Python 3 is that print is a function now and / is used a little differently that's all. 

For advanced and semi-advanced people this course may be a bit dull just like any Introduction Course.  But for beginners and those who are not yet comfortable in writing long lines of code this course is simply one of the best.

The professors are very well versed in the topic and they do a very nice job in presenting the subject matter. However, be warned that you will need to do some outside research and reading on the subjects covered.  Especially when the topic of classes is covered.  The subject can get confusing quickly and some backup books or websites will be very useful in understanding them. The coding is done in python 2.5 or 2.6 (I believe). As of now, the current iteration is 3.6.  This is not a problem. The logic and code structure that they are teaching is the same regardless of which version you end up using and it is really not an issue to transition from 2.5/2.6 to 3.6.  So, please don't let this prevent you from signing up. You'll gain a real sense of accomplishment when you finish. ",0,5,Eugen Wichmann,28160388
