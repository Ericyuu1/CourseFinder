12012146~COURSE!~HStXPFUPEeijOhIn2e06zA,1595449389723,1,0,Very shallow and uninformative. Nothing that cannot be learned with a 30 minutes read plus another 30 minutes looking at the survival package in R. Certainly doesn't merit the cost of subscribing to the specialization,0,2,Paco Cruz,12012146

It only discusses very basic ideas such as the hazard function and the cox model which could be discussed in like 20 minutes. There are a lot of unnecessary discussion around multivariate regression and missing values that belong to a course on regression analysis and not survival analysis. The R code is a bit faulty and could be improved. Overall, I don't think this could be a good course on survival analysis.",0,5,Aboozar Hadavand,6325073

This last course (survival analysis) was equally informative, but desperately needs attention to the course presentation. The video transcripts were still raw (there needs to be an easy way for students like me who created cleaned video transcripts to upload them), two of the Week 4 quizzes would not accept the correct answers generated by the current software release (answer key needs to be updated), and the course itself needs someone to spend a few hours looking for bugs, typos, and doing polishing.
