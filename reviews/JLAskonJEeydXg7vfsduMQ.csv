Several previous leadership certificate programs were discontinued, and I was overjoyed to see this Ethical Leadership specialization program available. Leading from Within had me from the start. Very well presented with an opportunity for self-reflection.

I would completely enjoy taking a course from him IN PERSON!   Other courses have been less 'inviting' but his delivery was EXCELLENT!   I feel that I have made a new friend in the delivery and the content of this course.  I will certainly be keeping my notes from this course close at hand as I strive to be a better Leader From Within!  ,0,0,Laura Hoffman,98302551
