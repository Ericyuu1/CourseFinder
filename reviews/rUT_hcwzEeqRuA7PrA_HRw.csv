I have never felt so inspired and I truly believe learning about the different religions about the world and connecting it to ecology can hopefully improve the world we live in, and better yet improve ourselves and change our attitude towards nature. Thank you to those who collaborated to create this amazing course. I will never regret taking it. It amazes me how much I have learned in this little course, compared to what I have been learning in school and all of my life. I can't put into words how much all of the videos and scriptures enthralled me throughout the lessons. ",0,0,Na-Yeon Kim,111370015

12723511~COURSE!~rUT_hcwzEeqRuA7PrA_HRw,1652243615803,5,0,"The course on East Asian religions and ecology was very illuminating. I learned a lot about Confucianism and Daoism, plus, I was able to see how different the expression of Buddhism is in East Asia, compared to where it originated in South Asia. I also loved learning about Shinto and Korean Shamanism; and how all these diverse religions either subtly or more forcefully champion the cause of ecological protection.
