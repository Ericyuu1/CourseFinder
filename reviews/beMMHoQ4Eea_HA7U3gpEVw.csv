14203979~COURSE!~beMMHoQ4Eea_HA7U3gpEVw,1631575819682,3,0,"These courses are good, but there are some errors that need to be corrected for future students.    The first practice tests covers information that hasn't yet been covered in the videos.    The writing practice quizzes are a source of frustration for all students per the forum.  I question whether you really want students who may or may not understand the language grading students who may or may not understand the language.   I could not pass a peer assignment until the Coursera help staff moved me to a new session.   I went from failing every peer exercise to passing the peer exercises with an almost perfect grade.   The quality of the peer students really impact your grade in this course.   Also, there are errors in many of the tests and evaluation criteria that have been noted in forums, but not corrected by the staff.   Some of the comments recommending corrections are over a year old.",0,0,Donna Quinn Coletti,14203979

61426177~COURSE!~beMMHoQ4Eea_HA7U3gpEVw,1593549359242,3,0,"I do feel like the course improved my Spanish. However, the video lessons from the professor are too short to make a significant impact. In addition, there are often inconsistencies between what he says and what is written in the graphics. The vocabulary practice quizzes always include questions about grammar topics that are not taught until after those respective quizzes. Overall, I learned a lot, but the course could use some cleaning up.",0,0,Joshua Rey,61426177
30434276~COURSE!~beMMHoQ4Eea_HA7U3gpEVw,1520913666457,3,0,"Generally speaking I think the course content is good, but I rated this course average because of three main reasons.1).  I think a little more effort to organize the material would go a long way.  For example, the grammar presentations refer to new vocabulary words that were not introduced in the vocabulary list, and the vocabulary exams refer to content in the grammar section. It would be nice if the curriculum were designed so that you could study the vocabulary, take the vocabulary exam, then review the grammar and leverage what you learned in the vocabulary section to re-enforce your learning.2).  I also think that some of the topics deserve additional clarifications, and the presentations themselves are very short.  I appreciate the length of the presentations when reviewing the presentations to refresh my memory, but difficult concepts sometimes require more attention than they are given.  In some cases, it seems as though an elegant choice of words to describe a difficult concept is more important than taking the time to deconstruct that concept into simple phrases.3).  Lastly, there are errors in the presentations and exams, and little to no involvement from the professor to clarify points and/or correct those issues.  I have noticed comments from students who have reported the same issues for the past two years, and those issues are still not corrected.  I used to comment on the message boards for clarifications and to report errors, but after getting zero responses from the professor I stopped participating.Conclusion:Overall, I think it's a good course - it provides a good structure for learning the Spanish language despite the above shortcomings.  Although they appear very simple to address, I see the same shortcomings exhibited by every course in the series.",0,1,Bryan Chin,30434276
51111977~COURSE!~beMMHoQ4Eea_HA7U3gpEVw,1620670325156,4,0,"I have really enjoyed the three Spanish courses offered by UC Davis through Coursera. I have enjoyed the exercises to learn the vocabulary and learning the grammar constructions. I also enjoy applying the week's vocabulary and grammar to an assignment about myself. This brings all the teaching points together. There are a couple of things that might improve the experience. I struggle with grammar and one of the grammar exercises does not provide correct answers. It would be good to see the right answer so I know where I am making mistakes.Secondly, I have had difficulty accessing the peer-reviewed assignments.  There are Youtube or other links on the assignment page but there is no hyperlink to the student's video. I hope this can be resolved.",0,0,Damian Bye,51111977
