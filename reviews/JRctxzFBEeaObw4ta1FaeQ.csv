20848135~COURSE!~JRctxzFBEeaObw4ta1FaeQ,1531827894992,1,0,"I’m struggling with this Coursera HSK3 programme because the quality is really not good.  Frankly, after a lot of trying, I give up on this Coursera HSK3 programme.  I’ve done HSK 2, all 5 Pimsleur levels and spent time in 8 cities in China. Quality is not great:The Transcript is not always availableThe explanations are not sufficient/ non existent to understand the grammar.The English spoken is strange and regularly is not great English, e.g. at the end of each video introducing vocabulary she, says “Lets learn some words more”. This is not a well polished course worthy of being on Coursera.The English used in translations are also sometimes strange or even don’t really make sense. For a course I’m paying for, I do expect that the creators of this course would at least get a natural English speaker to review and contribute.  This course feels sloppy and it doesn’t appear that sufficient effort has been put into making it.The ‘guest videos’ have sound sometimes at different level compared to the rest of the training videos. I miss the start of the speaking in the video as I’m trying to adjust the volume.Even the presentation slide is not quite level/ straight on screenI’ve done several other Coursera programmes in different knowledge domains and the standard of this course is the worst by far.The presenters permanent fixed grin is strange and feels insincere and a bit disturbing. The style of tilting her head back means that she is talking down her nose to me as if I’m a little child who knows nothing.  Her relatively static delivery is unengaging to the point of dullness.  Her voice dynamics are limited which only further distances me.  The approach is very old-school, dull and not effective at putting the info into memoryJust “repeat after me” vocabulary with one or two limited examples of only a few of the total vocab list The volume of material per week is enormous.  For a part-time course, this is ridiculous.  I’ve done several other Coursera programmes in different knowledge domains and none just throw masses of material at you like this.  I know that I’m a particularly bad student, but it took me a month to do one week’s material. The tests are useful, probably the most useful part.    RecommendationsStart by studying the Coursera “Learning how to Learn” course!  Apply all these basic and well-known ideas, including spaced repetition, chunking, etc.  Teaching does not equal learning: you as the teachers are responsible for making my learning successful.  Fix the basic mistakes: some translations are just wrong, ensure that the English you use is correct (at minimum, a natural English speaker needs to thoroughly review everything), e.g. “感冒的时候，你吃不吃感冒药？Gǎnmào de shíhou，nǐchībuchīɡǎnmào yào?  Do you have taken cold medicine when you caught a cold?” from Discussion Prompt, Lesson 3 Make the HSK3 course much more interactive: keep the tests, add many other forms of interaction, especially ones that use new vocabulary in real sentences, Introduce a way to assess student’s ability to pronounce words and phrases, like language learning Apps such as BabelAt the start of the course, provide an overview that shows how the total of HSK3 material will be covered, then refer to this each week to show what has been achieved.  I am not very clear what sort of progress I am making on learning the HSK3 material, so am lost, confused and demotivated.Put a focus on how to learn characters.Characters are not required knowledge in HSK1 or HSK2, so are the key new dimension in HSK3.  What are effective strategies for learning characters? Do I need to recognize them (so I can read and can type Pinyin to convert into hanzi) or take this further and be able to hand-write them?How can you help me get good at taking the HSK exams?  What guidance, what tips, what practice routines?Use a presenter that is more dynamic and not scaring me with a permanent grin while looking down her nose at me. See how some of the good Coursera presenters use body language and voice. You just give examples of Separable Words without explaining how it works or what the Chinese means!  What is 跳跳舞?",0,13,Tim Cooper,20848135

I really enjoyed the teacher's lessons.I will explain why I gave 4/5 stars:1) DIALOGUE (Quality of audio). Similar to other Chinese courses here at Coursera, the audio quality of the dialogue is not the best. There is background and static audio noise. Raising the volume makes it even harder to listen. Some dialogues are better than others.2) DIALOGUE (Speed). Some of the dialogues were not at all useful to me as the speed of the speakers was extremely fast. I visit China often and I can say that most people won;t speak as fast as some of these dialogues. Again, some dialogues were better than others.3) Week 7 FINAL Test - It is insanely hard compared to the daily/weekly quizzes. I did well in the quizzes (most with 100% scores on first trial). By the time I got to the final, I thought I was going to do really well. Was I wrong! There are two reasons why I found the final to be so difficult. (i) the Listening Part is really really hard. I couldn't understand most of it in the first trial. Maybe something to do with the fact that I didn't get much out of the class dialogues (as described above). (ii) In order to do well in the final, you have to read Hanzi really well. I wish the class had Hanzi lectures and quizzes. ",0,2,Marcus Vinicius Batista Ferrandini,45362515

5736798~COURSE!~JRctxzFBEeaObw4ta1FaeQ,1517720722432,5,0,"It is quite remarkable that this class got us through, with so much to learn, in a short 7 weeks. The hard part, for me, was to not be afraid of tackling material that felt way harder than HSK2. I noticed that, if I persevere, even if I felt the amount of content was a little over my head sometimes, with constant review and being well organized to never miss a deadline, it is doable. My take-away here is that the class could easily stretch over a semester, with two lessons a week, so that we have time to assimilate the vocabulary, practice writing the text in 汉字, in Chinese characters, practice permutations in grammar exercises, and nurture long-term memorization.It is normal to “feel behind,” I think, unless you already live in an environment with Chinese speakers all around you all the time. Above all, the teachers were superb, enunciating very clearly, making distinctions between tones, exceptions, giving us a few rules at a time. The vocabulary was very varied, sometimes embedded into very funny situations, which makes learning even easier.So, for all of you future HSK learners, don’t bei ntimidated by the class. It is absolutely doable. It is well-taught, by first-rate teachers, and you never have to wonder whether the expressions you are being taught are actually correct Chinese. The class, in that respect is rock-solid. Forgive the few awkward English translations sometimes, Chinese and English do not always “meet” exaclty at the same point.And it’s so rewarding to realize I can read far more in Mandaring Chinese than I used to just a few weeks ago.
