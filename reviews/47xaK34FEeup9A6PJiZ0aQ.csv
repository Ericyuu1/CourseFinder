I couldn't get any of the graphs, charts or maps to show any data.  At times you couldn't see where the instructor was clicking.  I think this class has great potential, but it just needs some fine tuning. The instructor had a positive vibe.",0,0,Kim Shaieb,117493886

84103729~COURSE!~47xaK34FEeup9A6PJiZ0aQ,1654987377563,4,0,"***IMPORTANT!*** Are you not getting the same results in the video and turned to reviews for the answer? This may help and I found it to be a solution.For this project to work as shown in video, the in-screen desktop's date and time need to be set to February 18, 2021. This is done by: Windows Home Button<Control Panel< Date and Time<Set date and time.As the project continues to run, the in-screen desktop will periodically reconnect with the internet and reupdate it's date and time to the current date and time. You may notice your graphs and/or dashboard change. You may need to go back and reset the date and time to February 18, 2021. When you reset the date and time, it will not automatically refresh. It may take a while for the in-screen desktop to update the date and time with Tableau Public.If you do this, you can follow along as shown in the video. After figuring this out, as a beginner Tableau user, this was well worth my time and effort and you can see how this would be a consistently updating dashboard reflecting real time data. It's by very nature of it's programming to keep itself up-to-date that prohibits following along with our current date time.",0,14,Christian Woodfin,84103729

While there are minor but noticeable quality control issues with the video and the quiz, it runs through creating calculating fields to building charts to creating a dashboard and formatting.
