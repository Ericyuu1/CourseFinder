It is intended to provide anyone to consider their First Nations role in shaping their land today. I can see this course being used as a short course before a semester where a student will be working with Indigenous Australians. Those looking for an introduction to Australian Indigenous culture will be left wanting more, as it doesn't focus on any understanding of even Aboriginal Sydney culture. The reasoning why hidden in the videos and readings is for the student to reach out and speak to Indigenous people (either directly, or via a tour) and to understand them on their terms, but it is not part of the course structure.
