Good content, very useful
Highlighted cells during the actual course was a plus
Instructor voice was NOT boring
Meaningful examples and exercises

Cons:
The course title is incorrect. It is not EverydayExcel Part 1, but rather Advanced Excel Part 1!!

The weekly files did not include all of the excel files used in the screencasts.

It might have been better to have one workbook for each week rather than tens of Excel files. It took a long time to close one, open another, and then return to the first one after only a few minutes!

There are too many screencasts, while some could be combined into one.

When trying to find the appropriate content for review, the title of the screencast was not helpful. Perhaps a few function names in the title would have been useful and would have made the search easier.

There was no summary slide available as a pdf at the end of each section or week, nor was there any  summary slides of the functions covered.

The pace is too quick for this level of course. Not suitable for beginners.

The exercises were much more difficult than the actual class examples. In fact, other appropriate usage of the same functions were not taught in class at all, but it was needed to solve the assignments.
No appropriate hint in assignments toward the end of the course. There were some in week 1 and 2 I believe.

The quiz pictures were difficult to follow; there was no way to see the question and check a, b, c, d answers. Scrolling up and down was both time consuming and perplexing.

Tables in the quizzes could not be copied and pasted into a spreadsheet to aid in calculations. I had to manually copy! If it wasn't supposed to be that way, the answers would have been too difficult to obtain with just a pen and paper.

The incorrect answer and the rest of the choices given in the question were not included in the quiz answer/review pages, so the reader could see the full questions and answers. I had to switch back and forth between the feedback page and answers review page.",0,1,Ramsey Alizadeh,91061865

It is quite apparent that the professor knows Excel very well and has put in a great amount of time to create this course.  Although, there are big drawbacks to taking this course.  Learning  Excel is like learning to play a musical instrument.  It takes a lot of practice to learn new skills. There is not any ""homework""  provided for practicing the skills learned and there is no help from the professor when you have a question.  If you get stuck on the assignments, which are complicated, you are supposed to write a question in the discussion forum, but the professor does not respond to the questions.

I pushed trough and I must say I am glad I did, overall I found the course good.Reason for the low(ish) rating is mainly because, you have to do all the previous steps to unlock the subsequent material and, If you don't finish the course in the allowed time, the videos remain available but the material you haven't unlocked it's locked for good. That's a pity because the assignments (macro enabled workbooks) are truly good to have as examples. I imagined that, once you paid for the course (49 Dollars), all the material is yours. That is not the case: for example, if you finish week 3 and then leave and the time expires, then you don't get your certificate AND, the material in week 4 and 5 doesn't unlock unless you pay again and you ""earn"" it.

This is not my first course on Coursera, but definitely the BEST one so far! Someone mentioned that course requires some additional knowledge and I can say confidently that tips from tutor are enough to understand what is asked from you if you will read everything carefully. Also someone found it fast pasting (including explanations of teacher), but this made me like this course even more, because if you need time, you always able to pause/replay the video (that the greatness of online courses after all, noone hurrys up you), and you don't have to listen some information once and once again if you get it by the first time. The greatest part of this course is practice, lots of it. And it is interesting at the same time, because you see as example where you can later implement your gained knowledge. Plus, teacher explain difference of Excel versions and not ""just advertise Excel 365"" but doing quite oposite - he shows the way to solve a problem for EVERY versions of Excel (if possible) and you don't have to suffer by searching in the internet why something doesn't work in your version. Amazing! Big thanks to the creator of the course!!! It is an example for everyone how course should be created.

I have used Excel for many years but found the review to be very helpful, and it exposed some areas that I had apparently not mastered previously (surprise!). Additionally, pointing out the new features in Excel 365 was very helpful. I initially started out the class in my older version (2016), but soon found the new features very helpful to practice with and updated my subscription. I think a quick minute or two on ""what's new"" in 365 would be helpful; I found a few additional features that weren't covered like XLOOKUP.  I had taken Charlie's VBA specialization in 2018, and found his instructional style very accessible and his teaching approach, with examples, very helpful - this  course also reflects the care he puts into his instruction development. Overall, a very helpful course and I'll look forward to parts 2 and 3.",0,4,Richard Manley,1796276
