68946190~COURSE!~HITLfhnoEeWjrA6seF25aw,1601073715828,1,0,"I am very disappointed with this course. I thought it is for the beginners but there are a lot of points that you cannot pass unless you are a programmer. I am mostly disappointed with coursera and it's refund policy. It says that I can still get  a refund if I do it during the first two weeks. Well funny story, the course started really failing on the third week when I couldn't get a refund anymore and there is no way to find how to contact coursera about this. 

Now whats wrong with the course. In the first two lessons there were some codes/tags that were not working. I was doind everything exactly like on the course but I guess something has an upgrade and the tags we learned during the course didn't work. Also the chat section is not much of a help as nobody is replying. I figured out a few tags by myself that gave the function i was looking for (completely different from the course) but after a couple more i got frustrated and disappointed but decided to continue with the course because the tags were just few extras and obviously I don't expect to learn all of them during this intro course to coding. 
Well week 3 was a surprise beause lots of things were mentioned like this: ""as you learned during the first 2 weeks"", and basically the guy was talking about something that was completely new and  was never ever mentioned during the first course.

Also the exams are not fun to do because there is a lot that you face in the exams that were never tought before. Basically you learn stuff during the exam by guessing the answers. Some are modified and some tags are changed a bit so they are just modifying the things that were tought before, but some stuff is completely new and there is no way a beginner can do that!!!!

After few lessons of week 3 i tried to find a solution to get my money back but apparently there is no option like that so I leave this as it is, lose my money and leave a bad review to this course. Sorry but this is unfair for us who want to learn and understand this well.

They'll just assume you'll study on your own which makes them lazy.Also, in Week 2 - CSS, they didn't explain different CSS selectors, they just directly introduced pseudo-classes (a:hover), class selectors (.index), they did not explain the Box Model and directly introduced the concept of margins (margin-left, margin-bottom), they did not explain measurement units and directly introduced pixels (px) and points (pt). They somehow assume that the students have some background when this course should talk about the basics.Week 3 was so demanding, the instructors introduced jQuery but did not fully explain its syntax and basic concepts. The instructors just handed some links and they assumed we know jQuery in an instant which is so stupid. They introduced complex jQuery codes that are not really for beginners, this course was supposed to cover the ""basics"" lol shame. The week 3 peer-graded assignment was trash, we did not even perform any JavaScript or jQuery code.In Week 4 ""eReader example"" the instructor introduced very complex javascript/jQuery functions which is hard for beginners.

To start off, the instructors are very good - despite how oddly the content is structured at times, they do a great job of presenting it in a clear and concise way. Unfortunately, the core weakness of the course lies in how the content is present. While this is a beginner course, the content jumps around substantially in a way that doesn't give a beginner enough time or resources to full grasp the material. Seriously, only covering the DOM with jQuery and just briefly touching on JavaScript document.getElementById in a quiz seems incredibly rushed and doesn't provide the foundational knowledge in JavaScript that I would expect from a course of this nature.
