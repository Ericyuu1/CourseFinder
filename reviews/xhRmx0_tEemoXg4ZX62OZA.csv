102870559~COURSE!~xhRmx0_tEemoXg4ZX62OZA,1650504009130,1,0,"As someone who paid out-of-pocket for this course, it was most dissapointing and appeared to have been low effort (they just linked to the AWS main page and expect you to keep clicking until you get to a potential quiz topic.) The most effective strategy was to start with the quiz and Google my way backwards and use YouTube videos to get a better analysis of topics covered (Be A Better Developer requires an insane amount of credit for producing this content for free). The discussion forums are useless as the last known post in the forums I used were months behind (and questions were left unanswered) - and there was no means of communicating with an instructor directly. It felt like the instructors spent more time coming up with the Bee themed videos than on course material; which is a harsh thing to say, but only because I believe they were far more capable and knowledgeable than how the course was presented.

Another example of a frustration was the emphasis on ""checking out the resource section"". I interpreted this to mean the Reading sections of class, since I was unable to locate a section called Resources. ",0,1,Deleted Account,102870559

The course is supposed to explain to beginners all this stuff and not just to list all the available AWS documentation pages. I am perfectly capable to go to the AWS website and read documentation myself - I do not need a course for that. What I expect from the course, is a creative (and I do not mean that ridiculous attempt to make this course “fun” which was, in fact, so awkward that it made me uncomfortable sometimes) approach to explain the material to students who are striving to really understand how things work and not just to sheepishly memorise all those names of the available services. In many ways, this course feels like shining marketing material with a clear goal to attract new clients to AWS rather than educational material for those who try to understand how it actually works and what all this means. Overall, the course feels disorganised, immature, raw, chaotic and sloppy. I agree with other reviewers of the course that quizzes often were rather random and consisted topics which supposed to be either in the future lessons or such details that were not covered altogether. P.S. Lots of errors and typos in video transcripts (""ash tree"" instead of S3, for example) and also quizzes, such as, for instance, JBDC connection instead of JDBC connection (Quiz Week 3, Quiz 2). What about attention to details?",0,31,Alina Frolova,27130772
