I found the class so frustrating that I dropped it after a few weeks of coursework.  The instructor seems like a nice person, but three things really got in the way of learning: (1) the professor does not speak into the camera, and instead is filmed having more casual conversations on stage with 2 of her students. I felt like I was watching someone else's in-office conversation. It was hard to see her visuals and hard to figure out what was important. (2) she does not have a prepared script and ends up saying ""um"" constantly. (3) She used lots of technical terminology and language  - the academic names that scholars give their behavior change theories.  The tests and assignments were an odd mix of ""what is the name of this theory"" and ""come up with a plan to change your own life."" Was this class for public health students or people seeking to change their health behavior? Those two audiences need different approaches. I really do not recommend this class - it does not work for either.",0,4,Meghan Bishop,53215422

The slides are not able to be read/seen because the camera is on the grad students or the three of them having their conversation instead of engaging the person taking the class.  The grad students didn't add anything to the online learner.  It would have been much more interesting and engaging for us the learners to have a pop up asking the questions she asked of the grad students even if she isn't directly ""listening"" or ""viewing"" the our responses.  It was very annoying and I just wanted to get through the material because it was clear the instructor was not at all interested in engaging the online student.

It would have been better to call it Public Health, since dedicating a big part of the course to anxiety and depression is nto exactly what I expected when I chose a course about changing health behaviors. And on that note, it would be better to concentrate more about actually changing health behaviors (e.g., examples on how to use each technique, research on the topic). There is also a problem with the assignment that is peer reviewed (some students are not very honest and no one is monitoring it), and the quizes need to be double checked (I remember that the answer to the final question in the final quiz was wrong, because impressions form a study aren't facts of findings).

The style of this course is very casual, but very well-informed, which really helps with staying interested (normally a challenge with online learning, especially with so many interactions moving online during the COVID-19 pandemic). And the assignments are almost entirely based on self-improvement, developing personal behavior change goals to get firsthand experience with the challenges of behavior change, encouraging reflection on the successes and shortcomings of various strategies. I would absolutely recommend this course, particularly to undergraduate or graduate students, who constitute a particularly vulnerable population to mental health, physical activity, and nutrition struggles (an unfortunate side-effect of our current higher education system in the US). In a world that constantly demands an endless ""grind,"" this course is a welcome respite that's taught me new tools for self-reflective personal growth, and expanded my empathy—both for others as well as for myself—for the challenges of effecting long-term development and maintenance of healthier behavior patterns. 11/10 rating :)",0,2,Matthew Paige,108631495
