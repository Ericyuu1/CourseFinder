39743371~COURSE!~3XEY9ItuEeiIRxKvaAZJ0A,1638528752816,1,0,"I hate to give a negative review and I don't want to blame the teachers, I'm sure they were given a very limited time to make this course. But t​his is unfortunately the worst course I have ever participated in. The lectures are okay at first, but quickly get repetitive. Most of the assignments feel like pointless wastes of time, and there are A LOT of them. There are no teachers in the course, just automated quizzes and students ""grading"" eachother. This course is a quite bad look for the unversity and american education in general.",0,2,Deleted Account,39743371
90485373~COURSE!~3XEY9ItuEeiIRxKvaAZJ0A,1633892067412,1,0,"The course has great potential and the professor knows what he is talking about however, the Coursera implementation of it is lacking.  It looks like they took his materials from other courses and put it up in somewhat random order.  I.e. talking about things that haven't happened yet in the course timeline as though they have.   Many of the resources have broken links and/or are mismatched with the assignments/topics.  The assignments have very poor definition of the expectations.  In at least one case a practical assignment is duplicated exactly.  The quiz questions generally are good except they often cover topics which haven't been talked about.  If the issues mentioned were fixed, it would move to 4 or 5 stars.  Even with the flaws, I did learn something and hope that I do not find the same flaws in the second course of the four course series.",0,3,Robert Schultz,90485373
16941549~COURSE!~3XEY9ItuEeiIRxKvaAZJ0A,1612943975844,1,0,"This course is horrible!  In the first week, the ""instructor"" provides very little actual information, provides you four of his own projects that you can review all on your own with no guidance.  Oh wait, you can only access own of the projects, the other four are locked away on the university's FTP server.  But don't worry, your frustration isn't over yet, when you attempt to work with the one that is actually available, the instructions are so vague and unclear that you'll spend more time trying to figure out what you're supposed to be doing, and how to submit it in a way that is successful, that you'll have spent more time on that, then listening to the instructor.  Complete waste of time and effort!!",0,2,David Johnson,16941549

I already knew where to find tons of hard to read texts,No credentials to download material needed to pass examsI've wasted countless hours trying to understand what to do.

71506~COURSE!~3XEY9ItuEeiIRxKvaAZJ0A,1644423635206,2,0,"I​ really like the course subject, but this is the most disorganized Coursera class I've ever taken. The lecture videos seem like they were randomly selected from a collection taken over a couple year period -- as such they're very redundant and there's no real continuity between them. Additionally, the quizes don't really seem to cover the lecture material and are out of sync with what is being taught in the current week.T​he peer-graded assignments are just busy work and don't really enforce the course material or give the learner an oppuirtunity to apply what they just learned -- It's just taking some hacky sample code and making a couple modifications to it.T​he professor seems like he really knows his stuff, and this is such important material for people working with hard real time systems to know. As such, it feels like Coursera and the Univeristy of Boulder are doing everyone taking this clas a diservice by puting this material out there in such a hacky way. If someone just took the time to make the lectures and quizes a little more coherent and refined the programming assignments a bit more, this could truly be a wonderful class.",0,14,Brent Miller,71506

Because some of the quizzes cover some points too early, and those points will be mentioned in the future sections one or two weeks later. Also there are some assignments which appears so late, that I thought we should have already finished it up in the previous weeks! (e.g.,Assignment 4 :Pthreads with CPU core affinity in Linux to Emulate AMP, which I think should have been done in Week2 or Week3 already) Other things including the knowledge and skills taught in the lectures are basically quite good, so I will give an total of 5 stars, thanks:)",0,2,michael wang,79692522
