This happened 50 times in an hour, and I had to resize my workspace and rewind the instruction video 50 times and rewatch to catch up. 4 stars for the instructor: She needs to slow the course down slightly and explain what each feature does and what the before and after is so people understand why it is being added and the effect it has. Sometimes it seems that adding things does nothing, so it would help to see what effect adding items does to the Tableau project. ",0,2,Ashish Patel,62538588
