I think the answer choices weren't always clear, but that served to make me think (and you don't need 100% to pass, so a few wrong is good).A​ slight negative was the repetition from video to reading. I'm not a huge fan of video, but in this course, the video was so good and clear, by the end I was skimming the reading because it didn't add enough.M​aybe the reading could be more use cases with specifics, instead of more learning material?",0,3,David Bressler,30810161
