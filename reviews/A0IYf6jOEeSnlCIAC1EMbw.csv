20585996~COURSE!~A0IYf6jOEeSnlCIAC1EMbw,1474845363111,4,0,"Interesting course but:1) The transcripts for each week are appalling. Here is a copied and pasted example: ""Separatist groups remained active in almost 90% of decapitation cases where only a third of ideologically ideological organizations such as left wing and right wing organizations. Are damaged by it. And then, in general, in 17% of the cases. So 7% of the cases, decapitation led to the collapse of an organization."" How are those that are hearing impaired meant to understand what the course leader is communicating? It took me so long to understand the transcript that I may as well have listened instead. The subtitles option reads the same as the transcript - not much good for anyone with anything but perfect hearing.2) The estimated timings for each activity are somewhat optimistic. '10 minutes' is the recommended reading time for each week's reading content. Within this reading list are, on average, 8 articles, some of which amount to over 70 pages - if each article is roughly 25-40 pages on average, and there are around 8 articles, how will this reading activity take the student only '10 minutes' to complete?Apart from that, I did really enjoy the course!!",0,4,Paige Windust,20585996

Some names : Gilles Kepel, Olivier Roy, Mathieu Guideres). Some assumptions about history of terrorism are factually wrong too: Narodnaïa Volia was not an anarchist movement, but a nihilist (Tchernytchevsky, Netchaiev) one. Militants came from russian aristocracy and their ideology was based on the education of the peasant people of russia when anarchists thank that the revolution would come from the workers and the new proletarian class. And anarchy came first from France (Proudhon, Fourier, etc…) and moved after to Russia. Finally, the role of PFLP in the history of terrorism is much more important than PLO (new modus operandi - plane high jacking and hostages, collusion with left-wing AND right wing movements) : of course I don't talk there about political influence but about history of terrorism, movements and modus operandi.Check out the great book ""Histoire du terrorism"" - Gilles Ferragu, Paris, 2014.Anyway i enjoy very much this course.

and Counterterrorism: Comparing Theory and Practice! I have
learned quite a lot from this comprehensive study. It must be said, if the
student is serious about the course, it will take many more hours than
indicated. But is it absolutely worth the time and efforts.Professor Bakker is, amongst others,
promoting different communications with the public in case of a terror attack.
The day after I completed the course, the attack in the Nice cathedral took
place. I would have loved to hear how professor Bakker would evaluate the
communication efforts from the authorities and media. What difference will it
make for instance to team up with local representatives of involved minorities,
when there are global communications about the terror attack? Further, the
study is indeed comprehensive. That for I am puzzled how it is possible that
Iran is totally left out of the equation. Finally, the establishment of the
Caliphate. According to professor Bakker this was already established by IS,
which was looking for a Caliphate in the Levant. I wonder why Professor Bakker
ignores the fact that the ultimate goal is a worldwide Caliphate with Islam the
universal religion. I am sure Professor Bakker has an answer to all these
questions. If not, this review might challenge him to look into these
aspects.",0,0,m. loots,73456473

Professor Bakker's lectures in each of those videos are clear, thorough and deceptively simple.  One realizes in retrospect that Bakker has not only smoothly covered major theoretical issues about terrorism but he has also woven considerable historical detail as well as some academic controversy into the overall narrative.  An important strength is that Dr. Bakker is careful to promote objectivity as he discusses point after point, but he is not shy about offering his opinion, particularly concerning the many controversial matters that come up.  However, he is always entirely candid about his position when he does so, and that candor reinforces the scholarly tenor of the entire course.  This is a valuable entry into a subject of great contemporary relevance, confusion, and need for sound policy-making; it will help to enhance one's ability to come to rational judgments about how terrorism can be understood and responded to.

It is geared to both college-educated people and for those people without previous knowledge course. The course allows different levels of depth; both can be used to acquire general knowledge about terrorism and counterterrorism, to elaborate on specific aspects, because it offers the student a varied and useful bibliography and recommended readings. As far as the platform is concerned, it is very intuitive and easy to handle, even an online course. My feeling has been to meet not only the vastness of the subject, the platform can be part of the course and the ability to communicate through forums with students sharing concerns and seek solutions. It's an easy course to follow although it online because it is well structured and has a good organization. This does not mean that the course is exceeded without hard work, as the estimated 5/6 hours a week of dedication is pretty accurate.It is not the typical course online almost testimonial. You have to work hard if you want to get a good result. So maybe it's the most rewarding thing I have done. From what I have learned and by the possibilities I see this field. It has also been rewarding by Professor Dr. Edwin Baker and his team for their skill and dedication, they have been tremendously didactic.

It's a very interesting course and I love that the professor provides names of important authors in the field, books, films and also schools specialized in studies on terrorism and counterterrorism. I started considering counterterrorism as a career path after my Law degree, we will see how the course will go, but so far (week threem, about to start week four) so good!",0,0,Alessandra Vitale,6071796

Professor Edwin Bakker didactic approach is especially suitable to my ideal concept of how a teacher should communicate with his/her audience. Together with Moral Foundations of Politics held by Professor Ian Shapiro, I would rate these two the most attractive and expectations matching courses I've ever come across online.Thanks to Coursera, Leiden University and all the people who makes this miracle of quality online teaching for free ever possible.Stefano",0,0,stefano calabrese,11044862

The history is an  important aspect ,so having finished the course I feel I have a good overview of where we are and where we are coming from with an acknowledgement of the future. I wasn't sure that I would finish since one of the quizzes was so tricky but I got through it and learnt to revise well for the final exam. The videos are very well presented by Dr. Bakker and guests and the essential and supplementary readings very pertinent and enlarging.I wish I still had access to those materials as I didn't read everything I would have liked to but know I can at least refer to Perspectives on Terrorism online whenever I want to for current articles.",0,0,Lynn-Marie Harper,9076352

222503~COURSE!~A0IYf6jOEeSnlCIAC1EMbw,1442469217913,5,0,"When discussed in popular media, terrorism is a topic that is quite sensationalized. In contrast, Professor Bakker offered a very balanced view of terrorism in this course, tackling common perceptions of terrorism and counterterrorism in an organized fashion, and backing up his claims with arguments from both sides as well as hard data collected by scholars in the field.I also like that the course was kept current with added discussion on Syria. The lectures on Syria were a bit less clear and organized than the previous ones, but then again, hindsight is 20/20, and the Syria conflict is a current event.By and large, I liked that Professor Bakker did not ""preach"" his thoughts on terrorism, e.g. making leaps of faith and then expecting us to take unproven assumptions as the basis for a further argument. If I had to make one suggestion on how to improve the course, I would say that the handful of videos by external speakers were not properly contextualized in the course. In particular, I didn't understand why there was a video of a woman from Amnesty International talking about drone strikes and urging political action, since it was not referenced at all by other lectures.",0,1,Colleen Lee,222503
