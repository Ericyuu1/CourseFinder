The instructions are not clear at times, some answers are mistyped but the worst part is grading expects your code to be written in a particular way, even if it produces the expected results.

82817572~COURSE!~So1rPaCBEeyFDhLpwtOZqw,1666600698588,1,0,"Absolutely terrible. I'm not sure why JavaScript programming is the first module in a Front-end course for BEGINNGERS. It feels like Meta had this JavaScript class from another program and just stuck it in here so they could then teach you React. The JavaScript class feels jumbled, unordered, missing criteria. I have experience with basic HTML and CSS, I'm a UX designer working for a DEEP TECH company where we build microservices and event sourced applications. I have had to dive into some pretty serious topics in my professional life but this course was particularly difficult to grasp. Often, they did not provide reasoning behind WHEN and WHY you would want to use a particular method or an object or a function. They more often than not gave a very vague discription of what it could do while introducing other methods in the code but not giving further explanation.  For example, they'll start coding an example and say ""I'll add the inner text method first, followed by ..."" But the inner text method had never been introduced prior and there was no pause to say what it was or what it could do. I stuck with this for so long because this course, for whatever reason, had really high reviews so I thought I must be missing something. But I think it's because either the programming with JavaScript is part of another program/certificate where it maybe makes more sense? But I don't understand how this is for beginners.

This course was included in my Coursera Plus subscription, so I decided to give it a shot. I'm glad I did because it turned out to be the best course I've taken on Coursera. It was organized, up-to-date, and thorough, without going into the weeds. Given my experience in this course, I decided to start working through the other courses in the front end developer program. For me, front end work has always gotten short thrift while I focused on data work with Python. So, I'm excited by the prospect of adding a lot of new tools to my belt with the larger program and giving front end work the attention it deserves. In any event, well done to the team who put this course together. ",0,0,Matt Barnes,11279859

I immediately adored the brilliance of structure, preparation of lectures, and easy-to-understand information modules.  The lectures are usually very short, so it is easy to follow and concentrate. Moreover, the explanation is understandable even for newbie programmers like me:) I would definitely recommend everyone doing notes throughout the course, since they were a lifesaver for me. It connects your memory to what you are writing down by hand, so I noticed a significant improvement in my knowledge and skills after starting to make notes. They are also convenient during tests and recaps, as you can quickly go through them and revise everything you've learned so far! Definitely worth spending time on!It was a 2nd course from the specialization that I took. I can say that every module is made on the highest level. Even if some challenges arose, I could always look up additional reading linked in the modules to explore the topic even further.Therefore, I would definitely reccomend it to the people, who are seeking to learn basics of JavaScript or to people, who forgot them and just wanted to recap. Definitely will fill all the holes! 😊Additionally, I wanted to spare the gratefullness to Coursera for giving me a financial aid!

The best part is that they teach you how to do testing which is crucial for languages like JavaScript where you are never sure what a piece of code can end up doing.

For successful completion in addition to the video and exersises, you need to use and explore a bunch of sources (what is actually provided by the META staff) by yourself. What I really like is a lot of exercises during the lectures and at the end of each module. Also, I would recommend do not rush and very carefully reading instructions for the tasks to prevent grade issues. The lector speaks with a little Scottish accent, but very clearly. Kudos to META!",0,6,Dzyanis Sukhanitski,9440129

The video and Instruction thoroughly explain all the concepts you need to know at a pacing that anyone could follow regardless if they have a background in programming already or if they're new. It never assumes you already know something and expects you to pretty much only do exactly what they demonstrate for you. ",0,11,Michael,91002716
