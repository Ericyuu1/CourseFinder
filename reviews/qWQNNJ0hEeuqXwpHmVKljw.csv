49686345~COURSE!~qWQNNJ0hEeuqXwpHmVKljw,1677482038706,2,0,ラボ課題で「間違いが含まれるソースコードをノーヒントで修正する」という内容が多いが、・出題者による誘導が致命的に下手で、意図が全く理解できない・主題のGPUプログラミングと関係ない、ただのケアレスミスの修正・教材全般にナチュラルにケアレスミスが多いので、課題なのかただのミスなのか分からない唯一の救いは、ほとんど理解できないままある程度までエラーを潰せば合格点には達することができることだが、肝心のGPUプログラミングの勉強にはほとんど役に立たない。とにかく課題がお粗末すぎる。何も考えられていない。気持ち的には1つ星だが、スタックはしなかったので2つ星にしておく。,0,0,Yukihiro Fujita,49686345

It is abundantly clear that quality was not a first order concern when this course was created. You'll get significantly more correct information perusing other CUDA learning resources.That said, the course has one saving grace and that is that for labs and assignments you get access to Coursera's hosted programming environments which in this case include a GPU instance that you can use to learn on your own. Those hosted environments work really well - kudos to the Rhyme team for that!",0,0,Artur Klauser,6525587

Although I have dabbled with it in the past - learning on my own - a structured course introduced me to areas such as using the different types of memory effectively.However, I found the course very trying at times.  First, some of the lessons appear out of order in the overview window on the left.  On several occasions, discussion of a programming assignment appeared AFTER the programming assignment.  If you take this course, watch out for that.  Sometimes, the discussions are useful.My second major criticism is in the content of the lessons themselves.  On very few occasions is there any discussion of the objective of the programming assignment.  Not only does one have to figure out how to do the assignment, one has to figure surmise the objective of the assignment, i.e., ""what is this program supposed to do?"".  This is not clear at all in may cases.  Obviously, one can figure all this out after some very unnecessary frustration - I did - but it's so unnecessary and should not be a factor in a course offered by a major institution such as Johns Hopkins.Finally, I saw very little attention from the teacher or an assistant to questions that appeared in the discussion forums.  The teacher answered a couple of questions, but most go unanswered.  From the sparsity of the discussions, I suspect that very few people take this course.I'm going to look around for other sources of training before continuing with the other two courses.  If I can find it elsewhere, I will certainly go there first.",0,0,David Humphrey,1103627
