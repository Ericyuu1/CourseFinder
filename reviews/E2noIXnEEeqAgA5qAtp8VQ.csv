Sometimes you round up, sometimes you round down, but it is inconsistent.    You might have the ""right"" answer, but you wont know because you are entering it in the wrong format.  The last two questions of week 4 are terrible.   It would be nice if there was s single ZIP file of all of the reading material.  Downloading the optional material in week 5 is just way more work than it should be.  *HERE IS A TIP* - do the first two weeks of the Introduction to Corporate Finance by Michaels Robert BEFORE you do this course.  His explanations are much easier to understand.  It will help you to understand *some* of the material in this course.  That course explains all of its concepts so much better.  It's just night and day.  Then to see what is *really* possible with online instruction,  go over to Marginal Revolution University and take their Intro to Micro course.   Their instructional material is amazing.   Every online course should teach as well as MRU.  HERE IS ONE MORE TIP...when you are taking the quizzes...Submit your quiz *one answer at a time*.  And then write down your correct answers in your own answer key in a word or excel document. Otherwise, you may not remember what your answer was when you inevitably re take the quiz. When you know you have all the right answers, enter them all at once, and then submit a final time.  it's not worth filling out each answer every time you re submit the quiz.  just do the quiz one questions at a time until you are ready to submit all of the answers at once.

Those with no background may find the course moves intensely into math and formulas and applying them. I also have limited background in Finance, but I did take the course ""Introduction to Corporate Finance"" before this course which made it easier for me to move along this course. So I recommend those who finds this course difficult to take ""Introduction to Corporate Finance"" first.Having said that, I actually like the fact that this course focuses both on applying the concepts and formulas to understand finance as well as focuses on the math part as to how the formulas come about. Understanding, how finance formulas are formed helps me understand the concept more deeply. I also  liked that this course use less multiple choices in tests, but rather type in the answer (numeric value), as it makes students try harder to come up with the answer.The professor explains subjects well. The way the content and flow of the course is designed is superb.Also, I do not see any problems or bugs or mistakes with the four quizzes. All of them has correct answers.
