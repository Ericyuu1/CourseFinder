4801135~COURSE!~3MCHSol2EeaHnhLSF3DHOw,1637645113291,1,0,"T​his course is obviously home-made. Why the University of Minnesota permitted it to be uploaded to the Coursera platform is something I cannot fathom; it is by far the shabbiest course I have ever reviewed at Coursera. All topics presented are covered much more effectively in other courses. For example, SVD is covered by Nathan Kutz on his youtube AMATH channel, with applications. The economics of MOOCs is still a bit mysterious to me, but both Coursera and UMinn must financially benefit in at least some small way by having this content here, but why rely on Daniel Boley when we have Gilbert Strang, Nathan Kutz, Grant Sanderson, and many more teachers who actually care about imparting knowledge. If you look at his CV, Boley is research-oriented and obviously no longer cares a whit for teaching at this level. What we get is a review and a rather spotty one, at that, aimed at on-campus students in some other area at UMinn itself who have already mastered the topic.",0,0,Daniel Stein,4801135

There are issues with the practice quizzes that were pointed out in the discussion forum months ago for which there is still no reply. Staff should at least glance at the forum to see if there are any problems with the course material.
