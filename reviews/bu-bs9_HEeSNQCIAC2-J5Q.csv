However, the course is strewn with small errors and mistakes, which did surprise me as I found myself quite often confused about something only to realize it was a mistake on their part. The other aspect that seriously lacks from this course is the communication with the ""instructors"". I say this because the videos were clearly filmed a while back and the content is not updated. Questions and doubts take several days to get answered and it just seems quite lazy in all honesty. In addition to this, none of the exams/tests are looked at by the instructors, not even the final exam, which is in fact marked by other students. So although the content is rich and well explained, it does not really feel like an active course, rather a series of YouTube videos with a few questions added in.

It started off with ""here are two notes on the staff"" in week 1 to ""here is the third inversion of secondary dominant in relative minor"" in week five. Here are my thoughts on the course:I originally wanted to give only three stars- for Richard, Zack and Nikki. I felt like they were really good teachers compared to the others who taught using examples. Even the reading material was good.As time went by, the reading material were just links to wikipedia and musictheory which I didn't expect from the University of Edinburgh. Still I must say this was kinda like a boon because those links were very helpful, even more so than some of the lecture videos.I felt like some concepts in the quiz weren't taught in the sessions (such as counting unequal note values within tuplets etc) Also week 3 could have been handled much much better, with lots of practical examples to make learning the theory even more efficientI don't mind the challenging quizzes, I would like to say if you're clear with the concepts and try to understand what the question is about, it is easy to score 100 in all the quizzes...even week 5. I understand the beginner's frustrations with this though. Please add feedback to all the other quizzes from week 1. Only week 1 had actual feedback, where we were told where we went wrong in the quiz.Speaking of week 5, that took a lot of time for me because of the clearly not so beginner content and the pace. I might suggest better positioning of the camera, maybe a top view instead of a side view so we can clearly see what is being played,I understand that its typical of universities to not spoon-feed everything, and to encourage us to go and explore the subject some more. At many points, I felt discouraged though. However I'm happy to say I eventually used multiple sources, and was able to finish the final exam which I did very well.

I saw 'fundamentals of music theory', free of charge, and thought it would be a good place to start. A word of advice: this is certainly not for beginner musicians.My only criticism of the course would be that the end of unit quizzes, and final exam, are a VERY steep climb from the comparatively pedestrian level of instruction (barring the rhythm section, which required a lot of further study to get my head around). The formula seems to go: crawl (teach concept), baby steps (watch demonstration of concept), Olympic 100-metre sprint (answer university level questions).

You can take end of unit quizzes as many times as you would like, meaning the challenge just about meets the pace of learning.I am thoroughly pleased with the time I put into this course, and I am excited to go back to my instruments (saxophone and guitar) armed with a greater understanding of these fundamentals, and indeed more complex concepts, of music theory.

46270610~COURSE!~bu-bs9_HEeSNQCIAC2-J5Q,1589323031655,5,0,"I came into this course as a lifelong musician (more than forty years experience)  with limited knowledge of theory. I came into this course with a thirst to learn, understanding that I would be challenged because the course description explained that it would offer something for everyone, beginner or advanced. The course did not disappoint in this regard. While I did find week three extremely frustrating, I did take the instructor's references and search the online world for sites that would help me learn, more thoroughly, the concepts. Now I have a bookmark library filled with sites that will help me continue on my journey to learning theory and the Fundamentals of Music Theory was a great starting point. My advice for those who consider taking this course is for you to enter with an understanding that this is an inexpensive (or free to some maybe), non-credit course that looks at music theory in six short weeks. Don't expect to have every little detail expanded upon with hours of exercises. That you are enrolling in an online course means you already understand that the onus will be on you to seek out the knowledge you need to pass this course. I also suggest that you frequent the forums each week and take part in active discussions around the concepts you are learning. Thanks to this course, I have learned more about theory in the short time I spent in this course than I have in the forty plus years I've been gigging. I will definitely take more courses around music theory.

This knowledge has given me immense appreciation for composers of music and for the musicians who transform an intellectual art into performances that others can enjoy.  The lecturers packed a great deal into their videos, and all of them were not just wonderful, but they complemented each other.  I especially loved how Zack Moir and Nikki Moran taught together--one just doesn't want to let them down!--and particular thanks must go to Zack, whose 'electronic blackboard' video, ""Modulations II ""during Week 5, provided just the extra boost many learners probably needed to master some very difficult material.

The order in which the material is given is also thought of.Everything in this course is considered, thought of, and given a big value.One can get the course for free or pay (very cheap compared to its high level) to get the certificate of completing it. There's only one thing that you need to keep in mind, in the non-paid (free) option, the materials cannot be viewed backwards after completing the section/week (only the first week remains available). So when I completed week #2, quickly, and passed the test, then proceeded to week #3, I couldn't go back to week #2 to view some things I wanted to re-read for deeper understanding.Thank you very much for the free content you give, for the beautiful way it is given. All the instructors are great. I am very grateful. I have completed 2.5 weeks in a matter of few days only, and I am very excited to continue.
