45877786~COURSE!~26_hjkfLEeiCFArE3fR-sA,1675306483757,3,0,"I think this course does a good job in trying to be comprehensive and provide some amount of coverage for many relevant topics to genomics in medicine (or ""precision"" medicine).If I have a chance to revise my review, then I might change this to be 4 stars instead of 3 stars.However, my reasoning for giving 3 stars is follows: - There are a number of typos.  I also have a tendency to make typos, and I reported many (but not all) of what I noticed through the system to report issues.  So, if those are fixed, then I hope that helps future students. - While I can understand the motivation to avoid inflating grades by re-taking quizzes too many times, there was a fairly large number of questions where I was not sure why I did not get the 100% graded option.  To be fair, this was not so bad that I risked not passing the class.  However, I don't think it was ideal for learning purposes. - I took the course both to refine my knowledge as well as try out courses to potentially recommend to others (where I am a Bioinformatics Specialist working in genomics research for my main job).  If there was only 1 or 2 points where I was not sure if I agreed with the conclusion, then I could try having a discussion to either see what I misunderstood or possibly describe the issue better (or both).  However, I think there was a noticeable amount of time when I was not sure if I completely agreed, and the difficulty in finding the ""correct"" answers when multiple options were provided per question made that harder.  To be fair, I definitely agreed with conclusions much more than I disagreed with conclusions, and I think many core concepts were covered well.  However, at the moment, I think I would first like to try out some additional courses before returning for additional discussions (and then possibly revising my review, if that is possible).",0,0,Charles Warden,45877786
