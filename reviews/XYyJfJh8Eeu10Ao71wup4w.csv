I will try to finish this course but not sure if this is going to happen.Just small improvements like more dynamic and charismatic lecturer would make this course a great experience ;),0,0,Ola Zabrocka,50195769
4922153~COURSE!~XYyJfJh8Eeu10Ao71wup4w,1669726492310,2,0,Concepts were simple and should have been delivered in a more compact way. Presentation accompanying voiceover was not content rich.No presentation slides to download. Major concepts could be captured in a simple (ideally downloadable) table for use during the tests. I didn't want to progress with the specialization after taking the first course ,0,0,Rashid Ejaz,4922153

The lecturer should try to put in the lectures some more passion and involvement.",0,0,Daniele Rozzoni,37573183

Some parts were very repetitive; for example, the video titled More Multimodal Considerations in Week 3 almost entirely repeats information from the previous video about biking, congestion fees, and shared vehicles. Also, the quiz questions are badly proofread and some answers are incorrect (for example, the answers to question 14 and 16 of the quiz for week 4 are incorrect). ",0,0,Emily Manson,35459358
