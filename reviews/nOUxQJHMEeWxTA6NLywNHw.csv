I'm a professional engineer with a Master's degree and this course takes some beating for technical difficulty.  Of course, it's not impossible, but there's an assumption of a high degree of knowledge before you start. Do not attempt this courses unless you already have an understanding of calculus at an advanced undergradute level. The course materials skim quickly over the theory in the assumption that you already understand the mathematics. To make it even harder, there is no guidance whatsoever as to how to complete the assignments. You have to work it all out by yourself, which is no mean feat. The feedback tells you what you got wrong, but gives no clues as to how to get tothe correct answer. And just to make it interesting, I'm fairly sure there's a few errors in there too.  It's challenging, one of the most challenging courses I've completed since graduating, but all in all, you have to learn and understand this course to pass.  There are no short cuts. You should also be able to use Matlab, Octave or a similar programming language (a few students noted they didn't have this knowledge and they were finding it impossible to proceed).  An advanced excel user might just be able to make it,One more thing, the time estimates are very ambitious. If you don't know the material already, it's probably going to take you a lot longer than they suggest.In conclusion, if want to know this subject better go for it!

No hints, no answers in the lectures, and no help in the forums, apart from the fellow students as annoyed as myself. All that made me end up simply trying out all possible combinations (and that with multiple ticks makes no less than 31 combinations - hi, combinatorics! - and 3 tries in 8 hours), which is clearly not the way I would like to spend my youth. Also there are some maths typos in the slides in some lectures that make it difficult to get into the subject, and I'm almost sure that some of the answers in one of the last quizzes are wrong - but no way to figure it out, since no feedback is provided anyway. So my resolution is that the contents of the course are quite good and well-organised for a motivated beginner, but the moderation is the aspect that should be looked upon for sure.",0,1,Aleksandra Visich,15814204

The course is really interesting and the lectures and lecturers are great. It is insightful and provides basic knowledge mainly oriented to the assessment of wind power availability. If you seek a more turbine oriented approach (aerodynamics, turbine manufacturing and etc), this is not a good option. Great problem, in my opinion: evaluation system is very poor. Many items are not well formulated and it's hard to understand your mistakes after failing a test try. It became so uncomfortable that led me to only giving 3 stars. In summary, I would recommend this course to all who want a basic introduction to the field of wind energy. Take it up a as a listener and avoid a lot of stress.
