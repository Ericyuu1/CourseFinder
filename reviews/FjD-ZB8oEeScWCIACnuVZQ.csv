On one end it tells you how good and well prepared are the lesson, which are definitely reflecting the Qualifications of the instructors. I definitive appreciated the way the lesson were being conducted, the assessment method including the additional resources for reading.
On the other hand, I felt as if instructors were absent in the forum discussion, it could be due to the period I am taking the lesson, maybe the course is overdue and the instructors are no longer there. Also, I saw students sharing the answers for the quiz, that in my opinion it is never good for the students.
All in all, I am delighted to have completed this useful course and I am sure it will help me in my carrier. I recommend you to keep supporting us as usual so that health problems can be well addressed in mid long term, especially in underdeveloped countries such as Mozabique, my country.
