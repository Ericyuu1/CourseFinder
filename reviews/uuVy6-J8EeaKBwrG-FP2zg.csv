This professor is definitely one of the better professors I've ever seen lecture.  He's very good, engages with the students well asking conceptual questions and clarifying misunderstandings, and generally explains the concepts well.I have a couple minor complaints.  First, the professor made a couple mathematical statements that are strictly wrong.  I do not mean he made an error in adding numbers together or anything like that, but he made claims about things like eigenvectors that are just wrong.  I also think his mathematical notation is pretty terrible in a few places and I would absolutely not accept his notation if he submitted a paper to a journal I was reviewing.My other main complaint is that I feel like I mostly just learned the basic ideas about attitude dynamics in this course and then learned how to plug numbers into equations.  I didn't actually learn really how to problem solve.  This class is teaching you how to be a generic black box engineer.  In all my work at the CU Boulder applied math department I felt like I learned how to solve problems and the work was more challenging.  In this course you generally get an equation and just plug numbers in and get the answer.  I didn't feel like I learned as much as I wanted to in the end.Still, a very good professor and fairly well taught course.  I just wish I would have learned a bit more.",0,1,Tracy Babb,44783046

I was expecting a bit more activity with the mentorship and some QNA, but all of the cross-checkings of work are between classmates (so it could be the case of the blind leading the blind really...) and we are pretty much left alone.

You can learn a huge amount of mathematics and applications in classical mechanics on these 4 weeks, which is crucial for me as a physicist, and there are a lot of challenging exercises so you can fully understand this. The only (for my point of view) disadvantage of this course is that in the last week you need to use/learn some programming skilles which I was not interested in learning (I only wanted to study the physics and math of this course even if programming is also useful in the field of physics).

I am working as an engineer in the space industry already, and took this course to patch up some cloudy areas of understanding. I got quite the bang for my buck.The material is taught in a style that leans towards applicable theory for the well-educated engineer. The videos are recordings of in-classroom lectures from UC Boulder, a university know for it's tight history of collaboration with NASA everywhere from Mars to Earth's outer Magnetosphere. In this course you will cover the necessary engineering physics to describe orbiting and rotating reference frames, attitude coordinate systems, and methods for determining spacecraft attitude from on-board sensors.My educational background is from outside an aerospace engineering department, and I had no problem keeping up. I encourage not only aerospace engineers, but anyone working in space (scientists, programmers, operations personnel) to try this course.",0,4,Daniel da Silva,12731146

His lectures provide valuable and clear insights into the concepts at play. The assignments are thorough and engaging as well.

Prof Schaub does an excellent job of filling in the gaps in the text and making it more understandable, but it does really, really help to have the book to work through along with the class. Even with a background in physics, math, and engineering, I immediately learned something new about how to solve kinematics problems that I should have known but didn't. The concept of generalized/canonical coordinate systems never made sense to me until this class, where for some reason the explanation just clicked and I knew how it worked like flipping a switch. That knowledge alone was worth the price of the certificate. Continuing on to work the follow-on courses and perhaps complete the specialization.",0,2,Brian Page,22678534
