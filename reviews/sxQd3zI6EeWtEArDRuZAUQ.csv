He assumes we know every thing before hand, database, server etc. He just has basic concepts in his lecture classes while intermediate level implementations of it in different languages. He just instructs check out this tutorial online and do this assignment. If you are already familiar with all the languages and software platforms that he is using than you can go ahead with the course or you will end up like me where you will have to take up different courses to just complete assignments of this one.",0,1,Piyush Kumar,27705046

5843310~COURSE!~sxQd3zI6EeWtEArDRuZAUQ,1466546661141,1,0,"I'll say the same about this class as the rest of the specialization, if you have the skills to complete this course then you don't need to take this course.  If you don't have the skills to complete this course, you will not complete this course.  The course instruction is at 10000 feet level and the assignments are very challenging and the course will NOT teach you the skills required to complete the assignments.  The AWS final assignment is a very much throw you into the deep end with no real instruction (well at least completely outdated instructions) and will expect you to swim (or more likely for most people, to drown). I recommend the Machine Learning Course (from Bill's colleagues) at University of Washington.  That is a course where you get some real instruction and understanding of how to complete assignments (though still very challenging).  ",0,0,Andre Johnson,5843310

It's flat out exploitative to throw students at an AWS assignment without updated instructions and with outdated versions of pig scripts, etc. They're setting students up to hemorrhage money on AWS and possibly not get anything out of it.
