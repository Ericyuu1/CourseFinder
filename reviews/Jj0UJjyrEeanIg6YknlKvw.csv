452912~COURSE!~Jj0UJjyrEeanIg6YknlKvw,1605213418475,1,0,"This course is great, but the specialization is not. When you get to the last course, the Capstone, it is designed in a way that you can not complete it. You have to use another website and you can't work without fellow students, but the students do not show up. Worse yet, the teacher assistants do not answer any of the requests for help. This specialization is designed so that students can not finish. ",0,6,Brenda L B,452912
29684960~COURSE!~Jj0UJjyrEeanIg6YknlKvw,1567786743140,2,0,"The course (the set of 4 courses) started out SO good. The pace was quick, content and format engaging, and it showed you from the perspective of ""hey, this is what we are looking at in real life, here are the pros and cons to look for, etc"". It was great! By course 3 it was getting so bogged down with BLAH BLAH BLAH that I could hardly see straight. Suddenly we went from engaging content to mind-numbing boredom. The kind where keeping your eyes open, or even clicking that 'next video' link, was enough to set your whole body into a rigor mortis of NOOOOOOOOOOO. : (  Which is really disappointing because UI/UX is interesting!! Basically this went from hands on tech-vocational training to the doldrums of a standard school format (which is proven ineffective and doesn't give you the skills you need - you have to learn those AFTER you complete the schooling)The videos just seemed to go on and on in this way. I lost all concept of gaining knowledge and it became a marathon of trying to inch my way forward and to hit the finish line. I don't understand how we went from such a strong start to what came after. Course 1 was the best. I was really excited about everything. Then over time it's like the content just sort of got left to drift and fall flat and not just be TO-THE-POINT. Overall some of the content was still A+ but just lost in the way content was approached/delivered. I truly believe this could be fixed and the course could be stellar throughout.",0,9,Kris M,29684960
