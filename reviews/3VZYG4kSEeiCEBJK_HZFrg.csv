32004271~COURSE!~3VZYG4kSEeiCEBJK_HZFrg,1561836677057,2,0,"Peer review system HAS TO CHANGE, IT IS VERY POOR currently - As I type this review, I am waiting for my assignment review for around a weeks time now, no luck in getting any feedback no matter how many threads you make or post in discussion forums like mentioned in FAQs. This peer review system of having 3 reviews to complete the course has to change to 1 peer review for completion of the course. There is no point in making a learner wait for 7-10 days time without providing any kind of feedback. I put the same comment for Course 2 & I am iterating the same comment/suggestion once again in course 3.",0,3,surendar ramamoorthy,32004271
