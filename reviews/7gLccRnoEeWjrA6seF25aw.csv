I don't have anything against that company, but business and learning are 2 very different things. The link with Microstrategy seems to have led to lazyness : so many low-effort contents (assignments directly taken out of the Microstrategy website, poor structure of shared documents, etc.), endless auto-promotion of the book of the teacher. I really felt like the CEO of Microstrategy was kind enough to share with me his views on BI (which might be the goal of Microstrategy with their partnership with the university). I am not happy having paid for this. The other courses of the specialization are great though. Please remove and rework this particular Course 4 from the specialization.",0,3,Olivier Risack,31320004

The Oracle VM is not used at all through the whole course and is required for the next Course in the program.For the Business Intelligence and data visualisation, we are required to use Microstrategy, which is a pain to install. You need a corporate or student email to register in order to download the program. And any technical support for the software is behind this corporate account login you need. If you don't have a corp/school email you can use another version shared by the staff but good luck getting technical support and there are no external forums or support platforms at all. Why not use a more-widely used BI software, like Microsoft Power BI where we can go online if we have any technical issues or to find documentation?T​he lectures also do not go into enough detail on BI usage and skills. The videos are really superficial; not enough time is spend on the whole data gathering - cleaning - report building processes, or what type of visuals to use for each kind of data, or any type of general knowledge every BI professional should know. Sure, there are loads (seriously, loads) of external links shared after each lecture, but why am I taking this course if I can just go and read some external material?I​n short, this course felt like it was put together just in a week, 7 years ago, and since then nobody bothered to update it based on the student feedback.

First of all, the teacher has a very difficult accent to follow, which wouldn't be so bad if at least the closed captions were accurate themselves. Second, the material taught feels very generic and theoretical, without a single good example to give them some context. The addtitional material and lecture notes feel very dated too, which is evident as the field of Business Intelligence has rapidly evolved over the decade. Finally, learning MicroStrategy is probably the only good outcome of taking this course, but even so there are quite detailed free tutorials in the web that could do that.

Anyone with basic IT background would be comfortable with the course. Learned various concepts of Business Intelligence; and microstrategy as a BI tool is good for analyzing. After I am done, I am going to spend more time looking at other tools of Microstrategy and apply those in the capstone course if required. I came across some students facing issues with microstrategy in the Discussion forum but I think improper installation or hardware and software support could be the cause.
