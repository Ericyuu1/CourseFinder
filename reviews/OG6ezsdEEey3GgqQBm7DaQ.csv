42274279~COURSE!~OG6ezsdEEey3GgqQBm7DaQ,1675882807878,1,0,"From the first course, this specialization's curriculum degrades in both information value and instructional competence. The assignments are incomplete and confusing, the material is haphazardly assembled and terribly explained. It gave me an excuse to learn Figma, which seems great, but I think I would have gotten just as much out of their tutorials and documentation. ",0,1,Thomas McManus,42274279

116211075~COURSE!~OG6ezsdEEey3GgqQBm7DaQ,1675232974270,1,0,"The course focuses on inane minutia that have no practical use other than to pass the quizzes.

6280560~COURSE!~OG6ezsdEEey3GgqQBm7DaQ,1673855106167,3,0,"A very easy course that I'd imagine most technically minded people will sail through. Greater challenges lie within the other courses in the Certificate program. Ironically I found that the course delivery was inadequate from a UX perspective - maybe more down to Coursera platform limitations but nonetheless something that Meta would probably want to consider for next iteration.
The course is also held back by Peer Review which is too long and people either start nit-picking, or they don't care at all and give full points. Either way, that isn't rewarding.",0,1,james hamilton,6280560

It contains a lot of theory content on usability, design, and interactivity that I wasn't expecting but I found more enjoyable than the other parts of design like lines, depth, color, typefaces, etc. I took this course and the whole specialization because ""Interfaces are Important"", and I learned all the key parts of how and what to render but never the ""why"" behind it all.
