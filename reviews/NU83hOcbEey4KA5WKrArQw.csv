2897896~COURSE!~NU83hOcbEey4KA5WKrArQw,1674929236279,4,0,"Good course for the beginners. However, my only complaint is the video/audio quality of Week 3 and Week 4 is horrible. I didn't like Week 3 because it is repetitive and no real information is provided. The best information is available in Week 1, 2 and 4. I would recommend anyone aspiring to be a power systems engineer to take this course. Again, I would not characterize this course as interdemiate and wouldn't require previous engineering knowledge just the aspiration to learn more will be sufficient. ",0,0,Noaman Rasul,2897896
