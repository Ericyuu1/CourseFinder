The quality is very high.My only discrepancies are about the materil quality which is has not been reviewed with some errors. The thing I have no liked at all is that the ""optional assestment"" is not actually optional and we have to do it so we can pass the assestments. But in general, I am very happy with this course and I highly recommend it. ",0,0,Victor Corral Alonso,100349674
