18228502~COURSE!~H10rxZj0EeW5gxKDBxYMJw,1491239922106,1,0,"This course starts off interesting and then just gets absurd. A huge chunk of the genetic part has activities where you have to translate large genetic sequences by hand. If you don't have access to a printer, trying to break up genetic codes into 3-letter codons and translating them is an exercise in frustration. Plus the sequences are not even easily formatted for printing as they are all images so you can't even just copy them into an editor and break up the sequences.This was only the second course I dropped on Cousera.",0,2,Cliff Stamp,18228502

This is by some margin as well.It's not that it's a really bad course, it's just it really not structured very well and does not flow. The course content is not explained in fine enough detail.There are links to resources in the graded exams because, apparently, the place to learn information is not in the lectures but when taking the actual exams.",0,0,matthew symes,4934977

4935370~COURSE!~H10rxZj0EeW5gxKDBxYMJw,1503674383351,3,0,"As a whole, this was a decent course; the supplemental materials and discussion forums were very helpful. However, I feel as if the information presented through the videos was very general and somewhat jumbled. Also, the gene coding exercises, while mildly interesting, were incredibly tedious to do. In short, work on adding more challenging/factual information to this course and refining your exercises from tedious to engaging, challenging, and/or interesting. ",0,0,Lily Aster Newton,4935370
3634345~COURSE!~H10rxZj0EeW5gxKDBxYMJw,1589480905458,4,0,"I liked the content in the course and how it progresses from fairly easy to sometimes quite hard to understand/ comprehend it all. I believe I sometimes missed some (maybe common) knowledge concerning the subject; especially later in the course where we went to quite different, yet interesting subjects rather quickly. I would like to delve more in the subject in order to comprehend it all though, which is a good thing. I definitely liked the class of the Stanford professor. In online education (in in real-life face to face classes) you sometimes miss a passionate teacher that is capable of explaining the material in such a way that the student gets passionate about the subject as well. The only downside is that it's to easy to upgrade your overall grade because you can immediately retry the tests. With not that many answer options available it's hard to not get the required grade when you make the test a second time. But then again, it's not all about testing of course. I feel like I learned a lot on the subject and this makes me a richer person than before. So thanks to the staff of the Leiden University for putting their efforts in creating this course. I'm thinking of purchasing a certificate, not just as kind of a confirmation for me completing the course, but as also as a big thank you (Coursera as well) for making this knowledge available for everyone on this planet (wit a computer or pc and internet that is).
