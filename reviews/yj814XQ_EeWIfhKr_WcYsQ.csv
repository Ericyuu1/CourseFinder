5962028~COURSE!~yj814XQ_EeWIfhKr_WcYsQ,1628524453507,5,0,"A lot to inhale in a week or so, but very worth it.  Hadn't taken any dinosaur course previously, so initially some of the terminology took some energy to assimilate.  The course notes were worthy of far more attention than just the 10 or so minutes budgeted; I think they are given short shrift if read only cursorily.  I would, however, recommend another editing pass to clear up the odd typo and grammar glitch to kick them up a notch and bring them to the same high quality as the videos.There's good parallelism between the notes and the videos.  The videos are thus very reinforcing of the notes, and vice versa.  At times, it felt like trying to swallow a torrent of information - but my mindset was to remember everything said.  That's not necessary; perhaps the greatest value of the course is the general sense of the flow of Theropod evolution, and of the diverse mechanics of evolution overall, revealed in that general sense.As for content, at the course start I felt like my mind was an empty closet, and the facts were just being thrown in, onto a pile on the floor in the hope that later a coherent vision would emerge; at this point, I feel like the closet now has hooks and hangers and drawers by which those facts can be organized into that coherent collection.  That's a very satisfying feeling, and encourages further exploration - which is one of the measures of a great course: engendering the desire to learn more.On a practical level, the development of the understanding of dinosaur evolution as it evolved in the scientific community over time is a great reminder that science is rarely ""settled,"" but rather is an exercise of trying to draw a detailed picture of a complex ship when you can only see parts of it through occasional openings in the fog, in little glimpses.  Missteps and misinterpretations that need later correcting are intermingled with ongoing debates about what we are seeing and what it means.  Scientists need always to be ready to throw out their most dearly-held beliefs in the face of new data - one of the hardest mental and emotional challenges we have to face in the search for truth.  That's a pretty practical value to have reinforced by a course on dinosaurs - equally applicable to many aspects of life.Finally, and with gratitude, I appreciate not only Coursera for making this available, but the people at University of Alberta for the major effort it took to put this course together, synthesizing and editing down the information into a nicely, well-rounded compendium that told an interesting and imagination-capturing story.  Dinosaurs are one of the superstar interest areas in paleontology - captivating because of their amazing diversity and extreme size, as is obvious from their penetration so widely into the entertainment world.  More than just their ability to hold our fascination, however, they are a gateway to interest in a broader study of life's diversity and origins, as well as a deeper respect for nature.That's a good thing.",0,0,George H.

It is amazing that dinosaur still exist, the modern birds. The topic about theropod and origins of birds interests me. I figured out that birds are the only theropods with better physiology and adaptations. I don't need to revive those extinct dinosaurs, because in farms, forest, savanna, bird shop, park, city, Antartica, and all around the world, dinosaurs living among the mammals and other animals. There is another fact based on Molecular evidence, seven collagen types obtained from T rex's leg bone fragments, compared to collagen data from living birds (specifically, a chicken), suggest that older theropods and birds are closely related. And when you look at all the birds' legs, cooked or uncooked, they're still scaly like the dinosaur and their other relatives, the crocodilians.In 2017, a study found that a peptide was present in the bone of the modern ostrich that was identical to that found in the Tyrannosaurus and Brachylophosaurus specimens. AND LIKE I SAID, you don't need to revive the dinosaurs, because they are still surround us. I am a dinosaur lover. I even dreamed to have a Canary, pet finch bird, and budgerigar as a cheap dinosaur companion in my house, although dad doesn't agree with that.One thing that I am still curious about is, if the birds are dinosaurs just like the non avian theropods, why the hip bone shape or structure of the birds are different than the non avian theropods' hip bones (saurischian hip bone). Which is why I hope Alberta University do more research abouth this",0,0,Djalu Ahmad Yudhistira,62509314

Because I have never paid any attention to dinosaurs from the Mesozoic, and din't have a clue about the variety and naming conventions, I was initially overwhelmed by all the 15+ (seemed like 100+) character long names that were tossed about like popcorn tossed at the villan in a melodrama.  It took a while, but I adjusted.  Beware if you are not a dino connisseur.  While the course offers a primer in bird anatomy at the very beginning, the more you know about modern bird anatomy the better you will see the convulted map of evolution (and where you are heading) from the outset.  My knowledge of bird anatomy was a helpful counter balance to my ignorance of Mesozoic dinos!

I like to make notes and highlight as I watch and it took a lot of page jumping to do that. At the same time I am uncertain if the notes were supposed to be done this way, or worked through after the course. I look forward to other courses by this University as this one was absolutely fantastic! I would love to see a course that goes more into detail on modern bird evolution and adaptions, the last lesson felt very rushed. I would also love to see courses covering other prehistoric species, perhaps the evolution of cats, whales etc or other dinosaur clades.The instructors were a joy to listen to and easily understood too.

He speaks clearly and articulates himself in such a way that he can explain a complex subject in an easy-to-understand way. He doesn't speak too quickly nor too slowly. If anyone wants to be a better presenter, they should follow the example of Persons.I like the questions being asked during the video. Sometimes they are just to make sure you are paying attention, but most times they require you to make inferences based on what you have learned, which is great. If you complete the reading material before watching the videos, you should have no problem at all answering the video questions.The reading material is extremely in-depth and very informative even beyond what the videos offer. One complaint I have would be that the estimated time of completion for the reading is inaccurate. They say it takes about 10 minutes but if you want to actually read and get a good grasp of all of the material presented in the notes, it will take far longer. Personally, it takes me several hours to consolidate the material in my head and to take notes. Like I said, the reading goes very in-depth.The reading material also uses anatomical terms of location very frequently. I would recommend learning the anatomical terms of location (rostral, caudal, distal, proximal, etc.) to assist you while you read the notes. Also take some time to learn how to interpret cladograms. One thing that stands out to me is the Tree of Life, which is basically an interactive learning objective that shows how ALL life to have ever existed on this planet is connected. It is an AMAZING supplement to the course and a lot of fun to explore.
