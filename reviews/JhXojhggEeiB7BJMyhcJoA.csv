Another drawback was that the graphs in the videos were blurry and one could only read the designations on the x and y axes by referring to the slides separately, which was distracting.  I kept moving through the course, determined to finish it and evaluate the concepts that were being discussed, but it was very disorienting to follow the formulae and try to glean their import as related to the concept being discussed. I passed the quizzes by keeping a list of the correct answers for each attempt (many of which I chose at random) and finally passing by the process of elimination.

How to find the median? How to distinguish dependent variables from independent variables?  What is  a sample? What is a category? What is replacement for a draw? When should be replacement? I think the instructor assumed every student here is a Stanford student or an American student.To be honest, this course is not supportive to students because it doesn't open the discussion forum for students to discuss the problems coming from the materials and correct the incorrect calculation in the instruction.  In addition, there is not any handout to  help students  to summarize what are taught in the module or give more examples. Only quizzes, but no exercises.
