There is a sense that the field is new which is, I suppose, as exciting as it is frustrating.  The fourth module presented by Prof. Vasu Reddy is the most engaging presentation I have seen in online education.  Her short lectures are fresh and exciting and her keen scholarship is informed by a great breadth of compassion and a natural instinct for inclusion.  It is worth taking the course for this alone. I found some of the other material rather dry but that, I feel, may be a matter of taste.  The course is well structured and a useful insight into some of the thinking in an important and pioneering field of investigation.",0,0,Andrew Roddy,8472016

The things, I learned, are that  intellectual humility is connected to different things as stated by different professors. So each of professors were correct, then their views would be more confusing than clarifying. However, intellectual humility is a very controversial topic and it is good to look at it from different angle.",0,0,Hubert  Woo,2600685

If people understood this concept, Trump would not have won.  But the section on correlations and data speak are really a bit tedious.   Coursera is not really the format for data-intense courses on statistics, in my view the key is to focus on main conclusions and lectures should not be a reproduction of research results as in a technical paper re-.broadcast.",0,0,D S,15118595

I personally think that while everyone should take this course, its lessons may hit closer to home among those with advanced higher education who tend to be less sensitive to the flaws and shortcomings of their faculties. Regardless of our standing in life, our biological commonalities being part of the same species leave room for ""errors"" that can wreak havoc if left unchecked.",0,0,Aedrian Abrilla,41195652
