The focus of this project is more directed towards the flow of the code versus the code itself. This is not a good course for someone who knows a little bit of code or code in another language and is looking to learn C#. This is much more geared towards someone just starting out and needing to learn how if/then/else loops and other basic procedural things.The instructor did have students copy and paste code he had previously written.
