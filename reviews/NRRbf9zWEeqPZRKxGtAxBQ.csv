The Cognos half was absolutely dreadful. Out of date tutorials that did not relate to the technology used and labs which did not function at all because they were not updated. A final assessment that did not draw on taught knowledge. And a presentation that was entirely oh yeah heres some things that I think are cool seemingly narrated by some student they dragged in off the streets who had no interest in what he was doing and was just in show off mode showcasing tricks he had learnt and things he thought were cool rather than actually you know teaching. No core learning, no thought given to the learner, just glossing over anything that might be useful with tons of information left out. The only reason I learnt anything was that the units were so bad I had to go googling to actually find out what it was the course should have taught me. In fact the Cognos units were so bad they only thing they left in my mind was a determintation to never use Cognos again. Also lets talk about the fact all software is provided for this course. Really? Because i gott say that a 30 day free trial is not free software, that is forcing a deadline on you that you might not be able to adhear to.  Whats that you say the Cognos software has a special trial linked back to this course? No it does not. It might have had once upon a time but those days are long long gone. Just the course has not been updated to frelect it. Also the grading is crazy. Despite attaining 100% in everything I recieved a grade of 96%.

The videos can also  dramatically improve, by offering more examples, and also they were recorded like TV commercials, very fast moving on screens which they needed to be more gradual for the students to follow. Unfortunately the support for this course wasn't good at all, either the support personnel didn't have the inadept knowledge of the products specially IBM Cognos, or they refused to provide educational support to help us resolve problems. The support was more like the Uber support rather than the one expected from an organization like IBM. Before taking this course I was so excited to learn all I could about the IBM Cognos. but I had to learn everything on my own at a very slower pace than I usually do. It is a shame that a course offered as part of a certification program which introduces a powerful tool which is also made by the  same company, is butchered so badly .

However, while I understand why the labs are designed for the Web version, I think there should be greater emphasis on teaching how to accomplish the same tasks using the Desktop version too, because it's hard to say in advance what kind of version learners would proceed to work with. On several tasks, I noticed significant differences between Desktop and Web (I use Office 365), and even on the final assignment, I had to divide the work between the the two versions, because not all features were available to me in one (I first created the charts I need the Desktop version for, and then uploaded the workbook to Web to finish the assignment there with the features I could only use there).Both Cognos and Excel bits should be updated to reflect current terminology and layouts. On multiple occasions, I found myself looking at something that didn't match the instructions, only to realize that feature had been moved or renamed.
As for the peer-assessment, please consider it mandatory for reviewers to leave a comment to explain if they dock points - I'm always happy to give full marks where applicable, but I also leave a comment to explain what was missing if I rate it anything less than the maximum (I had a strange experience with someone docking random points off my assignment with no explanation, forcing me to resubmit and wait for a second opinion, only to then receive an almost-perfect score).",0,1,Yo'Av Dar,9593194
