5067546~COURSE!~AXxayz5CEeeQDg6xSmfOXg,1661889383476,1,0,"The specialization was already challenging until I reached this course, then it became downright frustrating.I got to week 2, and the assignment just did not have enough explanation or previous teaching. The ""guide"" given with the assignment straight up tells you to look stuff up on Wikipedia for help. After several attempts and frustration I eventually turned to the forums where I would post my code and my questions and never receive a response. After several weeks I would make another post, still no response. I think that the teacher has all but abandoned this course, as now I also notice it was removed from the specialization and replaced with a different course. It got to the point where I started taking a completely different course that was focused on the subject of the week 2 assignment before I realized how asinine that is as a concept and finally dropped this course.",0,1,Christopher Zawistowski,5067546

Studying design patterns and data structures on you own can be a little tricky so it was a great opportunity to learn about those topics in this course of the specialization. My main problem with this course (and the reason for giving it 4 stars out 5), was the lack of enough exercises. More exercises could really help with grasping the concepts. Also I think theory-based contents can be tested by exams only, so while I appreciate the weekly assignments I think a final exam could help determining if students have properly absorbed the course materials.

I have always loved playing videogames and 
my programming experience was limited to some arduino in high school. I 
joined this course because I wanted to learn progamming in a way I 
cannot not be motivated. After this course, I am able not only to create
 some Unity games in C#, but also some scripts for Google Apps Script 
(kind of java), and probably in any language, thanks to the great 
explanations given by Dr. T.
