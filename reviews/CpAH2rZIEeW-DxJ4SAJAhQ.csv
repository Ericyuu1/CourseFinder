7542139~COURSE!~CpAH2rZIEeW-DxJ4SAJAhQ,1550013927382,2,0,"Week 1 is great, and I learned things that my criminally negligent arts teachers never bothered to cover. Weeks 2 and 3 start to show a decline that is hinted at in week 1, however: students seem unable or unwilling to count, and my grades depend on their ability, in some cases, to count 5 sketched objects. When I see a row of 3 and a row of 2, I get 5. When this problem intensified in later weeks, including having one of my projects dismantled by a student grading it (and then scoring it down as not having 5 holes, when I was looking at 14), I started to lose hope. When I tried contacting a mentor, coursera, or anyone affiliated with the class or the site, I found nothing except a loop through pages promising that the next one would do what I wanted if I only clicked a link.In the meantime, I have managed to teach myself more than I need for my own purposes, have switched gears into the patent search, and have walked away without bothering with the last two weeks. If I had paid for this, I would be demanding a refund, plus damages.",0,0,Andrew Purvis,7542139
22188968~COURSE!~CpAH2rZIEeW-DxJ4SAJAhQ,1527443757814,2,0,"Is this an educational course or an advertisement for Autodesk?  You will only experience and be told of Autodesk products:  Sketchbook, Tinkercad, and Fusion 360.  No other design programs are mentioned much less compared and contrasted.  No mention of Illustrator (vs Sketchbook), OpenSCAD (vs Tinkercad) or Solidworks (vs Fusion 360).  Set up in this manner, it shouldn't require a $79 Coursera fee given that this is setup to capture new students into Autodesk's product line.  Meshmixer is an Autodesk product and oddly isn't even mentioned, despite being widely used in the 3D printing community.  The course is overly focused on free-flowing design.  Despite being a 3D-design class made to be embedded in the 3D printing industry, you never have a video or assignment that has you make a part or item to specified measurements.  This is a real gap in the teachings; I would argue to have replaced Week 4 on sculpting with a module on adding dimensions and locking relationships and measurements (lengths, angles) between parts and components.  The class instructor, Jeff Smith, has never responded to a forum post or question in the history of the class.  The fifth week of class is taught by a student rather than industry expert and he is not given teaching credit.  The sixth week is empty and is used to pad the course up to the 6-week, $79 fee scale.    Two weeks of focus on Fusion 360 is insufficient given the amount of content the instructor is teaching in the videos.  For new modelers, a week on sculpting feels like too much; it's nice to make pretty shapes (starships/bicycle seats), but what about shapes needing defined precision?  It would be great to learn to build two gears from scratch that turn with one another.  If instructor disagrees with this philosophy, at the least it would be great to use sculpt tools to make a specific item with the sculpt having some sort of goal.  Making free shapes is easier but less useful after taking this class.  All or nearly all of the sculpted shapes you will make would be very, very difficult to print.  Time is wasted on learning rendering - after all, this class is focused on 3D printing, not sales or marketing (the reasons the instuctor gave for using rendering).    Additional issues are below:  Course is unorganized and outdated.  - Example 1:  even though this is a recent class, the Autodesk product videos are outdated.  The software used by the instructor is a different version with commands in different locations.  This increases the difficulty in learning.  For instance, in the Create menu, primatives have swapped places with basic functions.    -Example 2: 123D Catch is no longer a product that we can use - why is there still a video teaching this in the syllabus?  Why hasn't this teaching been updated?  This product was taken off market a year and a half ago and still the syllabus is outdated.  In the text, they state for you to download software which is not free and requires purchase (Trnio for iOS).    - Example 3: in Week 3's videos, Smith demonstrates the bottom component being grounded, but not the top component.  In the homework, we are instructed to take off points if the top component isn't grounded as well - all the other students I graded got this wrong (as did I).    - Example 4:  in Week 3's assignment, it says it is worth 14% of the grade.  However, the syllabus says it's worth 30% of the grade.    - Example 5:  T-splines are discussed heavily in Week 4 but are never defined or explained.  There is a glossary entry with a link to explain T-splines; the link has been invalid since January 2017.  Even splines are not defined or explained, much less T-splines.  - Example 6:  Material is presented out of order.  For instance, the move triad is described in Week 4 but really needs to be introduced in Week 3 when you start using Fusion 360 for the first time.  - Example 7:  Lack of organization adds to existing issues of current grading system.  For example, the instructions for Week's assignment says, ""For this first objective, you need to build a design that uses all 6 of the primitive tools, 5 times each (box, cylinder, torus, sphere, pipe)"".  We are instructed to use six different tools from a list of five tools.  Some students grade for five, some for six, because of the inconsistency in our instructions.  - Example 8:  Every submission for Week 4 I graded was flawed; the instructor has not taught students about resolving impossible geometries.  All the submissions I graded were still stuck in Sculpt mode.  When exiting Sculpt, Fusion 360 would identify impossible geometries, remove them, and leave the remaining items intact that do not violate topology.  This means that no assignment I graded had the minimum number of shapes - if students thought they needed 12 shapes to grade, they would make 12, but 2-4 would be impossible.  Since no student I graded understood this, I suggest this is a failing of the class/instructor.  Failure of student grading system, which adds to stress when paying for the class:  - Lack of student graders when turned in on time (see multitude of forum posts asking for previous week's assignments to be graded.)  Typically, students not paying for the course do not volunteer to grade assignments.  - Some students are unable to open traditional graphic image files (e.g., TIFFs) in this 3D modeling class.  They flag your submission which adds to the grading probem.   Another student did not understand that to peer-grade assignments, he would need to be able to copy and paste URLs / site addresses (or as an excuse to not grade).  There needs to be a prerequiste statement that students are expected to be able to use basic web tools and browsers, able to open typical graphic formats, etc.  The instructor could help reduce this by allowing hyperlinks in all, not some, of the student answers.  - Your fellow students grading you are obviously not subject-matter experts and do not have any more expertise or experience than you do.  Regardless, they grade your material and individuals will often misunderstand and score things incorrectly.  - If you have one of these issues, you're really on your own.  You can post in the forum for help but neither the instructor nor Coursera will provide assistance.",0,19,J. Colin Cox,22188968

You won't learn a huge amount of 3D printing knowledge from it as the course focuses more on learning how to model in different software. It's not until Week 5 that you learn more about 3D printing, scanning, and post-scan editing. Week 5 really needs to be re-worked as it still has a video on 123D Catch which has been taken off the market for awhile now, and the two other phone apps they now recommend both cost money. Trnio is only available for iOS and isn't free on the App Store, while Scann3D makes you get a monthly subscription in order to export/download your scan to put on SketchFab (which is required for the assignment).The peer review aspect can be challenging as well, especially towards the last couple weeks when the course is coming to an end. Many students don't continue on past the first few weeks which can make it difficult to find enough people to mark yours at the end. It might not be as bad if you're taking the course for free, but if you decided to pay to get a certificate it can add a lot of stress. A huge number of posts in the discussion boards are people asking others to review their assignments, and a majority of them are unanswered. The moderators don't respond to a large number of questions/software issue/grading issues etc. people have, which makes it difficult if you run into a problem at any time in the course. Jeff has never actually posted or responded to any discussion thread in the entire time this course has been available for people. The only posts you see by him are from the session introductions for each intake and the optional discussion post questions. Overall, this course has its pros and cons. The videos are very well done, but there will probably be a lot of stress in other sections when you're completing it. If you're fine resolving issues that come up while taking it on your own, then it should be a good course. ",0,0,Shannon Horne,35279978

I feel the actual content of the course is too good to be locked in such a system and hope the upcoming updates to coursera policy can improve this situation. 

I tried to flag as many of these as possible. But since flagging does not count as a completed peer review and I require a minimum of 3 completed peer reviews to complete the course I sometimes simply gave a 0 instead.

It starts with how to sketch 2d shapes in Autodesk SketchBook, which, in my opinion, is a great alternative for paint, because it provides the users to draw straight lines and isometric as well as perspective cubes. In using the Sketchbook software, be sure to use the Draw Style tab to draw a straight line, regular rectangle, and regular circle. Also, use the Perspective Guides (P) tab to draw a perspective and isometric cube. The guides control the directions to which the mouse pointer is going to draw.Next, it learns how to use TINKERCAD, which is free software, like SketchBook. Actually, it is very enjoyable when we use free software like these ones.Then, I could learn how to start with Fusion 360, which is one of the most-used software in the 3D Printing industry, and it is also used for CAD/CAM projects greatly as well.Lastly, the students could learn how to scan a 3d real-world part using even their smartphone.
