437695~COURSE!~rWu2xht9EemZVg5FbfvC7A,1599535128757,1,0,Totally disjointed from the rest of the coursework and the specialty in general.  I would not take this course unless you are working specifically in data analytics (and R).  From an MBA perspective it is not a good course or a good specialty.  Very poorly put together.  ,0,0,Tom Brown,437695

39935057~COURSE!~rWu2xht9EemZVg5FbfvC7A,1598671302506,2,0,While this course attempts to cover important aspects of financial analytics and time series models but it ends up extensively being a programming course with only briefly touching the theory or practical use cases. If you are looking a a programming course for financial analytics then this is not the one. Also the lab exercises in coursera are cumbersome to complete  and often has technical issues which makes the learning experience counterproductive.,0,1,Subhajyoti Chanda,39935057
