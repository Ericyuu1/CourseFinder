45523159~COURSE!~3HSicScxEeWP8AqYi9cmiw,1574364626216,2,0,"The concepts are interesting, and I learned a lot about making online materials accessible. Having the option to download the videos is great in case we want to revisit them for future reference. I really liked the interactive transcript feature displayed on the course, I believe it models best practices! I would suggest to update the videos so they have a more contemporary look. Also, I would suggest to have accessibility experts evaluating our assignments--relying solely on other classmates takes away from  the credibility of the  course and does not allow for us to really know if our suggestions were truly pertinent. Moreover, the instructions should reflect the evaluation criteria. I would complete an assignment and then, when correcting another one, i would realize that the instructions did not fully correspond to the criteria. For instance, when captioning a video the duration time was not specified in the instructions, but the criteria said it had to be at least 2 minutes. ",0,3,Erika Giraldo,45523159

It's mentioned several times to ""avoid using a Mac to create or check accessible content"" which isn't very helpful to us Mac only users. Office 365 does have accessibility features and checker, so it seems a shame to not include those Mac users or keep the course up to date. Can't find any information on the course publish date but as they are referring to office 2013 it would suggest that it is several years behind.",0,3,Madlen O'Reilly,45441657
91282719~COURSE!~3HSicScxEeWP8AqYi9cmiw,1669246511648,4,0,"Pros: 1. Presenter and material was well planned, 2. activities for learners were varied, 3. teaching through a variety of modes. Cons: 1. Completing the course is dependent on there being other people taking the course at the same time, but this is not clear until you submit your first assignment for peer-review. During my study, only 1 other person was available to grade my assignments, and I had to wait until that person logged in. If they had chosen to go through the modules more slowly, I might have had to wait a long time until their next study session. 2. The primary instructor's presentations/videos were recorded in 2016. Most of the websites referenced in the lectures have been updated since then, so when the Instructor said 'go to this tab on this resource website' those directions were no longer applicable and quite confusing.",0,0,Ayla Heartsong,91282719

I struggled with the peer review process required to ""complete"" each module: there was never anything to review until Monday night or Tuesday night, with a deadline to review for Wednesday. It was difficult to balance the peer review requirement in such a small timeframe when I was also juggling a full time job *and* teaching in the evenings. I wish they would revise this portion of the course to make it more accessible. Otherwise, I definitely learned A LOT and benefited tremendously from this course.
