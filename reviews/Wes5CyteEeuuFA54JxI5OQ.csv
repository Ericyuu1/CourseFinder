79786297~COURSE!~Wes5CyteEeuuFA54JxI5OQ,1663190270800,1,0,"This is a fairly short course, that is one good thing to say. Another is that the course staff are generally fairly quick to respond. But there the good ends. O​f all the IBM courses in the specialization, this was the poorest.T​he topic is either very difficult (and I was never sure throughout this that NodeJS& React wasnt a design mish mash of an old concept pathced with so much sticking plaster it was almost incdeciperable ) or the course was woefully inadeqaute to teach it. The videos were superficial and glossed over a lot of complicated stuff very quickly, at times I completely lost the thread of ideas being communicated and wondered if I had nodded off and missed a bit of it. Rewinding assured me I hadnt!T​he techncial quality of the instruction too was much thinner than the rest of the course - many typos, and lacking depth of explanation - sometimes telling one waht to do but lacking and explanation as to why.T​he web based development environment - which was tempramental in the other courses prevented me from actually completing this as required by the course guide, and I needed to knife and fork a solution. I could only do that becuase I had taken most of the subsequent courses before I did this one (out of order).T​he discussion forum are packed with others with the same problems I had. The problems are not new and havent been fixed - most advice was of the 'turn it off and on again' variety! And  the advice from staff in response was contradictory, and indeed set me back a lot as it erronously caused me to edit the wrong file - one that was needed later in the course!B​ottom line from me is that if you want to complete the specalization then dont take this course early on in the set - if I had I'd have given up to be honest! If you can - avoid it until they rewrite it",0,1,David Bush,79786297

The final project was also very frustrating b/c various components are being deprecated and there are problems in the code that have to be manually updated but we're not given the skills in the course really to address that.
