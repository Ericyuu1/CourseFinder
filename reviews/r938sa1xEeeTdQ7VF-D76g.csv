The assignments are very shallow and do not translate much of what is being taught into applying it. 
Last but not least, and thats the worst part: the course demonstrates Design Thinking in the case of product strategy of Swiss Re and Ubank, goes from empathy mapping to problem statement to prototyping and testing - and the final assignment is about creating a Business Model Canvas - which is of course not wrong to do as such but in light of a course that is supposed to integrate design strategy with corporate strategy, a Business Model Canvas alone seems to be a very weak answer to all the areas a corporate strategy entails.
