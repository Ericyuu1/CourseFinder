23119297~COURSE!~AMBr8zelEeWJaxK5AT4frw,1617333706604,1,0,"The course deals with very essential topics of App Development, however, the course contents is extremely outdated as currently developers are using Swift 5 or Swift UI with a Xcode version of 12.X or later for App Development. It is disappointing to learn that after updating to the latest version of MacOS, we aren’t able to download the Xcode version 7.3.X that was required for this course. Hence, I would like to urge the creator of this course, that if the contents of the course could be updated so that the learning from the course does not go to waste.",0,0,Mustafa Jabir Poonawala,23119297

Xcode 8 will break our code"".It is sadder to know the knowledge we learn in this course doesn't apply to modern technology.One more thing, the course forum is poorly maintained.
