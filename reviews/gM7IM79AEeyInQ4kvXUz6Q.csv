With regards to this course, considering it has been put out by the makers of Facebook, the introduction is the only up-to-date part, as the content is sorely lacking. Assessments often ask for answers that have yet to be taught, and their lab interface should be easily available outside of the required lab work so people can practice. The programming for the week 5 assessment is horribly flawed - it won't matter how you answer, or how many times you go through the assessment, you will get marked wrong, which is where customer service, or a chat box, or anything responsive would come in handy - and as such it does nothing but eat time, energy, and burn hope.

The course assignments and quizes are dire. Several mistakes, including the end assignment, which means unless I bite the bullet and put the WRONG answer in, I'll never get 100%. 

For those interested:
Question 8 is abigious - What is the right answer? 
Question 19 is completely wrong (It IS diagram 2)
You ask for complete SQL statements and then key words, and then back to SQL statements, so if someone puts in the full SQL statement, the very basic assignment marking system goes ""Oh I can't see a single word of 'Values', it must be wrong"". 
Oh and you have member number in the question and player number in the answer, also who stores telephone numbers as ints?!

You will start with the fundamentals work our way up to some advance topics. I like the part wherein we will be practicing in the SQL commands in the lab. Though it is not user-friendly because we see results in the terminal (not a problem since it's just introduction and I believe we will be using GUI through MySQL) but it' great to have experience running queries using terminal to understand SQL concepts. I also like that the topics on database design, schema and normalization are included. It's is not always that you see courses which includes those topics. Thank you, Meta!",0,0,Bernard D.
