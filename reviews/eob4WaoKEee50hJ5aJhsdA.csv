No one gives you feedback so you have to make the most of the course for yourself. The teaching content is not bad. That is why I have given it a 3 star. But I had my project stolen twice by other students. When I was marking on two occasions I had a student that uploaded my project as their own. I flagged these submissions but I don't know if anything happens. Students upload random links and unreadable documents. It has made this experience feel a bit like a joke.
