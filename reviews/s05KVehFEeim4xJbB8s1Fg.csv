The course work is, and I  quote, ""a project with minimal scaffolding. Expect to use the the  discussion forums to gain insights! It’s not cheating to ask others for  opinions or perspectives"". In other words, part of the learning target  is to work through bad or incomplete documentation and to solve an  exercise that is stated without providing the information you need to  solve it. Unless someone else already went through the moves, the  lecturer fully expects you to fail by yourself.

I thought the coverage of classes and object-oriented programming (OOP) was not all that great. I have a background in C++/C# so thankfully I already have a solid understanding of OOP, because otherwise I don't think I would have gained much real-world understanding from this course. While it shows you the basics of how to create classes and inherit from other classes, it's very light on how the OOP paradigm is intended to be used. There's very little to no discussion of the core aspects of Abstraction and Polymorphism which are absolutely essential to using it properly.These courses would have better done with examples that build upon each other, rather than isolated one-off examples each time. That way students can gradually see how different aspects of the language combine with each other to result in larger, more complex programs. That is even more the case in this course. You go from a bunch of tiny, isolated examples to a whopping 250 line final project that is orders of magnitude more complicated than anything else encountered previously in the Specialization. For someone totally new to programming this must have been extremely intimidating. The code in the final project should have been distributed throughout the course in examples building up to it rather than hitting you with it all at once. A couple other nitpicks. First, there is an awkward and out-of-place 30 minute segue into the Django web development framework which, in my opinion, contributed very little understanding to the concepts of classes and OOP. Second, the instructors created a custom implementation only available on their online textbook to demonstrate unit testing. Python already has built-in assertion functionality for testing, so I don't understand why that was not used in favor of something students won't even be able to use in an actual Python environment.",0,0,Michael Koehmstedt,49102917

Course 5 (the capstone project) was an abomination. Basically zero instruction / guidance and very frustrating for anybody except decently experienced programmers. If courses 1-4 are your only exposure to Python, you could easily spend a month or more on this project. If getting the Specialization Certificate is very important to you, there are resources online that you can leverage to complete the project but that is done largely at the expense of any real learning, so I really hope UofM comes up with an alternative final project that is more consistent with the level of expertise attained in courses 1-5 (maybe something on implementing classic algorithms?).
