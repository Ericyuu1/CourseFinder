22121217~COURSE!~ZUXCNgc6EeuwKxK7YOM9Xw,1610919253202,1,0,"This course isn't as good as it could be for two reasons:1.
I don't understand who it's desighned for. It's too easy and obvious for people
who know even a little in GD or know some basics of Photoshop(or GIMP).
However, it's confusing for people who know nothing about graphic design.2.The
idea to work on small cloud screen is not as good as it sounds. Even with good
vision and quite big screen on my PC, it's a torture. Also, the instructor speaks English badly.Result - wasted time.",0,0,Vladislav Golovatenko,22121217
