74476900~COURSE!~gu_xVZoPEeip2g7lw9YI7A,1648763749373,5,0,"T​his course is interesting if you have at least a base in basic/herbal medicine as it gives an inside of both conventional and herbal medicine. Its difficulty, however, is not basic level, which is great as a challenge and to make sure you sit down and study carefully all the materia you get offered. The interviews with the different doctors give a nice touch to the couse as it gives an inside view of THM from the eyes of a doctor from that region that uses it  rather than someone who read the information in a papar and decided to preach it. The recipes are easy to follow with herbs that arent extremely rare or hard to find, and can be easily prepared. Even if the course is only related to THM, it has a section about treating the patient in a more intimate way and constructing a trust relationship which I think is a big step that differentiates from conventional care.",0,0,Monica Alarcon Ramos,74476900
