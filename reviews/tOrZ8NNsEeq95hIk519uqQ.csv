Only real code was data preprocessing, and this was pretty bad: implementing in 10-15 lines of python, what can be done in a single line in pandas (if you're going to use a library, might as well *use it*!)",0,3,Gencho Zhilkov,3343006

For example the recipie includes ingridents that are not in the list, and some sometimes odd things are mixed like cream and lemon.inaccurancies and hallucinate  are not addressed in this course. But if you just want to understand the pipework and how to use google colab its not bad.",0,2,Mohammad Jahanbin,101852752
19232793~COURSE!~tOrZ8NNsEeq95hIk519uqQ,1614314988932,3,0,"I do not recommend taking this type of course, take one and pass it, however after a few days I have tried to review the material, and my surprise is that it asks me to pay again to be able to review the material. Of course coursera gives me a small discount for having already paid it previously.
It is very easy to download the videos and difficult to get hold of the material, but with ingenuity it is possible. Then I recommend uploading them to YouTube and keeping them private for when they want to consult (they avoid legal problems and can share with friends), then they can request a refund.
