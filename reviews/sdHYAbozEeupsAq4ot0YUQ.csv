I did the math on how many times they repeat the words ""Health Systems Strengthening"";Module 1 - 50 times in 91 minutes (avg every 1 min 49 sec)Module 2 - 34 times in 47 minutes and 15 seconds (avg every 1 min 38 sec)Module 3 - 32 times in 48 minutes and 25 seconds (avg every 1 min 30 sec)Total - 116 times over 3 hours, 6 mins, 4 seconds (avg every 1 min and 36 sec)I am so numb to the words ""Health Systems Strengthening"" at this point.  Repeating yourself to the learner every 90 seconds for over 3 hours is brutal.  I couldn't be bothered to calculate the actual time that this took out of the course, but im betting a good 10 minutes saying one word.",0,0,Michael King,90159813
