But I hate the quizzes and notebooks throughout the course that don't provide better guidance or step-by-step solution checking. It would be much better overall if quizzes and notebooks in the courses either provided step-by-step solution checking or provided the solutions so students could check their work along the way. I’d much prefer the notebooks provide the solutions or most of the solutions and have a difficult final project for each course where there were no solutions given. I’d learn much more through the course and have confidence while completing the final projects, and have a sense of accomplishment that I applied what I learned.

I think this course was missing more coding exercises though. This is a deep subject, and a critical one in the AV world, so I'm very disappointed that there weren't more of these to illustrate how to solve some common motion planning problems.The final project is also very weak. I understand that motion planning is very complex and involves a lot of math (making it difficult to create an assignment that isn't overwhelmingly difficult), but the final assignment is full of hand-holding, making already easy tasks trivial. Most of the interesting parts are already done for you, so I didn't have to think about motion planning at all. On top of that there is an error in the Coursera-provided code which students have pointed out a year ago, yet still exists. Fix this!I think this course is worth doing if you are pursuing the Self Driving Car curriculum, and it has some solid information in it, but just don't expect to get rich coverage.
