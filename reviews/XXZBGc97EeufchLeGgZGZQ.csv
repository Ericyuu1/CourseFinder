117428371~COURSE!~XXZBGc97EeufchLeGgZGZQ,1672950455902,2,0,"I would have given this course three stars but the mistakes in the final assignment which took me forever to figure out due to my being a novice lost them an additional star.

The instructions give you a partial syntax of a GRANT statement but place DATABASE after rather than before the DATABASE name causing me to have to eventually figure out that the error I was experiencing was due to COURSERA providing the incorrect syntax for the assignment.

Glad I had the opportunity to troubleshoot but I have seen too many examples of sloppy course design as I have gone thorough the Data Engineering IBM certificate program.",0,2,David Baldwin,117428371

76375511~COURSE!~XXZBGc97EeufchLeGgZGZQ,1638892551277,5,0,"Very good course which allows to approach the concepts of relational database administration.
I found this course technical but the alternation between theory and practice allows to assimilate the notions well!
I do not recommend this course to people who have no knowledge of databases, a course on RDBMS is necessary before.",0,0,Natale Foata,76375511
