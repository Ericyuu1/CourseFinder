113502468~COURSE!~gXoO7BhYEeqmcg5cP6lwPw,1675020707443,5,0,"It is one of the best compact course in Excel spreadsheet in coursera. It covers several advanced topics in Statistics and Data Analysis by using a lot of advanced techniques in Excel combining with the corresponding literacy. The main syllabus prepares someone to follow other methods in Machine Learning and Time-series Statistics (like, ARIMA) or Classification Methods, even though to learn these important methods. It was a happy moment to learn about data cleaning and several concepts like Pivot Tables, Interaction Statistics, Seasonal Analysis,... etc. After this successful attendance, I am very confident to work on Prediction Analysis by using a spreadsheet and being able to explain what happens in different numerical results and graphs. This course applies as a complement unit to a solid background in statistics and mathematics (i.e., series expansion, F-test, etc) for a better understanding of the common stochastic models in Time-series module. It is not a mathematically  oriented unit but the mathematics is the basic thinking.  A special note: This course gives a first view of Excel Solver for optimization problems that is important to the course 3 of this specialization. ",0,0,Nb,113502468
