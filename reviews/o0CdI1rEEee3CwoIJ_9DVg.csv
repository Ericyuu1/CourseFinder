There are a lot of free available materials online. The content is really poor. Apart from the introductory (videos) that are of poor quality by the way, the others lessons are not even given by a real person. They are just slides red by a machine. But the worst part is that apart from the quizzes there is 0 home assignments. The only assignments are things like: Take some time to think about this and write your thoughts in this textbox => USELESS",0,5,Adrien Biarnes,10631467
