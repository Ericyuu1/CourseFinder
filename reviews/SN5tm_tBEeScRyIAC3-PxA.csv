The introduction looked very appealing, so I immediately bought it. It is the first course when I can state that it was a complete waste of time and effort. In my opinion, the teaching skills of an author are fairly low. The material is supplied in a linear manner and honestly, after watching lectures almost no information stays.

I do however, have a number of problems with the learning material, which is why I've given 3 stars.First, learning ProM, one of the Process Mining tools (the other being Disco). ProM is meant to be a more flexible and powerful tool, and is considerably more difficult to understand than Disco. However, Disco actually got its own video series explaining the details of how it works, with a step-by-step walkthrough. The ProM walkthrough was hidden inside the Honours Tool Quiz. There is a single video before that which gives an overview of ProM, but that's all it is, an overview.In my personal opinion, the real reason ProM is difficult, is because it has a confusingly designed interface and little in-app explanation of its workings. This is, however, besides the point, and I'm not letting this impact the review of the course itself. I would just like to contest the concept of something necessarily being more difficult to learn just because it can do more.Onwards to my second main gripe with this course - I was not impressed by the quality of the learning material. In one particular instance, when they introduce the Alpha algorithm, they begin by dumping 8 lines of dense set theory. Mind you, I'm already familiar with set theory, but I feel sorry for anyone who does not. I would have appreciated a more intuitive explanation.Mind you - as I said before, if you are interested in Process Mining, this is a course you want to try. I just have high standards for teaching materials.",0,3,Eric Risbakk,81556698

The quiz are not timed, even though there is a time indication.  Some questions on the quiz have multiple correct answers, which are sometimes very subjective and tricky to get right.  Lots of mental gymnastics and computation.  Sadly, the concept of peer-graded assignment to strive for honors roll does not work well as the number of learners at anytime is very few, if any.

In one of the last lessons, I came to the understanding that I want to apply process mining to spaghetti-structured event data, therefore I had to learn a lot about prediction, recommendation and so on which than turned out to be completely useless for me. I have the same feeling for the petri net, workflow syste, BPMI and so on that are presented; this is only useful for some users while this takes a large part of the study time.
