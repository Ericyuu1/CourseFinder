Plus not all good coding practices are followed. But in general, worth spending an hour.",0,1,Hanna Loch-Olszewska,8032015
95274294~COURSE!~FobmyP2XEeqeswrC1PE4Rw,1640280106752,3,0,"I really appreciate the effort of the lecturer to offer this, but it is not possible to receive a grade higher than 80%, because the grader has technical issues. The quiz has questions that are literally mentioned in the course, but there is one question where it does not accept the right answer. Even the feedback on your mistake mentions the right answer, but the grader does not accept it. The lecturer does nothing about it even though multiple people have pointed it out. I am not going to use the certificate if the maximum you can receive is only 80%. ",0,0,Brent Hendrickx,95274294
19232793~COURSE!~FobmyP2XEeqeswrC1PE4Rw,1614315576843,3,0,"The course is horrible, the font size of the work environment is very small (I increase the size but it becomes difficult to work)It does not allow you to download the resources you work on !!!!Possible with some ingenuity ...Do like me, finish before the week and get your money back.I do not recommend taking this type of course, take one and pass it, however after a few days I have tried to review the material, and my surprise is that it asks me to pay again to be able to review the material. Of course coursera gives me a small discount for having already paid it previously.
It is very easy to download the videos and difficult to get hold of the material, but with ingenuity it is possible. Then I recommend uploading them to YouTube and keeping them private for when they want to consult (they avoid legal problems and can share with friends), then they can request a refund.
