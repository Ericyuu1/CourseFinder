Since this couse is partially based on reviews how is it possible that people are premitted to submit reviews anonymouslly? Worse yet they give one or two word response. As a writer the need for feedback is crucial for learning how to improve your writing skills and if what you write is done well. I don't understand why this practice is allowed. Why would people want to remain anonymous anyway. I am very disappointed and I will be sure to contiue with my complaints on social media. ,0,0,Tanya Wheeler,98057052

On two separate occasions the peer feedback appeared to be written by someone who was new to English.  They were confused about the most basic aspects of my assignments while other reviewers were not. On two other occasions the person providing the feedback simply provided one word three times because this is enough to fool the computer system into believing you have provided feedback and allow you to move on in the course.

It was a great experience. This course enhanced my writing skill to a whole new level. The most important thing is that it was both: challenging and fun.
I would recommended to anyone who wishes to improve their skill as a writer, storyteller, and so on.
You would regret it if you don't enroll on this one. By the way, language is not a excuse. English is not my mother language, and I had a lot of fun with this course. It also improved my writing skill. Grammar is a must.
Cheers!
