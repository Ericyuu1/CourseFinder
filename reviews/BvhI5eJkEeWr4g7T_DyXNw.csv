65115059~COURSE!~BvhI5eJkEeWr4g7T_DyXNw,1594424255182,5,0,"This course provides a very fundamental introduction of the industry of translation. Students will learn a lot of the basic concepts of translation, localization, globalization and internationalization.  It is a very helpful course for students who are going or planning to pursue education in the field of translation and localization, it helps you develop a big picture about the fields and a better understanding about what you are going to learn and what you going to do past graduation. Overall, its very insightful and inspiring course.
