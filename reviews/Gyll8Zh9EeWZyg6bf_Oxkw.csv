On the other hand, as a biologist trying to learn programming, this course was insufficient.  Very little of the programming code was explained (and considered obvious?).  I spent a lot of time googling to understand the code so that I could not only learn but complete the assignments.  There are some concepts (like the use of __init__) which I still do not understand.  Also, the ""hints"" to accomplish the homework assignments were definitely not well explained.  I only managed to increase the speed of my programs by going through the discussion forums for hours until I found something that helped.  Also, as a biologist, it is obvious that this course is not designed so that a computer programmer learns much about the biology.  A simple (but necessary!!) change would be to refer to the left and right as 5' and 3'.  Using biological terminology would have helped me understand what the lecturer was talking about.Plainly, this is a course for a computer person to learn more code.

I realize that it is hard to know where to start the course from but it is true that the Introductory Course for the Genomics Specialization has a lot of over lapping material.  I suggest getting rid of your intro material and go just a little farther in depth.Thanks, MC",0,0,M CC,2343110
16072933~COURSE!~Gyll8Zh9EeWZyg6bf_Oxkw,1492538646325,5,0,I really appreciate how much effort the authors have put into the course 'Algorithsms for DNA sequencing'. The clarity of the lectures is absolutely amazing and the assignments are doable. The assignments took me a lot of time because my only programming background is the 'Python for Genomic Data Science' course. Another really positive aspect about this course is  that it helped to consolidate the python coding I had learned in the previous course.,0,0,Julia Okrut,16072933

I wish there are more hints or test examples. It would be better to include some reference papers for those who are more interested in the sequencing techniques and methods to read by themselves.
