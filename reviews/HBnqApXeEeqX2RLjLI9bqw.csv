87571010~COURSE!~HBnqApXeEeqX2RLjLI9bqw,1624279706262,3,0,"The course included a lot of aspects of digitalization and servicification. It was really interesting to know how sustainability is achieved in its truest sense by integrating it completely into a business rather than treating it as a secondary objective. This course also broadened my scope of sustainability.However, I believe that some contents can be better explained with easier examples. It should not be necessary to use examples of huge companies present in the world to explain a concept. Even a made-up company can be used and its simple model be illustrated so to make things easy to understand.Also, many of the points from different perspectives seemed to correlate. Therefore, it would have been good if classification of those points had been done under the correct headings.Overall, a good and though-provoking course.",0,3,Ahmad Abdul Aziz,87571010

Talks from the industry leaders, providing reference points and real challenges is really insightful. As sustainability is becoming the focal area for safeguarding the mother earth and environment in particular this is a good beginning to understand the basics.  ",0,0,Naga Booshan,88530180

84583261~COURSE!~HBnqApXeEeqX2RLjLI9bqw,1621234591304,4,0,"The topics are great as an introduction to the topic and there were many good additional readings that I will continue looking into. The course cover many different angles of sustainability (UN goals, policies, frameworks, organizational change etc ) in a short period of time. There were too many men presenting and too few women in the course. I also did not love the way that the camera changes angles during presentations. Better to keep one angle. Staffan Movin is unfortunately a bit tiring to listen to and it is sometimes difficult to hear what he says as he sometimes rushes through the words and mumbles (which you can also see in the transcripts as they are a bit off at times).I would have loved to get more out of the conversations with other participants, maybe there is an opportunity to moderate that more? For coursera: there is an bug in test week 3, where the correct answer in one of the last question gives an error.",0,1,Charlotta Lundberg,84583261
