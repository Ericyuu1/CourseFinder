The egregious error in mis-reading the final quote and fervently basing his argument on the mi-read quote thatHEplaced on the slide final slide of Week four, I decided yo leave the couse.

Ditto the events around Black Hawk Down.  We should have had a lot more variety!  While the peer-assessed assignments were interesting, it's disdheartening to have your grade based on wether or not someone else looked at it.  Also we should not have been asked to grade 3 or 4 other assignments - one is enough.  I was not happy with the quizzes either since too many of the questions related to which person said this or that and not enough to the events and the underlying causes for manipulation of reporting.  Also time was wasted on listening to grad students talking about their own research and assignments.  I would still recommend this course because I learned a lot of interesting things.
