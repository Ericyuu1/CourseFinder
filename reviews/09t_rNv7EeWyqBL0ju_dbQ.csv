52286337~COURSE!~09t_rNv7EeWyqBL0ju_dbQ,1585349324392,3,0,"A lot of interesting content, fabulous guest speakers, and thought-provoking arrangement. The main problems have to do with speed and presentation. There could have been better efforts to produce a printed transcript of some of the videos that is a correct transcript and not bad close-captioning. Also, as someone else said, with the high pacing of the course, one often feels dropped in the middle of a much longer discussion (which one probably is, due to editing constraints), so what should be a solid overview ends up feeling like a break-neck I-missed-something course. Supplemental text materials would have helped tremendously in certain modules.",0,5,Jillian Avalon,52286337

Especially when listening to a guest lecture. A bit more context and text is required about the conversation.,0,3,disheka jakhar,30894728
