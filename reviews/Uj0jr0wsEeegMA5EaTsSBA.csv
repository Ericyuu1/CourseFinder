72562749~COURSE!~Uj0jr0wsEeegMA5EaTsSBA,1602426865020,2,0,"A very hard and advanced course, definitely not for intermediate or beginner level. This course should have been more of a specialization rather than a single course",0,0,Bablu Party,72562749
10095225~COURSE!~Uj0jr0wsEeegMA5EaTsSBA,1560170029066,2,0,Few important concepts were rushed through in the course. Short videos resulted in skipping through the required mathematical and conceptual discussions to get a proper feel of the topics. The content of the course was however pretty good covering a decent range of topics in vibration dynamics.,0,5,Vinayak Varma,10095225
67931456~COURSE!~Uj0jr0wsEeegMA5EaTsSBA,1623265597453,3,0,The course covers interesting topics but unfortunately some important parts are covered very quickly and i lost in formulas.I really did not like the quizzes that required more knowledge that taught during the course.,0,1,RENDINA CRISTIAN,67931456
14413817~COURSE!~Uj0jr0wsEeegMA5EaTsSBA,1612057751325,3,0,It is not a basic course and it is too general. You need to know about advanced calculus and understand about dynamics systems and signals. But it is a great course because you can understand vibrations are around you and everything is about motion.,0,0,Ivonne Martinez T,14413817

43771110~COURSE!~Uj0jr0wsEeegMA5EaTsSBA,1572626127582,3,0,"The course covers a lot of different subjects about waves, which is very nice. I feel much more confident about my understanding of water waves, acoustics, and the wave equation (tensioned cable). It was very difficult to take notes and keep up with the math, however. I ended up watching lectures multiple times to understand what was happening on the math side. While this course gave a good conceptual understanding, I was hoping to be able to apply this knowledge to vibration systems at my work. I did not reach that level as a consequence of this course, but perhaps if I was able to put much more time into understanding this course, I could have gotten there. It would have been very useful if they explained how to construct the stiffness matrices in more detail during the vibrations portion. Thank you very much to everyone involved, however! I enjoyed the course overall.",0,2,Marcus Schmidt,43771110

79261103~COURSE!~Uj0jr0wsEeegMA5EaTsSBA,1643995362928,4,0,"The course is not too detailed, but gives a good overview of waves and vibrations and a basic understanding of mode analysis. The quizes are rather poorly composed, as they are hardly supported by the theory of the course, and there is also no description of the solutions to them. This leads to the fact that the answers to some questions have to be guessed. Unfortunately, the PDF slides that can be downloaded are basically pretty useless. So, be prepared for the fact that it will take a lot of time to complete the quizzes and you will have to read additional literature or google.After completing the course, I do not feel that I have a confident command of the material, but still, now I have a better understanding of the topic. The course can be considered as a refresher or as a starting point in the study of mode analysis.Anyway, there are very few advanced math courses on Coursera, and compared to many others, this course seems worthy of attention.",0,1,Evgeniy Kaptsov,79261103

In my opinion, your course will be better if you use more examples. The concepts are full of mathematical equations, and these are so useful for good understanding; however, students will learn better if they see some mathematical or programming exercises, like the final quiz.
