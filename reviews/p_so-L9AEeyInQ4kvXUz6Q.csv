The final video player app you build doesn't work if you use the step by step instructions.

A beginner is not able to troubleshoot coding errors, and the discussion forums are filled with other learners trying to help each other, to no avail.

The wrong activity is used from the beginning of the project to all of the stuff needed done in the project is either wrong, or parts are left out. This needs to be fixed. Not only that, why even bother putting an Android Studio course at the very beginning before going over basic Kotlin? The basic Kotlin course or the Version Control course, should be first. All you're doing is confusing people who have never seen code before or had any understanding of general terms like functions or variables. Explaining them both together in a 4 minute video isn't enough to make new developers understand that sort of stuff.

106759622~COURSE!~p_so-L9AEeyInQ4kvXUz6Q,1661572435115,3,0,"I​ was super impressed with this first course when I started it, but I became less satisfied when I progressed into it further.  The quality of the production is amazing and the instructor seems quite good.  It looks like serious effort was put into making this look top notch.  It may be the nicest looking course I've ever taken on Coursera.  M​y criticism is that the course goes from really basic in Week One to very complicated by Week Three.  The videos are accessible at first, but they very quickly get so technical that I had a really tough time following them.  There are so many technical terms introduced in so little time that it's really hard to keep track of any of it.  Since the quizzes mostly ask questions about the technical vocabulary introduced, they are very frustrating.  I have some experience with other programming languages and IDEs and I found this extremely difficult to follow.  O​verall, the course just overloads you with so much information so fast that you can't absorb it.  It almost feels as if a technical manual is being read to you--everything is there but it's not presented in a way that feels meaningful. You can pass by simply retaking the quizzes until you get the answers right, but you won't feel like you really understand anything. I think they needed a fourth week and to just spread out the material a bit more.  The first course in a specialization like this needs to be more accessible.  There are also a few errors in the quizzes that need to be corrected.  ",0,4,Richard Creek,106759622

I also saw a few typos here and there that I feel should have been fixed before posting the course to the public.
