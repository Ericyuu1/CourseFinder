105044751~COURSE!~mzD-aSOFEeW5Rwo0txKkgQ,1656112074709,1,0,"T​he course is really poor. Professor does not clarify passages and actually he uses a very peculiar approach  to Acoustic (that is the impedance approach). Without a previous knowledge of the topic, the lessons are completely unclear. (a lot of math, that is fine! no problem with this. But many concepts are not explained, no mention on Fourier transform...). More over, it is clear that lessons come from a previous course and there are a lot of missing parts.  I passed the final exam (no difficult) but overall really bad experience!",0,1,Riccardo Wanke,105044751

24894076~COURSE!~mzD-aSOFEeW5Rwo0txKkgQ,1543868412284,1,0,"The course uses videos with powerpoint displays within the video. Often the contents of the Powerpoint is not visually clear (ie too small to make out). You cannot download these powerpoints. My last straw was when I encountered a powerpoint (lecture 1 part 2 around 16:45 mins) when the video skips a section of the powerpoint slide. This meant that there is a reference to an equation which one has not seen. This is not just frustrating, but incredibly poor production. In maths/physics references to equations, eg Z, is meaningless unless you know what Z is!! Furthermore the lecturer refers to his textboook where "" ... the derivation of the equation is shown"" - the book incidentally is over GBP50! Don't waste your time on this risible course. Either find another decent MOOC from someone else or buy a book.",0,3,Shanta Perera,24894076

Useful course not only for however want to learn acoustics but also for who want to better understand many different topics of physics. Some problems with the final test of each week, sometimes questions are not clear. I would emphasize more on what is the meaning of a negative reflectance as it had been a question mark for too long time.

The focus is more towards the practical aspects of Acoustics and Prof.Yang- Hann Kim manages to effortlessly connect formulas to intuition- this is indeed remarkable. The theoretical, math-intensive part is left for interested learners, which is also appreciable.
