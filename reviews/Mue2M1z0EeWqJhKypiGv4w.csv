2938830~COURSE!~Mue2M1z0EeWqJhKypiGv4w,1476409182813,2,0,It seems like the course loses its focus about on-half of the way through. It stops being about music and suddenly becomes a discussion about liberal social issues.  I completely lost interest in it at that point.,0,0,Dale D. Hanson,2938830

8428312~COURSE!~Mue2M1z0EeWqJhKypiGv4w,1477187457657,4,0,"Loved the outline of the various areas where music has a strong effect: body, mind, psyche, relationships, community, and culture. I really enjoyed the videos by Dr. McFerrin. She provides excellent overviews of the issues at hand. I also loved learning about the different perspectives coming from presenters from all over the world. This really enriched the overview of research in the field. I would have given it 5 stars except for the fact that the title is very general and therefore a bit misleading. This course has a very strong Musical Therapy slant which is not obvious from the title. I was expecting to learn more about the scientific research about music on the general population (similar to Amelia Collins' approach or the research in Stacy Horn's book ""Imperfect Harmony"", not in a therapeutic setting. Anyway, if the organisers change the title then participants will know better what to expect. ",0,0,Lorraine Manifold,8428312
