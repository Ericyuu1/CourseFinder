55996128~COURSE!~Jq9kYU-sEeuN9A5_DsIBjQ,1632600163232,1,0,"I completed all assessments on the Stepik website for the Week 1, but still the coursera page didn't allow to proceed saying I have to complete the Chapter 1 assessment. The fact is that the course on stepik website had no assessments in Chapter 1, but Chapter 2.The stepik website further forced the audience to register and use another website called Galaxy. Seems like a dirty trick of these developers to make the audience use their trashy developments on our expenses $$$ Coursera, kindly grow some balls to do a business of education honestly. Without cheating paid course audiences.",0,0,Sunil Kumar Nayak,55996128
