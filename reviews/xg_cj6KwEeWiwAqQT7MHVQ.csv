12434338~COURSE!~xg_cj6KwEeWiwAqQT7MHVQ,1471890297562,4,0,"I would definitely recommend this course to anyone at all in the professional world. It is thought-provoking, varied, insightful and full of real-life examples. There was a decent amount of content to get through each week but this was broken up into manageable chunks. Interviews with a range of mature professionals were utilised, offering a range of perspectives and professional experiences. The use of peer group assessment was also very positive - firstly it meant that you actually had to complete the assignments set, unlike other courses on coursera, and it also gave you a sense of being part of a learning community, as well as gaining perspectives from other participants on the course.",0,0,Hermione Fricker,12434338

8271488~COURSE!~xg_cj6KwEeWiwAqQT7MHVQ,1655199661203,5,0,I don't like the peer review assignments. Students don't really have the experience to grade. Peer reviewed assignments make student depended on the whims of other students for the completion of a course. Besides there are technical difficulties. Often you submit your assignment only to find out weeks later that your peers cannot see it.  Then you have to do gymnastics such as copying and pasting your assignment link to the discussion forum just in hopes that someone will grade your assignment.,0,0,Constantinos Paizanis,8271488
