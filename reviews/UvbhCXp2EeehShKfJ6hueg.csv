The subtitles are not going to be useful, and you will not be able to complete assignments unless you understand both languages (simultaneously).  Some of the assignment is in Chinese and some parts contain propaganda related to China, which you may want to be aware of.  The lecturer speaks English with a Chinese accent, which is fine, but there are spelling errors in the text and questions, making me question the quality of the course material.   All assignments must be submitted on time. Students are at the mercy of their peers in peer review which may or may not happen, making one anxious if the course will ever end.

41347832~COURSE!~UvbhCXp2EeehShKfJ6hueg,1598929811144,1,0,"This review is not about the course itself, but the following phrase of the teacher ""  ... a French translator named Gilles Ménage, formed the phrase, les belles infidèles, beautiful but unfaithful woman [FOREIGN}.To describe beautiful but faithful translation. Do we love women who are beautiful but not faithful or do we love women who are faithful but not beautiful?"" The teacher's comment is derogatory, stigmatizing towards women. To an equal degree of absurdity, it has zero context as even the interpretation of the french text is inaccurate. It is a discriminatory statement and should be removed for the purposes of education.Secondly, the phrases 'les belles infidèles"" is a poetic rhyme, the phrase in itself is unfaithful to the meaning, as it is a game of words. In French, Spanish, Portuguese our nouns and adjectives are feminine or masculine. In 'les belles infideles"" just as it stands with no surrounding context, the writer does not make it clear who is unfaithful, he plays and sensualizes the rhyme but he could be talking about: words, women, flowers, clouds, stars as all of these words are feminine and any of these words could complete the sentence. Personally, I interpret the phrase, ""les belles infideles"" just as it stands, that the poet is referring to the beautiful unfaithful - words - not beautiful women - that is a rudimentary analysis of the text. Poets tend to use female nature to sensualize text and color the meanings, nevertheless poets have never been famous for being factual.A horrible choice of comment from the teacher about women,- Do we love women who are beautiful but not faithful or do we love women who are faithful but not beautiful? - it should be removed.

My biggest complaint about this course is that it is listed as a beginners course and requires only 3-5 hours per week of study. This is only true if you are fluent in both English and Chinese and well read with a large vocabulary in both languages. I have been studying Mandarin for over four years and have learned to an intermediate level, yet some weeks I had to spend 30 or more hours per week on assignments. One more area that could be improved are the content of the assignments. Some of them were very hard to understand even in our mother tongue and were taken out of context. A translator would always have the context of what they are translating and would likely have access to the entire work.
