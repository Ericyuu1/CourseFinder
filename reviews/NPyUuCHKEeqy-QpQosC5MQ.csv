This course add great value in performing six sigma (Operational excellence: Manufacturing (distriution, histogram, hypothesis) & Quality (Process capaility, control chart) , DOE (R & D experiment) & Predictive analysis: Forecast in data analytics. It gives exposure to wide range of Industrial prolem, which we face in routine. The handson has given me more confidence in cracking industrial issues.  The learning could e employed on any statistical software for ex: Python, R, Graphpad, Minitab, SPSS Etc. The course addressed another issue as i had not completed my six sigma course (Which are expensive & doesn't really address unless you solve range of practical problem). Also data visualization for Heatmap, Bubble chart could Be very useful in enterprise risk management.",0,1,Manish Biyani,29729176
