33417521~COURSE!~r9tgXtG-Eeaj-w5MxjdpNA,1526788082291,1,0,"I felt that this course was mis-labeld or mis-advertised.  The purpose for which I took this course was to learn how to communicate better in business presentations.  The first part of this course seemed more like Social Psychology 101, and there was not very much effort to relate what the content was to a business environment.  The few examples that were there to give business context I felt were rather un-ethical and in my view promoted an unhealthy business attitude.  I didn't agree with the instructors points on a few things, most notably that threats are a valid option on a business environment.  In my opinion the use of threats is a last resort and should not be encouraged except in extreme circumstances.  And this was the longest lesson which makes it sounds like the most important part of the whole thing - which in my mind puts the focus of a business mindset in completely the wrong place.Overall, I found this course to be very basic and in some cases downright insulting and counter to my personal ethics.In re-reading the syllabus - I can see how it can be described like it is - however for the ""who should take this course "" section you need to add - people who want to understand the psycology of basic communication principles"" - for which this is probably a great course - but for myself - who have been in the business world for 20+ years and who was looking for some help tot get to the next level this was not it.",0,21,tracy,33417521

While these are useful lessons for circumstances that are combative, I don't think these reflect the day-to-day communication I have in my current job and the presumption of bad faith in communication can lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy that can be detrimental to one's career.

After reading at least abstract and discussion / conclusion of most of his paper (and with some already quite a lot more) published after 2000, I noticed that this course really does distill his work quite well. A lot of the practical implications can be learned in this course and whoever wants to dive deeper has his papers, for free.I found most inspiring so far that negotiator self-efficacy moderates negative effects of anxiety on negotiator behavior (Schweitzer et al., 2009), which very much motivates me on learning even more about negotiations than learned in this course already. Apparently, University of Michigan just started offering a specialization on Coursera.Working in the Customer Service Industry I found the whole course very illuminating. I use some of the concepts already but learning about context and theory behind them certainly will aid me in further developing on my tactics and influencing others in my company so that we can offer better service to our customers.Thank you Prof. Schweitzer, University of Pennsylvania and everybody involved.
