998953~COURSE!~gOzEQgG5EeuNpwrWxPimUQ,1606478389350,1,0,"Super disappointing. Reeks of bias and lack of objectivity. Within the first minutes of introduction lecturers exposed few of their biases. Lack of forum where students could ask questions is also disappointing.. i remember previous courses I participated in had forums.  For a truly enlightening course where you actually get exposed to thinking and not indoctrination, check out the most popular course in the history of Harvard, Justice Harvard, Michael Sandel. And then imagine if Stanford lecturers applied similar pedagogical method to their determined views on the topic. Btw, how come they claim elections are secure when Dominion voting system was declined in numerous states due to security issues, yet enabled in dozens of other states? Interesting.
