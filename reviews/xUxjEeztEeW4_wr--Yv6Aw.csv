17419947~COURSE!~xUxjEeztEeW4_wr--Yv6Aw,1479684053103,4,0,"A good introductory course to AR. In some parts of the course, the lectures go over the code for an extended period of time jumping across different lines of code and it is quite hard to keep track of this. Thankfully, the transcript helps. However, it would be better to explain the code in templates or another way which makes it easier to learn. Overall, this course is definitely recommended to understand the basics of AR.",0,0,Amrutraj Uppala,17419947

Week 5 went really very fast. Would ask other people to get some basic idea of VRML by the time you are doing this course.

Its well structured, for starters like myself, and provides an initial AR experience using authoring tool to understand. Later, how to further code without authoring tool. In fact, I have developed interest in creating an augmented book using GPAC, adding 3D objects (W.I.P). I strongly recommend this course. ",0,0,arulvenugopal,18397483

21197287~COURSE!~xUxjEeztEeW4_wr--Yv6Aw,1488348329938,5,0,"This was the first found by me AR course (I was seaking others but they were theoritical) that teaches you how do the things by your own hands.  I am writing this review a half year after completing it, being invited to become a mentor, comlpeting the course for mentors and starting to help online to the instructors. It is  a pleasure to see how the things happens, especially if you are not an ICT specialist. If you overcome the stress from the first meeting with the code in the second week, you would be able to complete the course.  But you should devote enought time to do the practical tasks. I am not an ICT specialist. In the real life I am an architect. Honestly to say, in beginning I was doing for some hours the things that were sceduled for 10 minutes. Shame or not, my first meeting with the code took me 4 hours, then 3, 2, one, and in the last weeks I was able to complete the tasks for the recommended time. The instructors  upload examples and the students their work in a gallery, done especially for this course http://www.mymultimediaworld.com/projects_gallery/ .  I am writing this review to say thank you to the instructors for revealing the process of creating  AR in real. I would be happy if more people  start to use this technology. This course will help you to do your initial steps to this. ",0,1,Nadya Stamatova,21197287
