1055353~COURSE!~OpTzUED0EeusyQ4n_00ahw,1612123671248,4,0,"Really nice intro into VMs.  Like how the course offers a light comparison of Google, Amazon, and Microsoft cloud computing.  An opportunity for future updates to the course:  add some side notes on how to perform these same tasks for setting up a Windows VM and Linux VM on Azure from a Mac.  When instructed to download and open the RDP file, I had to go outside of the course to figure that out which added an extra couple of hours of searching and making mistakes.
