The second half of the course was increasingly theoretical, with a lot of papers being listed as reading material. The quizzes pose quite detailed questions about the papers - It would require a lot of memorization to answer all of them without looking up the papers again. As there are a lot of references to other sources and institutions, if this field interests you, you will be handed enough information so you know where to turn to after the course. 
As VR is a fast-paces area with a lot of development in a short time span, some of the course content might become outdated soon, so consider this when you want to take it (If you're reading this in 2024,it's probably too old).",0,0,Antonia T,88825

39654771~COURSE!~1ic9zoLdEemHmA6aH8Ctzg,1602613584650,4,0,"I finished the course and I can say I am glad I took it. I'll make a quick summarize of my impressions. Hope they are useful for instructors and future students:

Week 1 is a fast overview of anatomical terminology, a little bit of general physiology and a little bit of history. It was good to refresh some concepts I had forgotten. 
Week 2 is where they talk about 3D- modelling softwares and terminology and is when you are taught to use Blender. I liked the videos (though one of them appeared small on screen). They were very well explained. However, as they say, they are only introductory. We go straight to the point to create the femur model. Anyway, the articles were awesome and informative.
Week 3 and 4 are specifcally about VR,MR,AR and, in general, ER. You learn a lot about the terminology used in the field, the vast amount of applications there are, the institutions, companies and projects that have been developing such incredible technologies, biomedical-related ER technology and its limitations, advantages, disadvantages, challenges, etc. You will end up with a very valuable idea of the state of the art in these fields.

So, summarizing, I finished with a much clearer idea of the state of the art of ER in biomedical areas, which is extraodinary. The most valuable things for me were the informative and interesting articles shared and the small introduction to Blender software, but mostly the articles. The video lectures are also amazing. Short (except one of them) but concise and very interesting.
What I didn't like was that you are not taught to do a simple animation in Blender. I thought it was going to be there in week 2, but it wasn't. That's the only thing that let me down a little. But only a little. The rest of the course was so enriching.

TO THE INSTRUCTORS:
I would love to see the Master in coursera, or at least a much more extended course. I would buy it immediately. So, I encourage you to consider making an online version of the master, or a specialization. I know the master is unique in the world, and therefore so special, but please consider this.
Thanks for the small window you open for us to see and explore the paradise that's there outside. I now know what to keep studying: extended realities for visualization and interaction. I feel more motivated to do it. I am amazed for the things we can create. This is a passionate field you helped me discover.",0,1,Eduardo Quintanar,39654771

5004071~COURSE!~1ic9zoLdEemHmA6aH8Ctzg,1593160606627,4,0,"This was a rollercoaster ride, honestly. The weeks differ in quality to a bewildering extent, with week 1 being a mellow start that almost made me question my enrollment, Week 2 (Hands on with Blender), Week 3 's recordings and some of Week 4's writings being peak experience, and everything else, regrettably, being either okay to genuinely bad.Case in point: The first time you see that there's a 1 hour long Keynote speech and a 37 minute podcast, you might do what I did and groan. But now that I am done with the course, I wish those had been longer.I've never done a course that left me feeling so... simultaneously pumped and unsatisfied! At the end of the course, Dr. Paul has a bit where he talks about the MSc in Visualization and Human Anatomy, and the structure of that course would lend itself incredibly well to a specialization here on Coursera. Course 1 - Anatomy (an expanded version of Week 1)Course 2 - Visualization technology (expanding the hands on Blender experience of Week 2)Course 3 - All the AR and VR stuff from the remaining 2 weeks with less articles (or more expert summaries)Course 4 - An actual project to make an animation / app with what we learned in Course 1 and 2. This should be trivial to accomplish by making us build up to it from the previous courses.Pipe dreams perhaps, but hey, I can't be the only one looking up random articles on VR and prowling around on the University of Glasgow's Sketchfab page at this point.Overall, I highly recommend this course just because it is very intellectually stimulating, but I'd love to see more of this!
