25842501~COURSE!~WZylFHqhEeatXAptp9b5_w,1496635486246,1,0,"For the ""Three good things"" exercise, I got a failing grade from peers, which i feel is not justified. I felt that ""sharing the experience applying the exercise"" was more
important than just listing the three things every day, but the peer that reviewed my assignment didn't agree. 
















I
didn't write down exactly what I said each day, though I did the exercise and
said so. I also had a personal reflection about the exercise, which I thought
through carefully, and which I felt really showed how I understood the purpose
of the exercise. I don't think it was expressly said clearly enough when the
assignment was set that all we needed to do was list the three things daily, and
talk about why they were good. I don't really think that that is the basis of
the exercise or the course, especially when I had a deeply personal reflection of the
exercise. If all we need to do is list things, then I think it's a useless
exercise, which doesn't really lead to personal insight. I could go back and
redo the assignment, just listing things, but I don't think that's a really
useful thing to do. 



Also, I
don't think it makes sense to explain why the good things happen each
day...they just happen, and we notice them! There is no ""why""...if we
notice a beautiful sunset, there is no ""reason"" to explain why it
happened. I wouldn't know what to say that would make a peer feel like I had a good ""reason"" to explain why the good things happened. If I need to go back and just make a silly list, and try to explain the inexplicable, just to pass the course, I will do so, but I don't feel that it really gets to the heart of what the exercise was attempting to have us realize and work through. The rest of the course has been wonderful, and I've really been enjoying it, this is the first thing that I'm not really happy with.Thank you, Elayne Ras
