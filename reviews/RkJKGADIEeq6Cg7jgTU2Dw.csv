79554728~COURSE!~RkJKGADIEeq6Cg7jgTU2Dw,1616261461498,2,0,"This course has excellent material, and as usual for all Coursera instructors that I have experienced so far (and for Laurence Moroney specifically) the instructor is extremely qualified, sincere, engaged, and tries to pack a ton of information into his/her course.The reason I rated this course as a two star, was in hopes that it might stand out and the two suggestions below might get heard more (as I do very much think they would help).  I hope that this rating won't hurt Laurences overall rating, as I assume he has thousands of high ratings to outweigh this one rating.  If it does, please change the rating to 4 star.Hear are my two suggestions:(1) Point 1 -- Two many screen shots with just code!  I believe Laurence is trying to pack as much info as he can into the course, and I do sincerely appreciate the detail and the specific code/how-tos/answers.  But after a while, it is very close to experiencing ""death by power-point"".  Especially, since we don't get copies of these lectures after our month subscription (that is a super bummer)!  There is no way we can remember all this detail anyway (without working with this stuff), or  we pause and write it all down.  The super detailed notebooks are wonderful and repeat all this info anyway.  I would much prefer to be able to keep the notebooks (if we can after class).  My recommendation/suggestion in this case would be to at least add more animation to code slides.  In Andrew Ng's presentations, he walks you through all the steps, in many cases hand-writing out the math first.  This would not be practical in this course, but there are cases, where Laurence high-lights the line of code he is talking about about.  Much more of that is NEEDED.  In fact it would be helpful to overlay arrows (as well) that show how parameters and arguments flow from one statement to the next in the code.  You might think this is not necessary (as Laurence is very detailed in his explanations and that should be sufficient).  But he does talk quickly, and it would be super helpful in not getting lost, and also in breaking up the eventual monotony that can set in with too many slides of just ""code and talk"". Again the material is great, but the presentation is too much repetition of code and talk/explanation.  If he were to tie it together better with more highlighted boxes an arrows connecting the flow (as Andrew Ng does in his presentations), I think that (or something similar) would help a lot.(2) Point 2 -- You may disagree, but it I believe this is very important/helpful.  I am not a fan of disease based presentations when learning.  I know this subject is relevant to many apps, datasets,  study and research today, but when you are trying to learn a new subject, it is fun (or helpful) to have to be looking at a bunch stats on diseases, which is a subject that can engender or call up fear in the audience. Subject matter that is neutral and not related to health problems is kinder to the learner/audience (imo).  I would recommend avoiding lessons and topics on subjects that can engender or call up fear during the lesson.  There are plenty other datasets (that you use) that are not focus on such domains/subjects.",0,0,David Neubert,79554728
