The material was very dense in places and certain steps were taken with limited explanation. For example -- I still am not sure on the subtleties of calculating impulses and momentum equations due to the fact that the use of the center of the bar moment of intertia vs. end of the bar was not ever addressed with which R to use in calculating the momentum (and why that r even exists in momentum). I think that the diagrams are based on the impulse momentum, and then we calculate the diagrams and other items separate from that, but honestly, there were many of these areas where I struggled to follow a sudden jump in the lectures.",0,0,Brian Parrott,13030440
