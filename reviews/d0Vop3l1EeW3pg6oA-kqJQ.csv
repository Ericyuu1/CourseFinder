I have only one quiz left and on November 23, a deadline suddenly came, despite the fact that I devoted a lot of time to the course and in fact completed it in two days. I have completely closed all 6 courses for specialization except for one quiz of 6 questions in week 4. Now someone has decided that the next set is only in half a year, seriously? All I need is to go through an automatic check of 6 questions without human control and get my cherished certificate. But it turns out that I wasted money? What is worth extending the course? I cannot wait that long and pay extra money. Could the moderators somehow influence this by informing people who can help?",0,2,Евгений Семченко,69506963

There isn't a lot of teaching content because it's supposed to be simulating a real-life project. I personally am not interested in bioinfometrics and string assembly, so I don't feel very motivated.I am happy that I have finished this course and I have learned a lot. I also honed my C++ skills through the many programming assignments; this is one of the reasons I decided to take this over other specializations. The main reason for the 3 stars is that I could have spent the same amount time to learn more about algorithms, instead of thinking about problems I am not particularly interested.

4016226~COURSE!~d0Vop3l1EeW3pg6oA-kqJQ,1528477938065,3,0,"I did not enjoy this course. I did not like the following things:1) It was advertizing a different course (Bioinformatics or something like that) too hard for my taste.2) The problem statements were often incorrect. In particular what is related to the size of inputs. I have wasted too much time because of these issues. For example, the problem statement says that there will be 400 lines of input. After wasting an hour and a half trying to find a cause of a segmentation error I am reading on the forum a message THAT IS ONE YEAR OLD saying that there are in fact 1618 lines of input.3) The final problem (genome assembler) has a very tight memory limit if you consider the size of the input. Solving it within the memory limit would require special skills that are not covered by the material in this course. Or maybe I (and other people on the forum) are just not smart enough.4) There are almost no lectures.

While I definitely learned a lot during that process, it would have been really helpful to have more active instructor engagement and feedback (although I realize that this may not be possible when an official course session is not in progress, which is when the bulk of my work for this course took place).I also think many of the problem statements could have been more clearly defined. For example, I spent a lot of time on the ""Bubble detection"" problem constructing graphs that allowed for multiple edges between two nodes, when it turned out that in order to pass I did not need to implement this.That being said, I've learned a lot from the courses in this specialization, and thanks for the work put into it!",0,1,Sabina Sloman,14016512

However, the problem sets in this programming challenge are often not so well-defined, which makes it really difficult to solve (especially the dataset problem). The solution of the problems usually turns out to be quite simple, but is not applicable to a large set of problems, only to the particular dataset that is given (and the characteristics of this dataset is not given; so I end up thinking about all possibilities that might occur for that dataset, which makes the problem more difficult). The examples given in the problem set are also not sufficient to describe the characteristics of the problem clearly.

Disclaimer: I didn't implement the very final task, the genome assembler, but solved all the rest of the problems. I'm not sure if anyone has finished that task though, judging from forum feedback.You're on your own here about how you approach the problems, although there is some nice supplemental material available in the form of introductory videos and a booklet walking you through the project. In the forums, you'll find some breadcrumbs of information, but often there's no single 'best solution' - you can choose your own approach. There's less information available than for other problems in the specialization but they are passable if you use common sense and read the supplemental material.I really felt that everything learnt before in this specialization just came together nicely here: thinking about solution approaches and algorithmic complexity, researching material, methodically building complex programs, reusing bits and pieces of earlier problem solutions (like graphs, network flows), and of course lots of stress testing and bug hunting. Few things are more rewarding than submitting your stress tested solution and having it pass right away!The instructor, Pavel Pevzner is a recognized bioinformatician in this field, and actually has credit in developing this kind of genome assembly using De Bruijn graphs.
