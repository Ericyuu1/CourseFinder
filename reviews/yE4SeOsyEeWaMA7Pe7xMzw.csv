101466~COURSE!~yE4SeOsyEeWaMA7Pe7xMzw,1519551688104,1,0,"I wasn't very happy.The subject material was very shallow; brief overviews of some aspects of the material with repeated references to ""suggested materials"" that didn't actually exist.Even at the level of detail presented, there was a lot of info on slides that did not appear in the transcripts.  It would have been useful to have the slides be downloadable.I didn't like the design of the quizzes; this might be a coursera thing (I've seen the same thing in other classes), but the inclusion of 5 subparts of a one-point question meant no ""partial credit"", making a ""5-question"" quiz (with 20-odd things to get wrong/right) a lot more difficult to pass than they should have been.  (In other MOOCs, I've seen such multi-part questions handled by having the question as a whole be worth 5 points (for a 5-subpart question), and you get a point awarded for each subpart you get right, and not awarded for each one you get wrong (whether it should have been checked and wasn't or should have been not-checked and was.)There was no interaction with ""staff"" on the class forums.  The ""extra thought"" topics were simplistic and only barely related to the class materials, and the participation that happened was ... poor, like people thought they were getting points for ""taking part"" even if all they said was ""I don't know.""The professor seemed to have some strong opinions about ""controversial"" subjects, presented as facts, that I happen to disagree with, and didn't really have any supporting material.  (The big one for me was ""FPGAs are lower power than MCUs.""  Which I asked about on the forums, and was never answered.   But also several several cases of ""the advantage of XX os is that it has small memory requirements"", followed nearly immediately by several examples of other OSes described as even smaller.)Finally, for a 4-week class where the first 3 weeks have only short quizzes, I thought the ""week 4"" assignment: ""download a VM and set up Contiki/cooja, write two programs and get them both peer reviewed by the end of the week"" was unrealistic.  Especially without ""supported matierals"", tutorials on setup, or even copies of the sketchy  instructions on the slides in the video.  (I might not have been awful, given an extra week to complete.  I gave up, though.)  (existing forum message from a prior iteration of the class says ""don't use contiki 3.0 like the instructor talks about, or even 2.7 that he mentions.

If you know nothing about embedded system:  Probably you are to feel a little bit effort and you're going to make a hard effort to understand something.  Classes will be like "" In the world there are processors, microcontroller, FPGA, ASIC and they have certain things(SRAM, peripherals, etc) and then you use them to build aerospace avionics, good look.   _______________________________________________________________    ImprovementThe course should use more drawings ( flowchart, diagram), it would be much more understandable. Too many topics you can't bring to the real world.The course has a nice tittle. But, I wish this course was seperated in longer modules or courses, because there are too many topics for very few time... so you wont learn anything really solid.for instance:  1- Designing embedded - Raise requirements for project based on real project ( eg. temperature and humidity sensor to work battery powered, show information in a display the information of temp and humidity. Must be reliable, safe, low power consumption ) and so on. Learn how to search for components, price, availability, datasheet.2 - FPGA -  How to implement  the project above using a platform ( or at least simulation). Program in VHDL or Verilog.3 - Processor -  ...4 - MCU - ...5 - Building firmware in C - Develop firmware without OS. Use state machines of things like that6 -  Build firmware with an OS.7 - Drawing PCB  - Ariiise board!!!So, I just gave an idea I do not know how difficult would it be to bring to reality",0,6,Joao Paulo,2551086
