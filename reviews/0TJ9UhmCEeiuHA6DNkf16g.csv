82029593~COURSE!~0TJ9UhmCEeiuHA6DNkf16g,1643259775779,1,0,"This course is not worth your time. It lacks a coherent structure. If you take this course, be prepared to read a collection of articles that marginally relate to the topics and to watch a disjointed series of badly produced videos. The quizzes are written in such poor English that it is nearly impossible to answer the questions correctly.",0,1,Adam Ravitch,82029593

21431002~COURSE!~0TJ9UhmCEeiuHA6DNkf16g,1531214029649,5,0,"At first I was afraid that this would be a course on the boring part of technology, but it is not. It is an interesting course on standardisation in technology, showing the historical impact of standardisation while focussing on the newest developments of autonomous driving and privacy. I can now see how standardisation will have a huge impact on how companies like Facebook can be regulated, but also how valuable it is to try to set a standard and increase the impact of technological innovations on the world.",0,0,Martijn Test Klabbers,21431002
