It covers a good range of the fundamentals so someone completely new to VR is probably going to benefit the most. As a ""power user"" myself, but not at all a developer, I also learned  enough to consider it valuable. One problem is that the instructors don't tell from when a particular piece of text was written, which is very important in a field like VR which is rapidly and constantly evolving. They provide a blog on medium to provide some of the content up to date. Then there's the usual problems with MOOCs: not being able to get in contact with the instructors, having a lot and lot of the participating peers being ignorant and not taking it seriously at all.

39330929~COURSE!~pXYrg_jbEeaRvRLVBNP8Xg,1549582340100,4,0,"I audited this course for Professional Development from February 1st, 2019 through February 7th, 2019. For reference, I have a Bachelor's degree in Psychology and a Master's degree in Communication Studies where I completed some research (though unpublished) in virtual reality. Overall, this course took me about three hours per completion week outside of some of the larger readings which took longer. I completed all activities available via audit (even if I couldn't submit them) and read all readings except for a few journal articles that seemed to repeat themselves. I'll complete a week by week breakdown and then provide my thoughts about the course overall.For week one, I thought it was a nice introduction to various head-mounted displays on the consumer market. Additionally, there was a nice overview of the history of virtual reality which included some research devices I had not seen previously. Fun fact, this is the only week you will see Dr. Gillies in this course.For week two, there is a breakdown of all the different ways virtual reality is helping in contemporary society today (from sports to science to medical improvements). The final reading in this week is a great piece by Mel Slater describing everything from the first two weeks and most content from the third week. While certainly not a ten minute read as described, I would recommend this week for this reading along.For week three, it is easily the most material of the entire course. Mel Slater comes as a guest professor to describe presence, immersion, embodiment, place illusion, and plausibility illusion. Dr. Slater seemed like a great fit, and the only complaint about this week was the fact that readings were academic research papers that had seemingly already been described (such as the one from week two). Additionally, these readings were described as ten minute assignments which was not the case.Lastly, for week four, there is a shift to the development side of virtual reality. There is a large focus on graphic development and issues one may face while programming for virtual reality today.Looking over the course as a whole, here are the positives: I found I had learned more than I knew coming into the course. This course specifically can be completed by those interested in social science as well as those interested in development as there is a larger focus on Psychology and theories in the field of virtual reality. I thoroughly enjoyed hearing from Dr. Slater and his thoughts on the psychology of virtual reality as well as the illusions he showed.Dr. Sylvia Pan had good content and was involved in almost every video.Here are the negatives: There were times I could see a large emphasis on CAVEs over other types of virtual reality, though I believe this to be due to the creator's own expertise.Marco Gillies seemed to be very little involved with this particular course.There were some grammatical errors in questions provided during lecture videos, and the answers are not examined by instructors. It is an auto-generated response so that it feels as those you are not receiving actual feedback.Questions during lecture videos often pop up immediately after that information is covered, leading to parroting the answer back when asked about it.Readings are all described as ten minutes, but some take hours while others take three minutes or thirty seconds. It is very inconsistent.It appears most individuals audit this course, so those who are paying fill the discussion forums begging those who pay to review their work for the certificate completion before being charged again.Some videos focus on the specialization and do not describe the course as an individual unit making the content confusing.Overall, I would recommend this course. For those brand new to the subject, be aware there is peer-reviewed academic reading for this course. For some people, that alone can be a turn-off. For those fine with that content, I would spend about an hour a day on the content and you could have it completed within a few weeks time.",0,10,Alexander Stevens,39330929

Of an introductory course you would expect a listing and shallow description of applications, software and hardware. I was pleasantly surprised to see that this course goes well beyond that.

I feel like I have just gotten the benefit of a veteran programmers retrospect on the industry. Very cool. One thing I would suggest... splitting part of week 3 into week 4... week 3 was fairly heavy compared to the others... though I certainly understand the desire to group that specific material together. I would also suggest changing the assignments to be specific to one type of VR each... HMD or 360 Video. It would help people think out use cases in both spaces. ,0,0,James McDermott,435174
