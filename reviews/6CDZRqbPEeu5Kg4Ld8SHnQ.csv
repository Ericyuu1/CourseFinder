Although I did put in the effort to respond to the discussion prompts, it is good they were optional, since there wasn't any discussion. Likewise with the peer reviewed assignments. I have to say that they were very confusing as to exactly what we were supposed to do. It would have been a great idea to practice what I was learning, but I wasn't sure whether I was supposed to be evaluating and documenting the learning environment as is, or whether I was supposed to assume it hadn't been built yet. I probably chose the wrong approach. The assignments definitely need clarification, especially if they are eventually graded.",0,0,Catherine Beise,678270
