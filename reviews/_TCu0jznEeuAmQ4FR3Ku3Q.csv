4733371~COURSE!~_TCu0jznEeuAmQ4FR3Ku3Q,1614793536707,1,0,"Being an avid Coursera student, I am disappointed in this course. One could easily register in Miro and go through the steps on their own with the same learning effect. I did not learn anything new and the few pictures used in the course do not have a quality good enough that you can actually use them for reference in other projects. It is really a pity.",0,0,Maria JÃºlia Clark Reis,4733371
