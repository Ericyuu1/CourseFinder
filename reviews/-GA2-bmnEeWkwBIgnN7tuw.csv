1162387~COURSE!~-GA2-bmnEeWkwBIgnN7tuw,1524825892144,2,0,"If you like learning labels and definitions, this is a great course. If you want to learn about how to create community change, skip it.The course focuses on defining communities and types of change, which it does very well. However, be aware that it does not cover how to create this change, except with the most cursory of references. I found the assessments (which require you to define various parts of a community and change processes) monotonous, especially as you must complete the same assessment questions twice. Neither myself nor anyone I peer-graded agreed with the course creators on which labels to use for the case studies, so I wonder how useful they are as learning points.Finally, I was disappointed that the course focuses on a handful of stereotypical communities and change programs (e.g. HIV, malaria, and clean water in Africa). It is difficult to relate the material to other community contexts, such as Western or developed ones.",0,0,Katherine Garzonis,1162387

I realize that this course was filmed a while ago when focusing on communities in Africa was and they still are a priority. As I live in a very large urban city in the US and I am taking not only this course but the Foundations of Global Health during a SARS-COV2 pandemic I am looking at it through that lens. It would be nice if this could be updated to include the COVID-19 pandemic ,0,0,Myrna Pietri,27474772
