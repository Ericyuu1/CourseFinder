And I had to find errors in my package by sending a lot of combinations of my tests to the grader. The most unobvious error in the buggy version was four recipes instead of three. It is not an error at all, because in this task we don't have Golden versions or requirements and even installation of CofeeMakerUI was written as if four recipes were a norm (4 recipes in the list).Also, I don't understand why I have so small coverage. Maybe the issue is in the errors from mutant versions. On my computer coverage was higher than 90% in all checked classes.",0,0,Typical User,76122095
