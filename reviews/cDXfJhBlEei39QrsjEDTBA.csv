Unfortunately, it's difficult to actually obtain the certification. Waiting for others to review your assignment takes aggressive campaigning on the Discussion Forums. Even after getting graded, I still don't have my certificate.  Right now, it's June of 2022. The instructor is on paternity leave through December of 2022 -- great for his baby; not so great for his Coursera students. It is unclear if he has a backup to handle queries. Therefore, I deducted a star or two. If I get my certificate in a timely manner, I will change my rating.As far as content of the course, it's good, although very engineering-oriented. I felt that I was able to complete the assignments because I have a good grasp of math and logic, plus 25+ years of Excel and VBA experience under my belt. I was surprised that some debugging tools like the Immediate Window and debug.print statements were completely overlooked, but it is possible to code without them.  Information on the 'Personal Macro Workbook' would be helpful in an introductory course. There are a number of things that aren't covered in this course, however, it's a good start to Excel/VBA and should lead to more investigation and learning opportunities.

This Specialisation was incredibly useful to me as a novice programmer.  Unlike some of the other free/low cost online content out there on VBA this course is well-structured and rigorous enough to actually gain a solid foundation in programming concepts, and more importantly to be able to apply the material to real world situations.  I've only just completed the course but have already created a couple of macro-based report collation tools at work that have been very well received since they save time and improve accuracy.  I have a couple of other bigger projects I'm now planning at work, which have long been an ambition of mine but out of my league until now. The course really is quite challenging (if you have experience in another program it will probably come much easier for you!) and one really does have to think and try things out in the assignments and later projects to get an outcome - which is important since that's what it'll be like writing VBA in the wild!  The video content is very well presented and well-thought out and Charlie's passion for maths, programming and creative solutions really shone through.  The content is structured logically, with a good progression in difficulty moving along the weeks and parts.Another great thing about this course is that rather than get bogged down in the minutiae of every VBA term/syntax it focuses on broad programming concepts such as loops, iteration, arrays and debugging/problem solving.
