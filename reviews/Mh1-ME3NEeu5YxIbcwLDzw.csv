Details are severaly lacking, and there are many mistakes in the course notebooks.  I don't recommend this course.  Instead look to one given by a reputable university.",0,0,Bob Wooster,22072419
87527803~COURSE!~Mh1-ME3NEeu5YxIbcwLDzw,1626570989982,1,0,Really hard to access and use Databricks. Disappointing that this is my first course on this website. Wouldn't recommend.  Appallingly set out course.  Would give it 0 stars if I could. Beginners stay away!,0,0,Felix Ryan,87527803

87955856~COURSE!~Mh1-ME3NEeu5YxIbcwLDzw,1624246181972,1,0,"Terrible. The worst coursera class I ever took.A) The quizzes contained errors,  incomplete  transformations for solving a problemB)  The prof.  just  showed a page in the book and read from it in a monotonous voice.  In order to understand anything I  actually had to stop video and read this page from the book. B) Prof never actual taught   or explained  anything, but  just glossed over the subject.  This hardly be called ""teaching"" ",0,0,Jaroslav Hook,87955856

Far too many integral signs, and far too few worked practice examples.  I'm hoping the next two in the series are better, and more focused on the practitioner looking to solve business problems.",0,0,"Charles William Cary, III",1850150

21909499~COURSE!~Mh1-ME3NEeu5YxIbcwLDzw,1645893702652,4,0,"Content/notes wise this course is great, But teaching style needs to be improved. Rather than reading the notes instructor should teach by giving examples and driving some of the results.",0,0,Taranpreet singh,21909499
8280481~COURSE!~Mh1-ME3NEeu5YxIbcwLDzw,1636636583805,4,0,Clear explanations with lots of small examples to illustrate the material. The text provided in the slides is interesting but it should just be provided in support of the code and the slides should be used to show visual examples. I still recommend this course.,0,0,stephane degeye,8280481
