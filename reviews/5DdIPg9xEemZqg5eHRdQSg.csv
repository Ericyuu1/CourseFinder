49730725~COURSE!~5DdIPg9xEemZqg5eHRdQSg,1584020238626,3,0,"the course was helpful to me as a primary care physicianHowever, there were at least 2 glaring errors in the presentations.    Because of these errors, I am forced to worry that there were additional mistakes that I didnt catch and that I have been misinformed about some aspect of transgender care.   There were also  a number of typos in the text versions of the oral presentations.   The 2 errors which I spotted were: 1) in the psychiatry presentation, it was stated that the ""rate of suicide"" among transgender people is 40%, and that this is 8X the rate in the general population.  This is a gross overstatement of the suicide rate in the general population, and presumably  apparently also an overstatement of the transgender rate;  I assume the lecturer meant suicide attempts.   2) regarding the possibility of pregnancy in transgender men, the lecturer, Zil Goldstein, suggested that the use of testosterone is not detrimental to the fetus (this may have been implied, rather than stated outright, but it was certainly misleading).   In fact, testosterone definitely has an effect on the fetus, and this should have been discussed.Thank you",0,7,Sharon Schwartz Brooks,49730725
