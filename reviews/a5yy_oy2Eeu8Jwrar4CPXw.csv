13080291~COURSE!~a5yy_oy2Eeu8Jwrar4CPXw,1659700687856,2,0,"Some of the modules are interesting, however, to me the course seems  rather like a more or less uninspirational and random series of video lectures. The didactical elements are not very innovative - online courses can do so much better!  Some of the videos havenÂ´t even been cut properly (the speakers re-start the presentation, but the first intent has not been removed).To me, the title does not describe the content very well (for me, the course is rather about health management instead of entrepreneurship).",0,0,Bernadette Freund,13080291
