Portfolio strategies such as CPPI and LDI are quite important and are introduced fully here. The course however takes a bit long time to finish, if you really want to make the most of it, because you must follow the long-hours labs.

The lab sessions in this course are incredible and serve as a guide to implement techniques learned in the course (and to build on them) on new datasets.

6816670~COURSE!~qeyXSV_uEeiNIQqyU-T6bA,1580070131191,5,0,"This is an excellent course on employing Python to make asset allocation decisions. The concepts are well-explained and the pace is quite brisk. A student can really benefit by following and redoing the Python code themselves. For that, I would highly recommend going through the excellent Numpy, Pandas tutorials on the Enthought youtube channel, before the first week. Secondly, the course expects an understanding of Asset Allocation concepts, and it will be prudent to read up on 'Modern Portfolio Theory: Efficient and Optimal Portfolios' before the second week. I admit that I cannot write the sophisticated code for last modules (Dr.  Vijay Vaidyanathan made it look as effortless as reading a newspaper), but the course has given me the confidence that I can do that after coming up to speed on Python.That is also my suggestion for improving the course that maybe some of the more sophisticated techniques be pushed out to later modules while building up python and asset allocation knowledge in the first module.After finishing the course, it's quite satisfying to examine the mutual fund results, and understand how they were generated or how target date funds work or what's the logic behind the 60/40 asset allocation portfolio.

The lectures are clear and the lab sessions are very helpful to understand concepts and use them by digging into the implementation.
