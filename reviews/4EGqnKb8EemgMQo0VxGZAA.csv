53446551~COURSE!~4EGqnKb8EemgMQo0VxGZAA,1658674869663,1,0,"T​his course is marketed as a course for beginners in Econometrics. I have done my graduation in Economics Honours and hence studied advanced Econometrics. I can testify that this course was difficult for even me to understand. This is not to say, I'm great at the subject, but it's definitely not a beginner or even a medicore level course. I hope we can have more explanation incorporated in the course.

23957645~COURSE!~4EGqnKb8EemgMQo0VxGZAA,1658465077394,1,0,"Good content,Unfortunately, the course has a terrible interface (seems broken) where you don't have acess to the side menue where you can see all the weeks and move through the videos. The only way to go back and forwards through the materia is clicking the previous and next arrows. 

This makes the course somewhat hard to use for review adn interview prep.",0,0,Alejandro Ludert,23957645
22301221~COURSE!~4EGqnKb8EemgMQo0VxGZAA,1591013424098,1,0,I think this course should be for A level or high school students...VERY very basic.,0,0,Nitesh Gautam,22301221
34592404~COURSE!~4EGqnKb8EemgMQo0VxGZAA,1644861090711,2,0,"I appreciate that the author is trying to make eonometrics more accessible, but the course design is in need of serious improvement. The course provides a couple of interesting examples to make the material 'fun',  but it then proceeds to throw equations at you without explaining core concepts or developing any underlying intuition. The discussion prompts also feel like busy-work. To be more effective, the course should be 2-4 times longer, and take more time to explain core concepts in the course of introducing the mathematical notation.",0,1,Scott McFatridge,34592404
41640924~COURSE!~4EGqnKb8EemgMQo0VxGZAA,1670927076579,3,0,"This is a nice course, but it's not for beginners.Before I started this course I looking for some interesting materials in this field.I found this course ""Enjoyable Econometrics"" and thought ""Ok if it's for beginners - it would be nice to start with this one""But... My expectation was wrong. It's too brief course... and I didn't find something enjoyable when I can't understand more than 80% of the materials.Yes, probably it's fun for that kind of person who knows something before it... but for newbies, it's not fun.Concepts of all materials - is a brief review and show you some formulas without explanation - they show you only the results.I won't recommend this course for beginners.Sorry, but ""Erasmus University Rotterdam"" if you want to share your interest in this topic with beginners - you should explain the materials more.",0,1,Roman Vasiura,41640924
90850219~COURSE!~4EGqnKb8EemgMQo0VxGZAA,1636540562621,3,0,Not sure who can benefit from the course.  The techniques used are not really explained only demonstrated. The idea was probably to show  that the uses of econometrics are not limited to economics or finance but there was too little real technical content for the student to take with him moving forward.I do commend the professor for an effort to popularize a very technical field. My conclusion is that I probably need to take the other course offered by him which does go into all the details.,0,2,Pinni Perlmutter,90850219

41195652~COURSE!~4EGqnKb8EemgMQo0VxGZAA,1625304584027,4,0,"This audit-only/no-certificate free course, which I expected to be a casual introduction to econometrics principles for laypeople, is not as enjoyable as I thought it would be. This is especially in the latter half of the material, where barrages of increasingly complicated equations are thrown at you at a quick pace. A way to get something from this course, particularly for non-economics or non-statistics majors like me, hopefully is slow down, pause and/or repeat the videos from time to time. The course assumes a lot that a student should have prior to entering the course such as knowledge of college-level mathematics and statistics. Nevertheless, the value of this course really lies in introducing the learners to the complexity of the field and the real-life necessity to understand such complexity. This course is highly recommended to prospective students of formal economics and/or econometrics courses or formal programs to help them gauge their baseline capacity to thrive in such offerings. I am looking forward to go back to the course materials from time to time should I take comprehensive courses on the field.",0,5,Aedrian Abrilla,41195652
