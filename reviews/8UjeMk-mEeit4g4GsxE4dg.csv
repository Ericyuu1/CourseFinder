My IBM Cloud subscription reached its monthly allotted data allowance and IBM wanted $200 USD to get more space. So I am paying Coursera a monthly fee and then I am being asked for more money from IBM to have the ability to do what Coursera was asking me to do in the course.I​ reached out to the instructor group about this issue and I was told to use the Skills Network Lab. This also cost me time because the Python that worked in IBM Cloud's Data Park did not cleanly line up with the Python version in the Skills Network Lab. This caused me to go back and rewrite portions of my final assignment. Again, costing me time for things that are not in my control.M​y monthly fee to Coursera should be enough for me to do what is being asked of me in the course and it is ridiculous that this is not how Coursera views the situation. My ability to do the work at my convivence was a major factor in me deciding to do the IBM Data Science certificate course. Obviously this is a false narrative. In hindsight, I wish I never signed up for this certificate program. It has felt like a giant commercial for IBM products and then I actually got to the point to where they were overtly trying to milk more money out of me.  ",0,2,Gregory Moore,101347838

This means you are at the mercy of other students who may have less experience than you and may notbe qualified in grading assignments. Also it may mean you have to wait a long time before you get your certificate. It would be better to implement a Kaggle-style assessment of the models and use that to obtain a score and turn that into a grade. This would be transparent and instantaneous.Some of the forum answers provided by the teaching staff are half baked and often inconsistent. e.g. they give example code for making a figure and and also a figure.

Maybe that content is covered in the courses before this one in the certification sequence.  I didn't see a prerequisite knowledge list for this course, but that would be helpful for future learners who are considering taking this course by itself.  The reason I'm giving this course 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the typos that occurred, especially in the directions of the final graded project.  I was able to read through the discussion threads about the final project to get a better understanding of what I was expected to do (because part of the directions don't make sense), but those posts are from over a year ago, meaning the typos haven't as of yet been corrected in the course.

learning and building my final_capstone_project.

It is fine that you can put stuff inside your python (yes, I said this), but you have to understand, why are you doing this. You have to be understand how does it work. These libraries is just to try something out fast. The real implementation of the sophisticated algorithms is much more complicated. That doesn’t mean you have to be a PhD to do it, but you have to understand basic math that is going behind the curtain. It’s enough even for one algorithm.

He explained most of the concepts especially using real life scenarios like customer segmentation, detection of cancer and many more. Using these real life examples in the explanation made me understand the course very well and also appreciate machine learning. It will be very easy with anyone with mathematical background though people that are not mathematical inclined may have some difficulties understanding some of the concepts. Nevertheless, going through the lab section will make you understand the concepts very well even if you didn't get all the theoretical concepts. The final project was also centered based on what was taught and easy to follow by anyone that paid apt attention to the lectures and followed duly in the lab exercises.

That last statement described my workflow during the final assignment/project of this course.Quite simply, this course was brilliant because not only did it bring everything we've learned so far together but it also built upon the last course and properly introduced us to Machine Learning and its applications. In his videos, Saeed successfully breaks down complex topics into digestible byte-sized content and ensures that you intuitively understand what is going on. One of the best pieces of advice I have received in regards to my learning and in life in general is to make sure you have a strong grasp of the fundamentals and these become building blocks to much more complex topics. That in a nutshell is what I believe this course has done for me.To those who are reading this review, trying to decide whether or not to take this course... just do it! What are you waiting for? No seriously? This might be one of the best decisions you make this year. If you've been racing through the other courses up to this point, I advise you to slow down once you get here and really try to digest what Saeed has taught here.Watch the videos, pause, take notes, rewind, continue watching, learn, code.

provided basic to intermediate knowledge of most of machine learning algorithms,
must to know for beginners. Few minutes introductory video on any given
