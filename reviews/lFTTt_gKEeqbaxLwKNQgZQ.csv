122127697~COURSE!~lFTTt_gKEeqbaxLwKNQgZQ,1677488860185,4,0,"Great introductory course. Perhaps it would be useful to include a few specific examples of wins in development achieved through civil society involvement, including advocacy - not always within the framework of international development cooperation and its standards. However, otherwise this is an excellent training that covers all main bases. The highlight is to my view the often brilliant interventions and practical wisdom by persons involved in the issue, including civil society leaders as well as experts in international development.",0,0,Josep Zapater,122127697
