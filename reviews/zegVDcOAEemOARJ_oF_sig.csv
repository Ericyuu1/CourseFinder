""15 minute"" videos actually take closer to 1 hour if you take notes, since each slide is full of information.

And finally I really liked the two live interviews with Doctors Alan Mann and Neil Vora.Regarding the final task of making a project on Mars, I find it a fascinating job. To do this, I would like to read the Kim Stanley Robinson trilogy on Mars so that I can better document myself and do a good job. It is a pity that there is not enough time for it!I am actually a teacher in a secondary school in the field of sanitation and health. I have a degree in Chemical Sciences and I also have a degree in Industrial Chemical Engineering. I don't think I will go back to studying a third degree at the University, basically due to lack of time, but it is a pity that a university with the prestige of Princeton does not prepare a simple paper where it says that students from all over the world have passed through its university, although be online. This is the only aspect that I did not like about the course: not having the possibility of obtaining a simple certificate, as I have already said, for me has been more a personal issue than a professional one. In any case, I recommend this course to any student, teacher or person who is interested in this topic, since history has taught us to know the future better and above all as a tribute to all those people who have left their lives for the good of humanity.",0,4,Monica Salinas,65690308
