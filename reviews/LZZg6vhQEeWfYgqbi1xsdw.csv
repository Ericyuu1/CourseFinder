5821351~COURSE!~LZZg6vhQEeWfYgqbi1xsdw,1509911066766,5,0,"Well Worth the Effort!Having just completed the HSK Prep Certification Course, I knew I needed to focus on recognizing and understanding basic Chinese Characters. Completing this course has required me to continue daily contact with the Mandarin language skills from the HSK course and improve (somewhat), the vital reading and (to some extent) writing skills necessary to fully develop facility with this language. I recommend this course of study specifically for those who've had an introduction to Mandarin, since the material here is (in my opinion) contextual and (of course) grounded in the grammatical structures of Mandarin, without a prior introduction this course material may appear abstract and self-referential. I found the course to be a reinforcement of the lessons learned and not-quite learned during my HSK Prep course. Thank you for the well structured opportunity to continue my growth. ",0,1,James K.

4852111~COURSE!~LZZg6vhQEeWfYgqbi1xsdw,1488308699653,5,0,"Learning about the characters was very useful for me.  It helped me to understand the connections between similar characters and also taught me a few new vocabulary words.  I also feel that I gained an understanding in the thinking of Chinese people and culture by learning about these characters.  Distinguishing between the strokes also helped me to recognize the differences between similar characters.  I love the lack of English used in this course as well.  One major con for this course is that the tests require that students have some intermediate understanding of Chinese grammar.  If this course is truly for beginners,  then either those grammar aspects should be explained in the course or the fill in the blank sentences should be altered in some way that allows students to answer with limited knowledge of grammar.  The good thing is that there's usually only one or two questions like that on each test. Also, some of the slides in the middle of the course also got messed up in some way where they skip over characters or repeat characters multiple times.  That was confusing,  but not impossible to understand.  It needs to be fixed though. Thanks to everyone who put this course together. I appreciate your hard work. 谢谢您们。",0,18,Kelly Pratt,4852111

The pace is quite sustained, so do not skip, as the lessons are carefully strung together so as to make the building blocks of the foundation of the written language more understandable, like a building code. 15-stroke words? Fine! I now can decipher their components AND I remember the vocabulary a lot better, because it is anchored as a visual marker as well. Good luck! Keep practicing!
