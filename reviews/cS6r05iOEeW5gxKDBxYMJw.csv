Some of the contents are more ""academical"" than ""practical"", making the course not particularly adapted for aspiring entrepreneurs.2. The assignments are poor and there is no interaction with the teachers whatsoever even if you have paid for obtaining a certification for the course.3. Despite the description, the course is almost entirely in French language with only English subtitles.4. There are several other courses about creating and developing startups that are better than this one, with more practical and direct application (and mostly for free!).",0,1,Maurizio Vaccari,20478787

701050~COURSE!~cS6r05iOEeW5gxKDBxYMJw,1477042824701,3,0,"Excellent content undermined by technical problems. The non-multiple-choice assignment (which involves analyzing a business plan) is particularly annoying. It requires uploading of screenshots but there is no ""upload"" feature is available. The assignment must be graded by ""peers"" -- which means, if you happen to take this course at a time when no one else is taking it, you're out of luck.Re: content, I would discourage you from taking this course if you don't speak fluent French. Indeed, you even need to understand how the French sometimes mis-translate into English, because some words in the answers to the multiple-choice quizzes don't exist in any English dictionary -- you will only understand them if you can guess what French term inspired the bad translation. The pace of lecture-hall-style discourse in the videos is such that subtitles will not save you if you don't understand French.These technical and minor content issues are unfortunate, because the core content i s really quite good.",0,1,Daniel de Segovia Gross,701050
