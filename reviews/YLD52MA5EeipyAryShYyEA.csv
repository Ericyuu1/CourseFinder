A paper from Fraunhofer itself discussed it in details, ""The digital twin theory"".The development process presented in the video is quite waterfall-like. Gone are the days for such software development. If not agile, people use iterative processes as minimum. I do not understand why digital twin development process should be different from other software & systems development approaches.The last video refers to Gartners Hype cycle for Emerging Technologies 2018. What about the 2019 version where the mention of digital twins is lost. And when it comes to 2020 version, it only talks about ""ditial twin of the person"". Is is because it was really a hype?The course talks about digital master, digital shadow and digital twin without giving reference to the appropriate research articles that suggest this terminology.
