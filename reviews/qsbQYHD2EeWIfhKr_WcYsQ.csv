A lot of the quizzes had errors in display, where instead of displaying options it gave the message ""Math not terminated in box"", hiding the actual content. The course felt very shallow and nothing was done in depth. I feel like many youtube videos do the job better than this. The worst part by far was the instructors voice. It was incredibly harsh and disturbing and off-setting. The audio quality was abysmal and there was no video narration. I found myself not wanting to complete the course only because of the way the professor spoke.

Perhaps I was just looking for too much.  Maybe Manchester will offer a sequel? If so I would enrol and check it out. I also found the course to be rather understaffed in that when I tried asking some questions on the forums it took weeks for even another student to reply, much less an instructor.  In addition there seem to have been several wrong answers on the quizzes, as well as typos such as 106 instead of 10^6.
