There is some feedback I would like to share with the creators of that course so that it remains relevant and updated:
1. Some links do not work (it does not give the best impression)
2. As fashion is defined by fast movement the videos shared in my opinion need to be updated and should not be of almost a decade ago
3. Apart from discussing the current trends of the luxury industry (like corporate responsibility), and some obvious future trends like the importance of e-tailing, I would love it if I had seen some more interesting and unique insights about the evolution of the luxury goods industry. There was nothing mentioned in the course I already didn't know.
4. Before starting the lesson I was a bit concerned that the weight on these (fashion and luxury) industries (although intertwined) would be disproportionate and this is the impression I was still left with when I finished the course. I feel like fashion was given more space than luxury. Thus my suggestion is to maybe separate these two subjects into two different courses so that people coming from different industries will choose the right course for them.

One more thing that bothers me its that the last test its based on a 200 pages reports that, if you are a beginner i'm not sure you are able to read nor understand,they could have done 2 more videos and explained better what they really wanted. so i dont feel this course deserves more than 3 stars, i expected way more from such Uni, both from english level and tests complexity (due to the english level still)",0,0,Simone Naddeo,78952547

Particularly this course provided many cases/interviews from Europe and Italy companies, which are very valuable for American and Asian audiences/students.  Con.:1.  Some links for reading materials are invalid. Please check them.2.  Some reading materials are a little old and need update. For example, some articles were written in 2015 or 2016. Fashion develops very fast. Especially, fashion has experienced some important changes during the pandemic period. So the course materalis needs to update in time. 3.   Given that the professors are not English native speakers, some video scripts are not well-presented. However, at least the course sliders can be reorganized in layout and needs a word-proof by an English native speaker so that they are better to read and understand.

Lo único que realmente no me gustó fue que se supone que es un curso para realizarlo en cualquier parte del mundo, y no es así lamentablemente. Porque para hacerlo bien, hay que conocer absolutamente todo de europa a nivel cultural. Yo conocía las marcas por mis viajes y por verlas en redes sociales, pero realmente en muchas preguntas se me dificultaba la respuesta, no porque no supiera el contenido sino porque era algo más cultural que de conocimiento de estudios del curso. Estaría bueno que no piensen unicamente en que todo el mundo que realiza el curso sepa absolutamente la historia de cada marca europea o de EEUU poniendola como ejemplos en los test. Más alla de eso, el curso es muy didáctico y enriquecedor. Lo recomendaría, pero solamente a las personas que tengan un conocimiento previo de marcas e historia europea. Gracias. DAIANA DEMAIO @daidemaio - English: I really liked the course! The only thing I really didn't like was that it is supposed to be a course to take anywhere in the world, and unfortunately it is not. Because to do it well, you have to know absolutely everything about Europe on a cultural level. I knew the brands from my trips and from seeing them on social networks, but in many questions it was really difficult for me to answer, not because I did not know the content but because it was something more cultural than knowledge of course studies. It would be good if they did not think only that everyone who takes the course absolutely knows the history of each European or US brand, putting it as examples in the tests. Beyond that, the course is very educational and enriching. I would recommend it, but only to people who have a prior knowledge of European brands and history. Thank you.

We’re talking complete corporate breakdowns of company structure, marketing, forecasting etc. You’re not gonna find these things just doing a Google search. As a 25 year veteran in the retail industry it’s rare to find some thing that’s so broadly covers such a vast array of topics that I didn’t previously fully understand or even knew existed. Don’t get me wrong they cover all the basics things that anyone in the industry or going into the industry should have a good grasp of but then there were interviews with some of my favorite designers and CEOs from my favorite brands. The only thing I found difficult was, I had to keep the captions turned on so that I can understand everything because I’m from Houston Texas and a lot of the annunciation given by the instructor didn’t fully translate audibly but I was able to comprehend what she was saying through reading the dialogue. Other than The language differences I had no trouble following along with everything being taught. Some classes you feel like they are intentionally trying to talk over your head or use Termanology that’s going to make you have to go look up all the words afterwards, but not in this class. I just can’t say enough good things about the instructor, she was brilliant and I am honored to have been able to learn from her impressive experience.

The tutors were clear in their communication in language. I had some difficulty with opening the pinterests links (they led to the pinterest homepage) and some of the articles were locked behing log-in walls.

Understanding  customer value propositions, different market segmentation and models, marketing strategies and communication of Luxury/Fashion Brands.Super comprehensive course took close to 40 hours to finish everything. Learnt a hell lot. Quiz 3 was really good. My friend who is in Brand Management was totally impressed with the amount of knowledge I gained from this course. In the beginning, I found the accent of the teachers very annoying but in the later parts, I found the accent quite sexy, especially Erika's :P But the bottom line is the teachers are fantastic.
