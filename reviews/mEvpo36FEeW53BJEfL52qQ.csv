946138~COURSE!~mEvpo36FEeW53BJEfL52qQ,1621208992419,3,0,"PROS:  Good at explaining the fundamentals of SDN.  The interviews helped separate the hype from the practical aspects of implementing SDN and making it clear that there is a lot that still needs to be developed.CONS:  1) The material is dated.  The lectures were created six years ago or more.  Six years is an eternity for fast moving technology. Several of the projects that were discussed in the lectures are no longer active.  The course badly needs to be updated. For example, one of the hottest applications of SDN today is with 5G, which isn't even mentioned in the course.  2) The course is very choppy.  Many of the links included in the module syllabus are broken or stale.  Also, the course appears to have had assignments and maybe lectures removed.  There are actually questions in some of the quizzes that refer to material that is no longer covered in lectures, or to assignments that are no longer included in the course!This is a worthwhile course, but it really needs to be rebuilt from the ground up.",0,0,David McBride,946138

52266783~COURSE!~mEvpo36FEeW53BJEfL52qQ,1630679870945,4,0,"Its a good course and not trying to be too spoonfed here, but I think some sort of help should be given for the assignments. 1. Assignments should be listed in the course itself instead of us trying to find it from the virtual drive, even then its not reader friendly. Why not just put a .pdf file? It seems trivial but it makes it easier to learn the material, it is afterall and online class with no support. 2. Why not put a step by step guide with a few questions for students to find out the answer in the assignment? Yes its spoonfeeding but because its online and its a relatively new topic, it can be helpful to have better resources, even if its assignment help. Yes, i know there are some geniuses can figure out on their own.Ultimately, Professor Nick needs to ask himself, if he provides this course for students to learn something, then the programming assignments should be heavily assisted through giving out the answers, because answers and spoonfeeding help people learn too, honestly, especially  for not so intelligent students. But anyway, I do like the depth, the interviews and the materials presented in this course, which to me, in 2021 is still kind of scarce. Thank you Prof Nick for your hard work preparing this course! I really appreciate it!",0,0,Sarah Hani,52266783
