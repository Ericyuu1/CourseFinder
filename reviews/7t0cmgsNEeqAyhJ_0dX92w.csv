44046814~COURSE!~7t0cmgsNEeqAyhJ_0dX92w,1658237509517,3,0,"I learned a lot of things in those 4 weeks. More specifically, I formulated a way of thinking about building code for formatting data by using not so common tidyverse verbs.  Drawbacks:  Each week's project is not helpful as you can't follow along the useless complex details about healthcare/gunfire ins USA, that distract you from the essence of the lesson which is to learn tidyverse. In addition, there are a year or more,questions in the forum that no one bothered to answered them.. so if you stuck somewhere throughout the course, you are on your own!

69322583~COURSE!~7t0cmgsNEeqAyhJ_0dX92w,1608048774667,3,0,"Course provides a good albeit very cursory overview of data wrangling tools in the tidyverse. However, the bulk of my time was wasted on a quiz question which was unclear/had wrong wording. As the figure is supposed to be keyed in (not multiple-choice), it was frustrating trying to guess what the question actually wanted.",0,4,Glenn,69322583
13622312~COURSE!~7t0cmgsNEeqAyhJ_0dX92w,1673645076641,5,0,"This course strikes a good balance between didactic material and the work required to do the Quizzes.  While the course material is the same as what you can find in the authors' book, the need to do the Quizzes in order to get credit makes the difference in actually learning the material.  It did take me 4 hours (not 1 hour) to do the Final Quiz/Project.",0,0,Evan Lee,13622312
