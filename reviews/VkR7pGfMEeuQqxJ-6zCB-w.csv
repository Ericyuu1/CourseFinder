113327816~COURSE!~VkR7pGfMEeuQqxJ-6zCB-w,1676197932198,3,0,"This course is less successful than the first two in the specialization. The presenters stumble a bit, there is a goo deal of repetition, and the content, most importantly, is often simply lists of things. I don't need to know which menus to use to set up my YouTube account; I can learn this on YouTube. Also importantly, there are long lists of features on the platforms with no good examples; it would really serve the course to have more specific examples, of, for example, what a Twitter card looks like and how it can be used creatively, rather than just listing it in a list of options. So, this is a functional course to get basic information, but not one that really prepares you to go out there and work in this sector. Even for a beginner course, I think DMI could do better.",0,0,Adam S.,113327816

In addition I found peer grading to be an absurd exercize and I felt very uncomfortable giving and receiving grades as neither I nor my peers have experience with this material.",0,0,Jan Burke,88077513
