There were not many assignments or practice questions provided and those that were there were all peer graded assignments with no oversight. On the one side the peer graded assignments are great because you can learn from the different ways others tackled the project, on the other hand your peers have a lot of control over your grade. Additionally, I was unable to see the comments and the way that my assignments were marked, so I have no idea what I should have done differently or better. I felt the course left the learner with a lot of responsibility to figure things out on their own and from the perspective of someone who decided to pay for a course to be guided through the subject, it seems like there should be more assignments and examples given from the professor and a professional marking your assignments who can tell you what to do better.

That being said, I was excited when this course info mentioned, and I quote, ""No prior knowledge of coding is needed for this course. We'll start at the beginning.""Imagine my unpleasant surprise when 15 minutes or so in, I get this in my lesson:Play video starting at 19 seconds and follow transcript0:19 we're in my directory. My prompt for my computer is Iras-Air: and the local directory that I'm running in is called CPrograms/W1. So here's where I develop some of the code that was being used in Week 1 of this class. So let's look at that directory, the way we can see that directory again where in terminal, for a Mackintosh terminal window, which is basically running Unix. So I can use Unix commands, the Unix command LS shows me the files in that directory. So we see there's an a.out file, there's something called add2.exe and then there are these.C files which are source files which are code and there we can see something like miles.exe, circle.exe, add2.exe. So all of that are what I previously compiled as N2 and executable and I can of course execute them. Let's look at add2.exe. So in order to execute them, all I have to do is say add2.exe, it says input two floats. Play video starting at 1 minute 58 seconds and follow transcript1:58 I do that and I'm done, 4.3 and 6.8 is 11.1. Now, if I want to develop a program, let's say I want to change the input to floats program to an input three floats. Let me try doing that. So I'm going to have add3. I'm going to call it add3.c., vi add3.c. So this command means create a file called add3.c. Play video starting at 2 minutes 44 seconds and follow transcript2:44 Now, it's going to look very much like add2.c. So basically and frequently the cases, I'm going to want to modify a pre-existing file. So I'll just read that file in and these are all VI commands. Again, in this class, I'm not going to go through all of the VI commands or Notepad commands, you're just going to have to get comfortable with using an editor. Netter is a critical tool for almost anything on a computer. Once you understand a little of it, you can get a tutorial that explains in detail the editing commands you need.I don't understand what is going on, and I do not understand why I need to get another tutorial to explain. Yes, I lack the basic facility of coding, that is obvious. But, do not market your course as one that is beginner friendly when it isn't!",0,25,Cold Okra,61748433

It is a very pour course, as it is very confusing what level the student should be. The lecturer just goes through some slides and just explains what happens in every line of a program, without giving any context to the actual C programming language. His explanations are most of the time confusing and do not really add any useful information. Some explanations he gives are really cryptic (""Passing the address of an int &int"" without giving any explanation on what this really means. The course is set as Beginner level). His tone and flow of speaking is really poor for a lecture (I had to make the video at x1.5 rate and it was feeling that he was speaking normally at that rate. Imagine how slow he speaks). Finally, the slides and presentations are one of the worst i came across into a lecture. He has hand written slides, which shows a C program. His hand writting is really messy, resembling that of a doctor. I doubt anyone can really decipher the programs he is showing. The least i would expect from a course, is for the slides to be informative, neat and well written, rather than a bunch of hand written programs put into a screen.

Instead of this course, I recommend potential students look at other C programming courses. Teaching Style: The course is taught in an old style, where there are  many lectures covering theory without practical examples. The newer and better teaching style is to teach a bit of theory, practice writing code with some practical exercises, then present more theory, then more practice writing more code. In this course one of the weeks in this course is only lectures. For that week it would have been nice to get some breaks between the lectures to practice writing code using the concepts that were just presented.The concept of presenting lecture material hand written on a white board is terrible. It is difficult to read the scribbling and cursive writing. The lecture material could be much better presented if it was printed in a Word document or on a Powerpoint slide, or in a graphical computer tool.The whole course is poorly assembled. There appear to be missing lectures. One of the lectures refers to another lecture that does not exist in the course. The assignments are poorly defined. To complete the assignments outside research is required to learn about functions and concepts that are not taught in the course. In two of the quizes,  answers are incorrect. The final exam has questions that have nothing to do with writing C code.An example of a much better Coursera course for teaching style is ""Python For Everyone"". I can highly recommend that course.

There is no link to the book, no pdf of the book available and the book is ~$70 to purchase new. I was able to find a used one online for about $10 luckily but was still of little help. In addition this course does not cover any of the fundamentals of programming, it just goes straight into programming in C.In addition, the discussion forum is of little value or use. On this platform there is peer reviews for your work and the discussion board is filled with people trying to circumvent the review process by getting others to review their code before submitting for review, it defeats the purpose and inundates the discussion board. When you do post up a real question there is virtual silence, no instructor, no one to help you so you feel totally left out and on your own.

In my very honest opinion, this course is suited for people with some background in programming because a lot of the concepts like function calls, params, etc. are not given any detail and are simply said in passing.Furthermore, Dr. Pohl's usage of Vim may be tolerable to some students but an IDE/text editor with highlighting would've been more visually appealing and would've aided in making the students keep up with the code.

To start with the positive sides, the teacher is clearly professional with thorough understanding of the topics he is lecturing. No ""monkey show, monkey do"" style, that can be found in many other places around the Internet.  Unfortunately, this course is messy. Some videos ""continue"" on topics that are covered in future videos. The exercises are often foolishly easy. The graded exercises, which I consider adequate level, lack precise instructions. This sloppiness makes me decrease the rating by one star.The other problem is, that trivial things seem to consume a lot of lecture time, while as the challenging topics that in a way distinguish C from modern high level programming languages  - E.g. pointers, arrays, arrays of pointers, passing arguments to functions, allocating memory, freeing memory - are being mentioned somewhere in between the lines without enough explanation, examples and practice problems.

I also noted that many students (50%+) copy wrong solutions of each other even without the effort to try to compile them (I reviewed of one of the exercises more then 9 times).

10067924~COURSE!~yzaI66h4EeeDkArsR_C2QA,1585590746874,5,0,"I successfully completed the first three weeks of this course. I have completed four other beginning Python programming courses on Coursera. Like those, this was a great course. I have, however, decided to withdraw from the course.Like other programming courses I have taken, the learning curve for this one gets steep at the halfway point in the course. Looking over the remaining material, I decided I would not be able to complete the rest of the course in the allotted time. There are also no assessments or practice exercises in the fourth week, so it's hard to gauge how you are doing.Despite the difficulty of the subject manner, I really enjoyed the course. The professor has written a book with Al Kelley, _A Book on C_, that is helpful for the course. The lectures themselves are clear and informative.I am a UCSC graduate but have been away from school for 30 years. I would recommend this course to someone currently studying computer science at college or perhaps a recent graduate who wishes to learn C programming. Overall, I think this is definitely a programming course worth taking. Like many courses, there is a significant time commitment. I still found the course difficult even though I had plenty of time to spend on it.I haven't given up on learning the basics of C. I plan on trying another course on this or another learning platform.  ",0,9,Deleted Account,10067924
