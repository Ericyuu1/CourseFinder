1594659~COURSE!~ZCk7nKCiEeiMLxLa-jTn0A,1591801100666,4,0,"Overall one was given more variations on the SIR Model. While several models were talked about, I would have liked more info on the stochastic site. This course should be split up in two to go deeper into the modelling and maybe some other approaches than in R. Rating a paper in the end is good to give you basically the tools to model, but it should be also a bit deeper. But to get a quick overlook, it is definitely worthwhile. ",0,0,Nils Koesters,1594659

60790638~COURSE!~ZCk7nKCiEeiMLxLa-jTn0A,1600594127306,5,0,"The importance of the SIR model is needs of an hour, due to COVID-19,  HIV, Dengue, Hay-fewer and many more infectious diseases, in analysis and building of the Compartment model in which S-I-R; it  stands for the Symptomatic-Infected-Recovered,  When we need to build this model for our own country, we need to observed the PEAK prevalence (i.e. maximum number of symptomatic people during the epidemic), need to be considered, studied and analyzed. This course found to be helpful in order develop and build combination of paper-based and computer-based modelling, with the parameters their estimated values like R0 which is basic reproduction number, and so on.....thanks",0,0,DHARMENDRA CHANDRAPRAKASH KOTHARI,60790638

The quality of the peer grading assignments was impressive (both in terms of getting tested and the quality of the work I got to review). Thoroughly recommend this course (and the entire specialization, really) to anyone with interest in infectious disease epidemiology in general. Kudos to the Imperial College team for this excellent set of courses.",0,0,Mohd. Adeebul Haque,5004071

All three courses in the specialization are really thoughtful for learners to progress further. Thanks to all mentors, discussion prompts, and co-learners on the discussion forum for the support. Special thanks to Imeprial College of London - Dr. Nim, Dr, Halder, Dr. Bowman and Ms. Nora Schmit for coming up with such a good course on Coursera platform. ",0,0,Rajendra Aparajit,14576739
