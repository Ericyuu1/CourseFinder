The value of this course is as a introduction to a political discourse, not as a good description of the subject it tries to explain, for this is one sided and does not give the counter arguments nearly any time. The terms 'magic' and 'we believe' are used, this does not belong in academia. ",0,0,Ole Tobias Bøgh,22926052
