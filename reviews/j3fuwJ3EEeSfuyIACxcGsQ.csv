They are so lucid that I feel I understand the material better now. The course is well structured; as I go through it systematically, I can see how one lesson connects to the concepts presented in a previous one.Thank you so much, Dr. Tsividis for sharing your enthusiasm and knowledge about this topic.",0,2,Debashree Ghosh,14776840
