Coming from a science background, I am continually disappointed at how much MEANINGLESS HOT-AIR BULLSHIT JARGON AND HAND-WAVING -- I call it ""the Five-Axis MHABHJ Paradigm, which is based on 7 factors formed by 3 circles of focus"" -- there is in business and how long it always takes you people to get to the point, on the very rare occasion that there is one. This entire course -- if you can call it that -- on Managing Social and Human Capital could be summarized in about 2 pages. Ten minutes to say: “organizations must adapt to change, have a clear plan, communicate it and execute it”. Wow! The professor is monotonous, boring and drags on forever instead of being concise and direct. Moreover, many of the slides had typos on them (""shot-term"", ""time"" instead of ""timely"", etc.). Lastly, don't use terms like ""Chuck"" (referring to Charles Schwab), when you know that there are students from around the world taking this class. Perhaps Coursera / Wharton could offer problem-solving exercises that make students think and work, instead of just giving us fake wrote-memory quizzes that people could pass without even watching the videos (Google).
