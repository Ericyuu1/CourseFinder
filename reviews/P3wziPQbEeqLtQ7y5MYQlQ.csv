84254475~COURSE!~P3wziPQbEeqLtQ7y5MYQlQ,1676484646724,5,0,"I found the course quite helpful. I started by learning skills to make the most out of online learning like Kolbe's approach, key elements of good notes, and different reading and note-taking strategies whether you are reading for information, for understanding or critical in-depth reading as well as the management of study time and reflective learning. I learnt how to collaborate effectively with my teammates in an online setting through a fantastic exercise, good netiquette, tips for effective online communication and various tools for online collaboration like Doodle, Padlet, Shared documents, Google forms etc.I really admire the addition of the part of critical thinking as it is much needed to know how to analyze and evaluate any piece of information and to develop your own opinion.  It was a great effort but it would be highly appreciated if you add an exercise for practising critical analysis of information just as the ones in the 1st 2 weeks of the course. I would rate this course 9.5/10. A great effort indeed. Thank you",0,0,Farwa Iman,84254475

and points. I would have loved a video but nonetheless, it does not hinder my understating.
I have done a course in conflict management but the tool that this course used
to show the scenario of teamwork and potential issues was better in terms of
giving an example, rather a practical example of the situation. Some people
like me learn a lot when we are hands on into the topics. As such the tools
used were very good. Highly recommend this course to anyone looking to equip
themselves with basic but important skills to learn online (and offline too
such as using critical thinking and using search engines)",0,0,Emmanuel Hasan Syed,68453195
