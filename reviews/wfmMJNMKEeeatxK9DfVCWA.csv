I wish he would have discussed how to learn things from scratch and how to do more complex debugging, with an emphasis on knowing how to navigate to the Microsoft Library and learn based on the documentation.You might otherwise have difficulty at course end working on items not covered. Specifically, it would have been helpful to actually navigate to the VBA Library to explore error codes (which I had constantly but he never did), to learn how to understand the possible arguments for given statements.Finally, AND I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH, I needed waaay more time navigating to the library and learning to figure out which objects / properties / methods do and do not work together. Often times, I would be trying to write a code, and I have an idea of what I need to do, but I try to pair the wrong object and property.This course (and the preceding course) did a middling job explaining the object model and reference in such a way that the student could go out and explore a new function / statement / object with confidence.

This Specialisation was incredibly useful to me as a novice programmer.  Unlike some of the other free/low cost online content out there on VBA this course is well-structured and rigorous enough to actually gain a solid foundation in programming concepts, and more importantly to be able to apply the material to real world situations.  I've only just completed the course but have already created a couple of macro-based report collation tools at work that have been very well received since they save time and improve accuracy.  I have a couple of other bigger projects I'm now planning at work, which have long been an ambition of mine but out of my league until now. The course really is quite challenging (if you have experience in another program it will probably come much easier for you!) and one really does have to think and try things out in the assignments and later projects to get an outcome - which is important since that's what it'll be like writing VBA in the wild!  The video content is very well presented and well-thought out and Charlie's passion for maths, programming and creative solutions really shone through.  The content is structured logically, with a good progression in difficulty moving along the weeks and parts.Another great thing about this course is that rather than get bogged down in the minutiae of every VBA term/syntax it focuses on broad programming concepts such as loops, iteration, arrays and debugging/problem solving. So I'm now feeling much more confident to get into learning other languages I have in my future learning goals",0,0,Jessica Haxen,65619285

I was prepared to do some boring stuff with numbers (that was my initial impression of what Excel is), but it turned out to be so much fun! I'd like to thank Charlie Nuttleman for making this course. Being a teacher myself, I can fully appreciate the hard work that is behind the concise and clear videos and challenging quizzes and assignments. I think that assigments are the best thing about the course: it is while doing them that you realize that you didn't actually understand something in the screencasts, so you have to actually return and rewatch and finally understand it completely. I've improved my skills significantly and loved every minute of the course. I strongly recommend doing this course if you are interested in Excel VBA. ",0,0,Kate Yakovleva,71924445
3373334~COURSE!~wfmMJNMKEeeatxK9DfVCWA,1616303457450,5,0,The screencasts are very helpful and understandable. Mr. Nuttelman does an excellent job in engaging with the learner and explaining different topics in a simple manner. The quizzes and assignments allow the learner to apply and practice the lessons to ensure understanding and mastery of the lessons.

I know I'm pedantic and orderly, but I've learnt the style comes a long way later one, especially when others are left with your code, having to debunk it.By style, I mean indenting the code, using fully qualified variables and ranges and spending that extra ten seconds to add stuff such as Prompt:=, Buttons:=, Title:=, etc. No, don't use the integers returned by the user's answer to a vba.MsgBox; use the Buttons instead.What is easier to understand:if Ans = 6 then...orif Ans = vbYes then...The others coming after you will thank you for making it easier for them.Similarly, adding a prefix before a variable (such as ""sAns"", where ""s"" indicates that it's dimensioned as a variable) will also make lives easier. More importantly, adding a prefix to Form components is a must, I'd say. What is easier to understand? ""Names"" or ""cboNames"" for a combo box?Ok, enough being critical!

Second thing is that Charlie was able to find the sweet spot in terms of the difficulty of the assignments. Those challenges are great. That grind is worth it. Today only I shall be starting with the part 3 of the course. Before parting, I would like to give some advice to the learners. If it is possible, try to make notes because it is easy to revise later and also if you need some information for the assignment, you don't have to go back to assignment to find that. Just refer to notes and move on.  If you cannot make physical notes, you can download an app called Greenshot. It directly saves to the output file, wherever you want.
