It's poorly planned and poorly executed. They either don't have a curriculum and instruction specialist helping them create their content, or they need to retrain the current one with active PIP in place for accountability. Regularly, concepts are introduced out of order, or activities that build on one another are sequenced incorrectly. For example, there's a CSS activity that requires you to have made a certain website first in HTML. But, you're never directed to make that website. BUT WAIT, four or five activities later, you're directed to make the HTML website that you used in the previous CSS activity. What's worse is that the CSS activity introduces you to a handful of concepts, and then asks you to develop CSS using concepts that were introduced NO WHERE ELSE IN THE COURSE, not even in the cheatsheet. I don't know who oversees learning and instruction, but they apparently have no background in education, instructional methods, or pedagogy.
