48806006~COURSE!~JJ1g_B6sEeWFIxLDnS6_kQ,1588402759621,4,0,Great course. I joined this course to learn about meat science and technology. I learned very much from this course. One thing that I want to learn from this course that is not probably present in the course is the modern technological methods and types of equipment used to check the quality of meat in the meat industry. I suggest that this course should be updated or a more advanced course in meat science and technology will be available for keen learners.  Thank you,0,0,Hafiz Syed Muhammad Ammar,48806006

41715151~COURSE!~JJ1g_B6sEeWFIxLDnS6_kQ,1561472063877,5,0,"I entered this course being very skeptical, I was expecting propaganda like material. But I was pleasantly surprised with all the information I learned, and the host being clear about the information. Some information is left out like where only a video is shown of electrical stunning but not CO2 stunning (which would show an animal chocking for 15-30 seconds, depending on the breed) or halal slaughtering. I have yet to learn details about the exact feed given to pigs (the host hinted at one point that there is a chance pigs can transfer diseases by eating rats). I also would have liked to see more emphasis on the living conditions of these animals where they spend most of their life.This lecture has not changed my mind, but it has taught me a lot, which is most valuable.I recommend this course as there is so much I did not know about this industry, even though I considered myself knowledgeable prior.-------------Update:Go watch the videos of week 6 and tell me how this is not blatant false meat-industry propaganda.I do not recommend this course anymore, and I do not think Coursera should be allowed to host such false information that is harmful to the public.
