It also touched on some minute details about the search for extra-terrestrial life. However, it seems to me that the bigger picture in this course is missing. I feel that the topics for extraterrestrial life should have been explained and expounded some more.  Many of us know that we are not alone in the universe. And there have been both documented and undocumented evidences and claims of encounters with otherwordly intelligences like physical humanoid beings and their ships. Certain protocols like remote viewing and the so called 'close encounters of the fifth kind (CE-5)' are also being utilized by many and are getting favorable results. For me this course could do better. To get a certificate like this is quite rare. I hope the content of this course, especially on extraterrestrial evidence and life would be expanded and be discussed more openly in the future",0,0,Kevin Echaluse,55320459

If you haven't already taken GCSE Science then much of this will go too fast and will require considerable extra work in learning the basics (there's a reason it takes months in schools).  The course is completely outdated, having not been updated in twelve years.  This is UNACCEPTABLE in a field of science that makes near-weekly advances.  There are mistakes in many of the quizzes, either in the questions themselves or more frequently in the answers (again, many of which are outdated or worse, updated but not matching the course materials as presented).  And there are 'joke' questions which I find insulting - asking if 'Barry Manilow' appears on the Voyager disks for exmple.  Either this is a serious course, worth taking and (in my case) spending money on, or it is a joke course that is not worth the effort.

So, many thanks to the expert, Professor Charles Cockell. Even though this course is a bit outdated, it is still a wonderful and valuable presentation and yet an excellent way of informing the public about the search for Extraterrestrial Life as well.  I too live in hope that with the help and knowledge of some real supra intelligence here, perhaps we too could find a workable solution to some of the worst problems and one that has the ability to stop this murderous, earth entity from destroying the only real source of nature that we All came to live by.

Ironically, the course made me reflect on how humans imagine and construct the boundaries around themselves and life more generally. Viruses are a good example. Professor Cockell did a *stellar* job (excuse the obvious pun). As I listened to his lectures, I made numerous connections to my work in social anthropology. The format is perfect. I was allowed to work at my own pace. The quizzes were not difficult, but required effort. One really needs to pay attention to the lectures, and I suggest making copious notes (I have some 60 pages for this course). I would make only two suggestions: a) update some of the material, as it became obvious a couple of times that it was created a while ago; b) include the histories of space thinking/exploration beyond Euro-American contexts (e.g. Abbasid Golden Age, Muslim Spain, Mughals and various Indian subcontinental polities, China).

The course is delivered by an excellent team and offers valuable insight into the cutting-edge field.I would just like to mention to anyone thinking of taking this course that while it is indeed catered to beginners, there are some sections in which it would be helpful to have a basic understanding of cell biology (ultrastructure in particular) as technical terminology is used and could potentially be overwhelming without some prior knowledge.However this only applies to a small part of the course and the rest is very much accessible. Highly recommended.",0,1,Riya,14069941
