110456342~COURSE!~lO5va7h_EeayqhK4SOTn7g,1674189655379,1,0,great course but unavailability of their online tools makes the course almost impossible to complete !  they call it a beginner's course but there are many parameters in the tools that you need to set on your own and there is no instruction given in the sample files !

Could emulate Zoom playbacks where lecturers share fullscreens and have their talking heads on the right hand corner.- For the tutorial final quiz video, it will be more challenging and more likened to real life if the lecturer doesn't tell us what tools to use and their functions (I guess this is why it is a beginner's course haha).(- Less important but Shinny's accent is sometimes hard to decipher and the transcript translates wrongly but I do not blame her since she is not a native English speaker. Suggestion: find someone to fix the transcript for people who rely on visual learning (i.e. reading transcripts)?)--------------------------------------------All in all, it definitely took some time for me to digest the applications and procedures for each tool.

I have some interest in Bioinformatics. It is not possible for me to grab all the aspect in that subject. So, I am grabbing it in scattered way. The course I have completed in ""DTU"" has captured a complete different aspect which I haven't seen before. The most important things is that it is a very neat and clean course with a specific direction. All the labs which I have performed here has been well taught in various videos. Though it is not possible for me to understand every parts of all the videos  but still it gives me enough knowledge to complete the practicals. I hope it will help me in future run.I would like to specify just one problem related with the course. Every course in Coursera has ""Discussion Forum"" corresponding to every week, which I have found missing, as it solves lot of dynamic problem in each week's tutorial. I am sorry if ""Discussion Forum"" is already there  and I have ignored that.Thanks You very much,Gourab Das",0,1,Gourab Das,21578418
