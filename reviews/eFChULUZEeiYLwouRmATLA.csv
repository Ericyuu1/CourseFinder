Cause we still have a high level of domestic violence and at work and during studying women face harassment all the time. Recently my two colleagues (both journalists) talked about the 8th of March and a demonstration of women in Kyiv, the capital, the slogan of it was ""The pandemic has a woman's face"". Because cases of violence against women in Ukraine really became a separate epidemic during the lockdown, but women began to tell about it publicly more and more. So, my colleagues (women) at the beginning of the podcast said that they cannot remember some violence or hostility against themselves. But at the end they began to remember, yes, there were several cases of hostile behaviour from men's side in their life: at a university, at school, at work, in the street... So. Women just often think its normal, I mean, that this is like a part of life that they cannot avoid and even their memory doesn't save those cases as violent ones. Awful. Must be changed!

The first week of the course was really an introduction, that explained what feminism is and what components it has. The second week was about a workers strike in the 1950s, and in addition to misogyny, addressed classism and racism and the intersectionality of all of it. Week 3 was about the Angela Davis case in the 1970s, and I found it really fascinating. The fourth week was much more modern and dealt with the #MeToo movement and how that has changed the way we look at sexual violence against women. The instructor was very impressive, and it was cool that she was involved in a lot of these cases/movements, because it helped me understand what it was like firsthand. The course is also not very taxing, as I'm in school right now taking a lot of honors classes, but through extra time during the week and on the weekends I was easily able to finish it early. I found this course very interesting and educational, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a deeper look on feminism.",0,0,Emma Blodgett (Student),74756332

I learnt so much from this course. I am sad to say I had not heard of any of the women mentioned in this course before, i.e Anita Hill, Angela Davis, anything about the Salt of the Earth strike... this is very disappointing and perhaps shows that education, too, needs to change in order to make people aware of women fighting oppression. I identified as a feminist before this course, but only recently. I feel that even the word 'feminist' has become 'dirty' in society- men make jokes about feminists all the time and have successfuly made many people feel ashamed to be apart of the movemet, i.e the stereotype that all feminists are crazy and dramatic (funnily enough, as Professor Aptheker mentioned, these are words commonly associated with women...especially when passionate or angry about something). I think it is disgusting that many girls will grow up thinking the same, forced to believe that such a beautiful movement is crazy. It is not. It is sane, and warranted, especially now with #MeToo.
