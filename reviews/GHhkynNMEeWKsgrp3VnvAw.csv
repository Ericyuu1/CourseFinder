12336260~COURSE!~GHhkynNMEeWKsgrp3VnvAw,1522080998980,3,0,I really enjoyed the course. There were really interesting concepts to learn about and it also forced you to reflect more seriously on which city you should choose for yourself. Professor Florida is also really good at explaining and presenting. Where there is space for improvement. The readings could be more comprehensive. Some were articles that really didn't offer that much. And secondly I think the course could really go deeper into the topics presented. I felt that it was more of an general overview. Still a valuable course to do if you are thinking about cities. It is worth the time.,0,0,Giannis Raptis,12336260
5974060~COURSE!~GHhkynNMEeWKsgrp3VnvAw,1519300230841,3,0,"The topic is interesting, though slightly misleading - the answer about your search about the place in city is not very clear. A lot of factual information - the course is very thourough. The tone is rather pessimistic and almost all readings are by the same author. Minor technical issue - I listened to the course in headphones and the sound was not very loud. All in all - a lot of interesting info, issues and problems about big megacities, no more, no less.",0,0,yaroslav,5974060

I really enjoyed the reading materials as well as the lectures, however; not all of the links were available (i.e.: articles in the Atlantic and the Globe and Mail had been archived) and some of the resources required subscriptions or purchases, but over all, very interesting topics and research.  I very much liked applying the tools and resources to what I valued to determine the best place for me to live, or to critically start thinking about the politicans and their visions/influences on shaping the cities and how that aligns with my values and not only the kind of place that I want to live in, but how they can influence/contribute to my country's economy and the creative and diverse people that we want to attract to further grow our cities and country.

It encourages further research, reading Richard Florida, Ed Glaeser and Jane Jacobs books, but also, as it is my case, search furthe references about the economics of cities, or urban economics. I'm sure the instructor vision can be challenged, but he has a point that deserves a careful attention. Is the creative class real? can you define as a class such mixture of workers (artists, doctores, engineers, ...)?,  what is the nature of the new urban crisis the instructor defines?, what can we do to remedy it?, all those are very interesting questions.The final thought, and the final assigment, constitute challenging work of auto analysis. Why I'm living in the city I live, what other cities I would like to move if I had the oppotunity, why, which are the pros and cons. And, if your work and your mate are your most important decisions in your live, why your city is secondary (I live where the work is, or where my spouse lives) when it absolutelly determines the other two. It's time to think about where I want to live, and why.",0,0,Jose F. Riera,3191988

The course also discusses the problems that today's cities are facing. The coursework invites participants to really get to know their own cities, be analytical of their strong and weak points and finally challenges students into an exercise of choosing the best cities for them.The course examples seem slightly biased towards North American cities, so this would be a point to be addressed in future iterations. Finally, would be interesting to adapt the Place Finder tool for different demographics, since several steps within are only suitable for adult professionals.",0,1,Mihnea Tufis,157233
