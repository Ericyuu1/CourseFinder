Professor Keith Devlin introduced us to why high school mathematics is different from university mathematics. High school mathematics deals with math which invented kind of before the 18th century. But what happens to the mathematics that was invented in the 19th century. Because of your kind information many modern mathematics techniques invented in the 19th century. How to deal with those problems?In varsity level mathematics you just don’t use or apply formula that was predetermined but you think about the problem. You brainstorm and make the reasoning behind the problem. A mathematical proof needs to be dealt with great care. Because you have to deal with its uniqueness universality. Of course, you have some certain predefined tools that you learned in high school, but you need to think before applying, not as it was done as a template set in high school.So, Coursera offers this course to introduce you to a glimpse of how mathematical thinking procedure works. This course introduces us to Logic and Logic Combinators, Logic Implication, and Equivalence, Quantifiers, several proof techniques such as proof by contradiction and proof by Induction, proofs involving Quantifiers, introductory Number Theory, and some proves associated with it. The hardest part of this course is Real Analysis. Each proof associated with Real Analysis involves so much thinking and reasoning.

The content was spread evenly, it includes everything that is required for a student to read and understand mathematical theorems. Concepts such as implications, equivalence, quantifiers are clearly and concisely explained, I am sure even for people who are learning university mathematics for the first time, the lectures are very easy to understand. That being said though, as in any university math courses, solely listening and taking notes in the lecture could not make you a decent grade. The most important material provided by this course is the assignment, which is provided at the ‘download’ tab at the bottom of the video. The assignment deliberately included confusing examples and counterintuitive facts to trick people who have misunderstandings in their concepts, and detailed explanations for harder questions were provided as well. I love how professor Devlin reason as well: he proceeds very carefully, writing down what he speaks in every argument, and then translate it to symbols in mathematics.  I found that technique very efficient as I tackle the assignment problem. If you want to get out most from the course, remember to complete all the assignment and check your answer by asking your friends / in the forum! The test flight peer-assessment is also a very enjoyable experience, looking at other MOOC-mates attempting to prove the same questions enables me to learn more on how to improve presentation style when writing as a mathematician. Overall, this is a very interesting course for people who loves mathematics, it serves as a transition from high school mathematics to university mathematics as well. Highly recommended to people who wants to know more about what university mathematics looks like!",0,9,Ching Kiu Ryan Lam,48066184

One more comment on the final peer review assignment: the question about whether 0 is a natural number.Only after taking this course and doing some research on the Internet do I realise that there's a lot of argument on this question. I am a college student from China, and I major in physics, rather than mathematics. For me, the statement ""0 is the least natural number"" is a fact that was written in my primary school's textbook. So I was quite surprised when I was told that 0 is not a natural number. After searching on the Internet, I finally got more knowledge on this. Fortunately I was not supposed to lose too much on that. However, I do recommend that you make this clear in the course content so that everyone can discuss under a common assumption, regardless of their background education.Above all, this course experience is a lot of fun. There's no standard answers here, only remarkable thinking and a space of infinity to explore. Thank you for all of it! I'm giving 23 out of 24 marks for this course, taking away 1 point for clarity about whether 0 is a natural number.",0,0,徐致远,13028170
6922756~COURSE!~OEZ3_J-PEeWaZBIXh-2nQw,1581259812723,5,0,"Professor Keith Devlin wrote and participated in this course for some years. He has stepped away from it since (he explains why in a post on  https://mooctalk.org/ ) but the course remains a valid educational experience. I return to it every so often, mainly to have a go at answering other learners' questions on the discussion forums - which is a learning experience in itself- and try out different approaches to proof-writing. I can do this because the course has a peer-review element at the end, where your work will be read and reviewed by other students. If a given approach is faulty, difficult to follow or contains a mistake that you have over-looked, one of your fellow students will pick up on it. This might sound daunting but, ultimately, it is a much better deal than just satisfying yourself. A third aspect of this course which is challenging is that you are also assigned the task of reviewing other people's work, which is a surprisingly difficult thing to do well - your target is complete and constructive feedback, with each of your grading decisions  explained and sound advice given - that demands a thorough understanding of the course material and also of the traps and pit-falls which  are all too easy to fall into and which can, ultimately, demotivate a student if they fall foul of one and you, as the reviewer, are not 'on their side' .

9095989~COURSE!~OEZ3_J-PEeWaZBIXh-2nQw,1529571797613,5,0,"My love for Mathematics in the past few years is like the electrocardiogram (Điện tâm đồ) of a near-death patient, which is peaceful as the surface of a calm lake. This does not annoy me at all, despite for the fact that I used to be called the smartest one in class, in this specific topic particularly. Then, how did I end up like this? Fortunately, Professor Keith Devlin points out that this is not exceptional. It is not true that people are born to be good or bad at math by default, and keep up the trend till they die. In fact, there is always a transformation in mathematical thinking from high school to university level, that almost no one was told when they were students. Moving from being taught a fixed set of techniques to solve a problem, now you are asked to be able to abstract things and reason about it, which naturally confuse learners. To prepare for such transformation, this is the exact course you need.  My personal opinion: I wish that I have taken this course 5 years ago, so I can learn a bit more about Algebra. First year undergraduate students, mark my words: take it!.  Course review: In the first half of the course, Professor teaches the importance of understanding the primitive mathematical notations, how careful you should be when formulate a problem, and do not rush when attack it. The quizzes successfully demonstrate the second and third points.  In the second half, it's amazing to see how one can derive mathematical reasoning solely from the truth tables, and apply it to produce appropriate techniques to solve problems. Only now that I know it's not black magic when somebody choose an arbitrary value that I have no idea where it comes from in a proof. In the last 2 weeks, he gives us a few touch on set theory and real analysis, the two subjects that I suddenly feel attracted to, not to mention his sense of humour when introducing them ;)  Notably, throughout the whole course, Professor shows us how to evaluate a proof, and I do learn a thing or two about it. As he always says, the point of a proof is 1) establising the truth and 2) explaining it for the readers, math will be interesting once you learn its way of thinking.  I now feel more ready than ever to read a mathematical problem; specifically, where to look for in the beginning of a proof, and the abstract idea of how the authors come up with their chain of deduction.
