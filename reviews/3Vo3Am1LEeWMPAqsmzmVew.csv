So there wasn't enough effort put into the course. Of course, we can do optional homework and make more applications, but assignments like these should be mandatory. There is no package building and no swirl course building - So why do we have week 3 and 4 at all?

114285~COURSE!~3Vo3Am1LEeWMPAqsmzmVew,1450264938291,4,0,"In general, an excellent course, taught by competent professors. I believe that in the main this course does very well in achieving its objective of knowledge transfer. However, having experienced it, there were parts where the professor was demonstrating a topic using a video presentation showing him operate a process or screen sequence on his computer. These aspects, like virtually all the material on this course, are of a technical nature and contain many important details. As such, to help complete and re-enforce their learning, students require something like a sequence of slides that they can print out and retain for revision and future reference. In certain parts, the provision of the printable screenshots in the form of slides was absent.An important theme of the course and Data Science in general is ""Reproducible Research"". What I'm arguing for here is, ""Reproducible Learning Materials"" covering a complete course, not only parts of it. Admittedly, it was only a very small proportion of the course that suffers from this defect. But I would not like it to become the norm in the future. As a suggestion, it could be possible to author a lecture using HTML so as to combine the verbatum lecture text with every slide/screenshot image embedded in its right position within the lecture.I notice Coursera courses have also moved away from the weekly lists of individual lectures together with their links to .txt, .mp4, etc. files. The new presentation keeps you submerged within the flow within each week's series of lectures. One has to 'click out' in order to watch your progress and then re-enter the lectures at a resumption point. I prefer the previous navigation structure in order to access lectures and materials. Printed learning materials are also important for me, in addition to the video lectures. The latter are of course vital as the medium for the initial exposure of the material.",0,0,Deleted Account,114285

It is easy to navigate from course material to discussion boards.  I like the Quiz format, including expanding the number of choices for the multiple choice selections, but the grading was confusing.  For Quiz 3, some questions came back with multiple ""Well Done"" comments, even when I had not selected the answer for which I was being praised.  I also was told I made errors on the same question....   and this was after I answered the question (Question 2, on R generic functions) the exact same as I had answered it when I took the course earlier this year.I was not a fan of not having to take a picture to submit work, so I am pleased that is no longer a requirement.  I hope the typing pattern match is sufficient to affirm identity.I have one comment on content specific to this class.  Week 3 content lacks relevancy to the project and data products in general.  I agree that knowledge of R packages, classes, and methods is an important part of understanding R.  I am not sure where that fits in the Data Science curriculum as a whole, though.  Maybe expanding the curriculum to include a second, more advanced R class, with a project to write our own methods, build an R package, or do something with yhat.  That would assign relevant work to reinforce the lectures.I would be happy to do further beta testing.DCP",0,0,David Porcaro,9114864

Bootstrap itself is not a style, although it is used as a style guide for the development of products. Obviously this is not a big issue and people that delve into will find the facts easily. Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS, and JS front-end framework with a strong support for themes which people also call styles. Many themes/styles are available to build responsive, mobile-first web sites. Bootstrap was created by a designer and a developer at Twitter in mid-2010 and was released to the public in August 2011. It has become one of the most popular front-end frameworks and open source 
projects in the world. Bootstrap has a few easy ways to quickly get started,
 each one appealing to a different skill level and use case. ",0,0,Henk Scholten,13394706
