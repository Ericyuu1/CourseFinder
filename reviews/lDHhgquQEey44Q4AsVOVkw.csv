All of these courses have had overlap to my current workplace and the job descriptions of positions I have recently applied for.  This one specifically was something I have always had high interest in, and I believe has given me a great perspective of how to think when making presentations.  In fact, I have already referenced some of these ideas in current data visualization conversations.  I think even this course getting me to engage more in presentations is a wonderful positive from completing this course.  ",0,1,James Wade,91612877
