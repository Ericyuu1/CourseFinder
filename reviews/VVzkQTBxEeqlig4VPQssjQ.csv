28460763~COURSE!~VVzkQTBxEeqlig4VPQssjQ,1593080267391,1,0,This course could have been way better! The tutor  tells you what the code does but does not explain why we use of what the plots actually mean. you just get a ball park educated guess about what to do with the plots. the rhyme environment is laggy and unresponsive at times and it is not due to my internet connection as i have tested this in 2 different geographical locations. what this course does is shows you lots of cool graphs and you get a VERY basic sort of explanation about the graph. not worth the money as I can get a way better course on Udemy for the same money!,0,1,Raul Gonzales,28460763
