Although the skills and knowledge acquired are very relevant to me and I find them useful, there are several things I didn't like about the course.First, it seemed like there were unexplained gaps in the information acquisition; at some point I was trained to carry out an observation protocol implicitly assuming that it had already been designed, but the observation protocol design was never introduced. It feels like some content was missing from the course. Then, I tried to report it in the discussion forums about ""Issues with materials"", but never received a reply. I think that the instructors should be attentive to this forum at least, as it is the only way they can receive real-time feedback from the students with these issues.Nevertheless, I liked taking the course and doing the activities, and I think they'll be very useful for my professional development.",0,5,Daniel Morillo Cuadrado,1556786

The name of the course should be restructured to fit what it's about, interviewing and the process of interviewing. I find interviewing pretty self-explanatory, but there is information that is useful in the course video and documentation. What bothered me most was the ambiguity when it came to peer assignments, the number of peer assignments and quizzes that involve answers like ""all of the above"" or ""II and III"".  Peer assignments are an a pain to deal with, considering you have to ask other users for reviews to process, and it's mandatory to be graded before proceeding.
