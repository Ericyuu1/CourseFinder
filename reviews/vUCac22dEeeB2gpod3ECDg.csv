How do you like 4-year old TensorFlow 1.10.1?-​ The course project has a task where you need to train a few TF neural nets. This takes HOURS to run in the provided Jupyter environment. Are you crazy there? In order to solve it I had to download everything manually, replicate the old-as-my-granddad environement and run locally. This took me 3 hours that I wish I could get back.-​ Staff doesn't pay any attention to students' complaints. Just have a look at the discussion forum and how may times they replied.

The rest of this review is a repeat of my review for the previous course, but still holds true in this course. The programming assignments are left almost completely to the students guessing what they're suppose to do with little direction. There is almost no feedback on how your code has performed, except to say that your code was wrong, which you already understand from not getting the points. While I was able to achieve a passing grade in this course, it was only because of the community of students that figured things out together, but with no other reliable way of figuring the material out. The code was also rife with bugs that weren't fixed for weeks while students tried and failed over and over again to pass assignments that they simply could not pass.
