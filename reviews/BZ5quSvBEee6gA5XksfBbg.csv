I felt this way after the first course of this series, but even more so now. Yes, I understand the material, but the programming assignments really don't amount to more than ""filling in the blanks""--that doesn't really test whether or not I've mastered the material. I understand that this is terribly hard to accomplish through a MOOC, and having taught university-level courses myself, I understand how much effort is involved in doing so in the ""real world"". In either case, if I'm paying for a course, I expect to have a solid grasp on the material after completing the material, and though you've clearly put effort into assembling the programming exercises, they don't really gauge this on any level. Perhaps it would be worth considering a higher cost of the course in order to justify the level of effort required to put together assessments that genuinely put the student through their paces in order to assure that a ""100%"" mark genuinely reflects both to you and the learner that they have truly internalized and mastered the material.

Why is there a ""name"" parameter in the constructor of a variable, when should I make good use for the difference between the name at a tf level and its actual Python variable name? etc...

He not only gives the mathematical foundations and code implementations of each concept, but spends a lot of time explaining the intuition behind it, so that we grasp the concept well. It's amazing how he starts from decade old neural networks in the first video, and within 2-3 hours of lecturing, he brings us into the state-of-the-art deep learning models.

Specifically I found it difficult to follow details without the basics of differential calculus, matrix algebra, Python, and TensorFlow. One alternative is to hire a tutor, which is what I did.Although there is an active community and tutors, support from the course's owner deeplearning.ai  can be improved. For example there are comments in the forums about how long it takes deeplearning.ai to fix bugs in the code.My last suggestion for improvement is how this course is taught. There is so much content that questioning needs to be more frequent. Currently grading is done through ten multiple choice questions and a programming exercise after a week's worth of videos. While the programming exercises are good, learning would be improved significantly by including three or four questions with each video, even if they are not graded.Overall, I have the sense that deeplearning.ai has not been improving or updating this course.Nevertheless this course still deserves four stars. The presenter is well organized, articulate and enthusiastic. The entire course follows a coherent plan.  This course and its predecessor supplies a great deal of content.  Each video runs 6 - 10 minutes on average which is about the right length, However I was always stopping them to write down points to better grasp the content.As mentioned, there are a few bugs in the programming exercises. However they are rigorous, cover the material, and effort has been made to make them interesting.Overall, while there is room for improvement this is still a worthwhile course.

Many topics are explained clearly, with valuable field practitioners insight, and you are given quizzes and code-exercises that help deepen the understanding of how to implement the concepts in the videos. I would recommend to take them after the initial Andrew Ng ML course by Stanford, unless you have prior background in this topic.There are a few shortbacks:1 - the video editing is poor and sloppy. Its not too bad, but it’s sometimes can be a bit annoying.2 - most of the exercises are too easy, and are almost copy-paste. I need to go over them and create variations of them in-order to strengthen my practical skills. Some exercises are quite challenging though (especially in course 4 and 5), and I need to go over them just to really nail them down, as things scale up quickly. Course 3 has no exercises as its more theoretical. Some exercises have bugs - so make sure to look at the discussion board for tips (the final exercise has a huge bug that was super annoying).3 - there are no summary readings - you have to (re)watch the videos in order to check something, which is annoying. This is partially solved because the exercises themselves usually hold a lot of (textual) summary, with equations.4 - the 3rd course was a bit less interesting in my opinion, but I did learn some stuff from it.

The theory presented here is good, but as a learner seeing it for the first time, I didn't get a deep intuition on why we are doing a particular OT and why we need different OTs. So I learned this part from the NPTEL course on Deep Learning by Mitesh Khapra, where he first mentions the reason behind developing an OT, and then he deep dives into the implementation of the technique. In a great way, he developed the concepts on Momentum, NAG, Adagrad, RMS Prop, Adam progressively.

Currently, I do not have funds to take university courses till August and hopefully, I could secure the co-op or internship for August to December 2020 so that I can fund my remaining semester from it. I am interested in AI and Data Science field and currently, my major is in AI with Computer vision and Machine Learning. I heard very positive reviews about this Specialization course of Deep Learning from my friends and I wanted to complete it this summer so that I could cash this knowledge in my full-time job or internship hunt. Please refer me for any opportunity I am very much in need of financial support for the completion of MS degree as well as living costs. My email is km1556@rit.edu and https://www.linkedin.com/in/kunjan-mhaske is my Linkedin profile. Fortunately, Coursera offered me the financial aid for the first and second courses in this specialization which turns out to be very helpful for me in this situation. I have applied for the rest of the courses in this specialization. Hopefully, I could get financial aid for all the 5 courses. Although I have a 3.76/4.0 GPA, the depth of concepts explained in this course is very good for my level. I have completed this course in 6 days and I am already feeling confident about the field of Deep Learning. Thank you so much for this wonderful course material and your support.

I am a working professional (13+ years), but just getting into the field of ML and AI.

I believe it is useful to take this course in order and makes sense as a part of the series, though technically it is not necessary.The course covers numerous tuning strategies and optimization strategies to help seed up as well as improve the quality of the machine learning output.  It is very well planned and comprehensive (to the extent possible) -- and gives the student a very power toolbox of stratgies to attack a problem.The instructor videos are very good, usually 10 min long, and Dr. Ng tries hard to provide intution using analogies and real-life examples.  The quizzes that accompany the lectures are quite challenging and help ensure that the student has understood the material well.  The programming exercises are the best part of the course.  They help the student practice the strategies and also provide a jump-start for the student to use the code for their own problems at work or in school.  Overall, this is an excellent course.
