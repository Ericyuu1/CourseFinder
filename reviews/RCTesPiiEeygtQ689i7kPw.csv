65825913~COURSE!~RCTesPiiEeygtQ689i7kPw,1673194511254,2,0,"I would not recommend this course as a first course introduction to Agile. The material is so thin and poorly explained that you will learn nothing. There are more links to articles than video content or lectures. I did well because this is my 5th Agile course, which I am using to ensure I know Scrum like the back of my hand before I take my PSM certification. But if I hadn't already learned so much I'm sure I would have failed those exams miserably. You would do better to start with Google's PM specialization, then move to IBM (who is second to Google in their content). from there you can then try this one or the Darden course, but so far none of them (including the Agile Leadership which was a complete waste of time) provide as much insight as the previous mentioned courses. I will be trying Hong Kong Uni and Illinois next. I hope at least one of them is as good, but so far none of them have been as informative. This was by far the least. ",0,1,Ashley Garcia ,65825913
