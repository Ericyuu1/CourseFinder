However, there are so many mistakes here. idk how its so highly rated, maybe people just watch the videos without trying the code out for themselves. Because a lot of information/code shown is just plain wrong.Don't enroll in this course if your primary objective is to learn python as there are many far better python introductory courses out there. However, if you already know basic python, this course is a great way of getting introduced to new and advanced concepts (enumeration, map, filter, tests etc).All in all, i'm disappointed as the previous course (introduction to back end development) was quite good",0,2,Vikas Rawat,119453528

Let me list a few issues I had with the course: I ran into a few bugs/errors such as broken links or missing diagrams. The order of the lessons seems off. Examples were not always explained well enough or there were no examples given.What I mean by the order being off is that they teach you some things such as the types of programming at the end of the course when you need to use it at the beginning. So when you are doing the first few programming assignments you use skills/functions/information only given after that assignment. It's like when a teacher gives you a project and then doesn't teach the subject until after the project has been turned in. Just reorder the lessons so that it flows better.What I mean by the examples is, unless you already know what they are talking about sometimes the examples are not detailed enough to understand how the program/function works. Sometimes an example will be given using a short description but then does not demonstrate/show how it would be used/written/implimented.I would say this is not a course for true beginners. You need some previous knowledge and experience using python to follow along. If I had not already used python before this course I would not be able to follow along without researching outside of the course. While self-research is not a bad thing, it defeats the purpose of paying for the course, and might as well just have a test to get the certification instead of a whole course. In conclusion, I am glad I took the course as I learned some good things from it. However the course seems rough and could use some minor tweaks to make it better. ",0,0,Noah Grayhek,46009555

106759622~COURSE!~2jTqHscpEeyduw6ktL3Xvw,1663301991461,3,0,"T​his course is very close to being excellent in many respects, but it has some very serious issues that make it a frustrating experience.  The production quality is very good and the course includes some material that most Python courses completely overlook.  In particular, I am very impressed that the course dedicates a week to talking about different programming paradigms.  H​ere are the issues. The single greatest problem I have is the speed at which very technical and complex aspects of Python get introduced.  You'll have a 3-4 minute video that gives one or two quickly glossed over examples of something without any serious explanation and then the video will conclude with ""and now you know how X works.""  If any of this is even remotely new to you, you'll have points where the course glosses over crucial information without providing you serious explanations about how and why something is done a certain way.  You won't progress easily by just rewatching the videos over and over because they don't tell you very much.  It's also a serious flaw of the course that really important information just gets dumped into the readings for the course when a lot of that material deserves to be in video form.  When you get stuck, the suggestion is to just go and read more elsewhere, but there's a point at which this gets ridiculous--the course itself should be suffient to learn the material.  S​econd, I think the programming exercises are overcomplicated and needlessly so.  I never felt prepared for what I was tackling in these exercises because they often involved doing things that were more complicated than any of the examples given in any of the videos.  There's a difficulty gap here, and I think it's a serious flaw of the course. The exercises are also pretty long, and usually involve writing lots of functions based on pseudocode directions that are ambiguous enough that you may very well misinterpret what is expected of you, do a bunch of unnecessary work, and then have to redo it all once you realize that you mistook what the intended problem was.  This is so frustrating.  It feels like you lose a lot of time and it doesn't really help you learn anything.  T​hird, when you get stuck because you can't figure out how to do something that wasn't explained very clearly, you'll inevitably turn to the forum.  But the forum for every exercise is filled with people posting the answers.  Most of these posts have been up for weeks or months, and nobody maintaining the course seems to care.  Once you've seen any of these posts (which are unavoidable), it feels like the challenge of the exercise is wasted and it's no longer a serious learning opportunity.  I'm personally pretty torn by this.  If you aren't prepared to do the exercise because the material wasn't sufficient for you to understand what you are doing, it seems like it's the course designer's fault that you are stuck and you can't get any meaningful feedback.  It sort of pushes people to just go looking for the answers to the exercises to figure out why they are stuck.  It may still be a valuable learning experience if the learner really tries to understand and does adequate research, but the easy path of just copying and pasting things from the course forum will probably undermine the effectiveness of the exercises for most people.  When was the last time anyone you knew in school learned anything in a class when they had access to the answer key the whole time?  Again, the exercises can be designed better so that people aren't steered into the direction of just looking for the answers.  F​inally, I think there are noticeable errors in the videos.  The forums are filled with people pointing them out.  One noticeable one was the palindrome example in the video.  The code in the video doesn't actually check if the word is a palindrome because it doesn't iterate through the whole string.  It simply just checks the first and last characters. The problem is that it is presented as if it is a solution to a problem and it's just not.  This kind of stuff is really annoying to anyone who has programmed before, but it's seriously confusing to new programmers and people will waste tons of time trying to figure out what is going on.  Y​ou can make this course a lot better.  Fix the mistakes and provide more video content with worked out examples.  You can even make it optional content.  Doing this would very much fill in the gap between the videos and the exercises.  ",0,20,Richard Creek,106759622
111600839~COURSE!~2jTqHscpEeyduw6ktL3Xvw,1661874450536,3,0,"The very basics of Python and programming are covered in this course, but it lacks any in-depth explanation regarding core concepts and Python specific features. There's not much info in this course about what goes on ""under the hood"" and that can leave you wanting for more and better explanation.

49108100~COURSE!~2jTqHscpEeyduw6ktL3Xvw,1670474644118,5,0,"I rated 5 stars because after going through a dozen Python intro tutorials I found this course to deliver a certain kind of content to the fullest. This course takes a broad approach and covers a wide range of topics in python. It also goes through the theory, the WHYs, and the benefits of things quite well. 

It does NOT cover topics in depth, keep that in mind. But you really don't need that, once you go through this course you will be comfortable with python syntax and will have a decent understanding of most topics in Python. Use this and go build games or programs in Python to get the depth and fluency you need. You can do this by following tutorials on youtube but those will require you to know Python beforehand and this course would have given you all the info you need to get started with projects right away.

 One thing I can claim about this course is that it's better than every ""Python Tutorial for Beginners"" and covers almost everything they will and more in a very organized fashion. One thing it didn't cover is Python Virtual Machines and type hinting but those aren't a big deal.

Recommendation: Don't ignore the ""additonal resource"" section at the end of every module, for example, If you go through the articles of ""Realpython.com"" they will provide you with more content, so if you really want to learn more about a topic covered in a module then use that additonal resource section.
