85449329~COURSE!~vTfefpnKEeqXRg45DDUIXQ,1649108631295,2,0,"Not a completely terrible introduction, but there are no materials to refer back to but a few online articles. The course maybe takes 30 hours if you stretch it out. The assignments are terrible and for that reason alone this course should be suspended until amended. I hope that the actual university behind this produces better materials for the sake of their students. ",0,0,Thijs Krugers,85449329

94958116~COURSE!~vTfefpnKEeqXRg45DDUIXQ,1634725892143,4,0,"T​he course content is very nice. What would make it better is give out one uniform example across all modules so the learner can actually get a feel of a comprehensive project from the very first phase (root causes analysis) to the finish line (execution plan specifics). Another area of improvement that would make the course even more valuable is actual application per module providing and asking for more specifics on how to apply DOE, or Lean or Six sigma. All and all, very informative. ",0,0,Ghadeer Abdulrauf Alrumaih,94958116
