Many terms introduced within the course are not explained in detail, and are simply glossed over. I appreciated the historical section of this course, but the course then took a direct nosedive into the technicalities of some of the devices (telephony network, signals etc etc), such that the content may not be at a level commensurate with the learner. The course description did mention that the course ""provides a core grounding... appropriate for any learner"". This opinion is also shared by several previous learners of the Coursera community. Two, for most of the course, save for the first, and last two modules, the questions were completely unrelated, and required extensive Googling for the answer. This, in essence, defeats the purpose of having a quiz, as it should be used to gauge the level of content understanding. You could perceive the quizzes as a more legitimate-looking version of a trivia game like Quizup.From this introductory course alone, in terms of lecturers, Ganz presented better than Harinath. Harinath digressed a lot, and was not very engaging. Ganz related better, although this could be down to the nature of content.
