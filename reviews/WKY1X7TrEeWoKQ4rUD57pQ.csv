48593377~COURSE!~WKY1X7TrEeWoKQ4rUD57pQ,1583652776785,4,0,"A lot of good things here: Material is important; the course is interesting; professor is very knowledgeable and communicates clearly. The range of topics - from energy to education - is informative and relevant. A few things that could be improved: 1) The course is quite dated and on a topic like this, not being current is a major weakness. Coursera needs a new edition. 2) A fair number of the questions on the quizzes are niggling, focusing on tiny, unimportant details. 3) Many of the slides are hard to read - rows of numbers that should be graphs, etc. All of these things are addressable and would make a meaningful difference.",0,1,Peter Allen,48593377

politics are extremely complicated, especially for anyone coming from non
communist states.  This course is a very
good introductory course on Chinese politics. China is the world’s second
largest economy and one of the most influential countries today. The Middle
Kingdom has a very unique political system. The professor is excellent and the institution
providing this course is a world class university.  I took Part I and Part II of this course. I
really enjoyed both courses. I think even Chinese people would learn a great
deal during this course. （我建议大家上这门课）",0,0,Angel Villegas,1377044
