71549590~COURSE!~76y61ht8EemDxxJ40YD1SA,1602664374812,4,0,"Good overview of some selected methods. Not all algorithms that are relevant for the subject are covered, there is not enough time for that. However, more detailed material is provided. The videos are sometimes inconsistent. Obviously parts of a larger course have been taken out to put this short one together. So there are soemtimes references to content that was supposedly already covered, but actually didn't happen. But this does not limit the learning possibilities any further. It is a pity that there are soemtimes no sample solutions for exercises. The answer keys for the assignments are sometimes very short. Detailed explanations and justifications would be desirable here. All in all, the course is ok to get an insight into the subject matter in quite a short time, but it ca be improved. If you are looking for an in-depth discussion of the topic, you are in the wrong place.",0,0,Felix Rothe,71549590

For example, the key concepts of model tuning should have been elaborated further or some of the other practical uses cases of of models in business decision making could have been included. Note. The intent of this course is not to teach machine learning or data science but how to apply these principles to a business problem. However, once some of these gaps are closed this is going to be definitely a 5-star course!",0,0,Subhajyoti Chanda,39935057

I don't think anyone other than students ever checks them, which is not good - one of the reasons I had to transfer to another class was because of the lack of response on the discussion forums. Other than that, this was a good class though.",0,1,Logan Vaz,47979069
