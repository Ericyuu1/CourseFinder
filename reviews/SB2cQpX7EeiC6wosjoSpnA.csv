Throughout the course each of Brightline ten guiding principles to shrink the costly and wasteful gap between strategy design and delivery and turning great ideas into real results has been discussed, applied to real life examples and then discussed by top business executives and academics, to name a few (and in no particular order):
- Rita G. McGrath of Columbia Business School; 
- Martin Reeves of Boston Consulting Group (BCG);
- Mohammed Al-Abbadi of Saudi Telecom Company (STC);
- Perry Keenan of Boston Consulting Group (BCG);
- Roger Martin of the Rotman School of Management;
- Sunil Prashara President and CEO of PMI;
- Vijay Govindarajan of the Tuck School of Business;
- and Jeroen Tas Chief Innovation & Strategy Officer of Royal Philips.

Many thanks for Brightline and Ricardo Viana Vargas (the course instructor and Executive Director of the Brightline Initiative™) for this course.

I highly recommend this course

WHAT'S IN FOR LEADERS who want to see their ideas turn into results? The Brightline Course dives into the ""Strategic & Business Management"" dimension of the PMI Talent Triangle, highlighting knowledge of and expertise in the industry/organization. - For Next-Gen Leaders, the course offers awareness of strategic alignment as a success factor for their teams' work.
