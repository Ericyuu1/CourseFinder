There are many one-line codes which are very very long. They are not easy to understand due to little explanation. ",0,0,Zhilin Zhang,186691

45563671~COURSE!~BcqTyPt8EeqQ2ArFmTUfww,1642974242225,3,0,"This course uses the Coursera in-browser notebook processer, Rhyme, rather than Google Colab, Python, or Anaconda. If you want to use Pyspark on your home computer or work computer, this tutorial will not show you how to get there. You will need to seek out those instructions separately and install Python/Java/Spark yourself. The instructor demonstrates quite a few functions and methods that will help you to get started with Pyspark, though he does not go into much depth about any of them. You will understand the statements and operations in this course much better if you have a solid understanding of Python, and at least a basic understanding of SQL commands. In my opinion, this course was worth the $10 I paid.",0,0,Jeremy Styborski,45563671

Of course coursera gives me a small discount for having already paid it previously.
It is very easy to download the videos and difficult to get hold of the material, but with ingenuity it is possible. Then I recommend uploading them to YouTube and keeping them private for when they want to consult (they avoid legal problems and can share with friends), then they can request a refund.
