39821380~COURSE!~VRU4HtDXEeiCWw7c2M_UPA,1579458349466,5,0,Another excellent course - lots of great breakdowns and overviews into these components of computational thinking.  It also provided (as did all the courses in this specialization) a lot of materials that could immediately be used in class.  I had fun taking this course and looked forward to sharing some of its components!,0,0,Margaret Macalister,39821380
