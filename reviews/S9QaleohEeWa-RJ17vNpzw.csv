23520659~COURSE!~S9QaleohEeWa-RJ17vNpzw,1670921354770,4,0,The course is great!  But the textbook is far more advanced than the contents offered throughout the course.  Suggest to cover more topics in the textbook as many there are found really interesting but just too technical to understand without lecture guidance.,0,0,Lik Ming Cheong,23520659
639941~COURSE!~S9QaleohEeWa-RJ17vNpzw,1656364008016,4,0,"I​n terms of lectures and content, this was easily a five star course. However, a few of the test questions were wrong and the forums show them to have been so for years without fixing. I conclude that the people responsible have simply abandoned the course, leaving learners to themselves. Thankfully this was a minor issue, but I still knock one star off. :)",0,0,Jonas Karlsson,639941

52123085~COURSE!~S9QaleohEeWa-RJ17vNpzw,1588754913607,5,0,"This is my first course on Coursera. I've found it among set of Ivy League free courses, advertised on the Internet due to Coronavirus. The topic is very interesting - on standard discrete mathematic courses on mathematical or IT studies, generating functions are treated very softly. Here I could learn many great things. Second part of course may be a little bit harder for IT students who do not have previous knowledge about complex analysis.",0,4,Maciej Ficek,52123085

The instructor, a most prominent figure in the field of combinatorics, explains advanced mathematical notions without sacrificing rigor. I appreciated the option to retake quizzes as many times as one wants, even after passing them, to test one's understanding and assimilation of the concepts.",0,4,Silvio Capobianco,130450
