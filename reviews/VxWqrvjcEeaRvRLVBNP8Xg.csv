93553788~COURSE!~VxWqrvjcEeaRvRLVBNP8Xg,1639680059732,1,0,"I​'m so disapointed by this course. Profesors are great but materials (for doing something in Unity) are so bad and outdated. You literaly have to do everything by yourself. Like examples are non-existential and materials also and outdated. You need to go google everything out and try it for yourself for 100 times before you manage do to what is asked. The parts where profesors talk about VR are good and informational but everything else is just so bad. I dont have so much time to research everything on my own, thats why I bouth this course (and I finished first 2 chapeters and started 4th one) but it think I will just leave it and unsubsribe. Like expanations on how to do something in Unity dont exist at all! If you try it yourself you will see it. ",0,1,Stefan Salapura,93553788

34453037~COURSE!~VxWqrvjcEeaRvRLVBNP8Xg,1601549462227,4,0," A fair warning before starting, I really think you should have some basic Unity knowledge before taking this class. This was again a great lecture by the team at Goldsmith University. Unlike the vr environment course, which had a few parts that I felt were not really VR related, this one has an excellent theoretical part!By the end of the course, you know about the different solutions that exist to implement movement and object interaction. The course also clearly emphasizes good practices in VR design, such as how to make things intuitive.Working on an interactive project is also really cool, but this part is more about the students' involvement: if you want to do it seriously, you will learn a lot. However, I feel that there could be an improvement here about how projects should be graded. Sharing full unity project is often cumbersome, and the project only gain in size as the course progresses. Maybe we could only share the build or the apk through a safe server that would check for viruses before letting us download it?Finally, forums are as usual, completely abandoned, I am not even sure I found one message from a moderator (let alone an instructor). But it is kind of touching to see those 3 years old messages, dating from a time where the forums were not flooded by requests for reviews. Like a glance to a golden age of the coursera vr course.",0,0,Ian Cherabier,34453037

This course was very helpful in giving its students an introduction to interaction, theories of interaction, and the actual implementation of it within virtual reality and Unity projects. While some of the material taught in the course - namely the sorts of installation files being downloaded and the type of code being run on Unity - is deprecated and outdated, the discussion forum is a fantastic place to reference for solving these issues. You can look at the projects of other learners who've found alternative ways to complete the project requirements and learn from their scripts and components. All in all, still a very fulfilling course.",0,0,"Collins, Jazmin B",55179731
