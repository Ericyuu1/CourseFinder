36948545~COURSE!~eVrrS8E_EeWP5g5dlaZx4w,1662563870385,3,0,"The course is more about psychophysics rather than neuroscience. It is relatively the combination of psychology and neuroscience (more psychology but it can inspire thoughts about neuronal pathway). Personally I have alternative thoughts against some of the ideas in this course. The empirical thoughts explain everything using human experience. But the lecturer took it as a fact rather than a hypothesis that needs testing. Obviously there are correlation between those factors but it is really the ‘reason’? Human experience is a vague word. What part or aspect of experience is related to the perception is not explained or at least mentioned. For example, in the geometry section, my hypothesis would be it was caused by perspective: We artificially put identical figures into picture with perspective (reflection of 3D world). Our brain will analysis the context according to the experience of the real world and then define curving, distortion or depth at different sites of this imagine. By retrospective referring, the analyses about figures at different locations will differ. So it could be, not the perception, but the analyses (information processing in parts of the prefrontal cortex, higher ‘level’ of visual cortex etc. which shares the similar structures in cerebellum) that gives ‘illusions’. The data from ‘Frequency of Occurrence of Angles’ is too good to be true. Again, the explanation of the angel perception is not credible enough. If this ‘illusion’ is based on human experience, it is imaginable to do similar behavioural test on human babies to see the actual window and amount of experience that a human need to gain this psychophysical discrepancy. (Genetical and structural analysis is also applicable) In the courses of motion, it will be better to have video for demonstration. After all, it is a very inspiring course and it generates a perspective of view for (potential) neuroscientists.
