68637~COURSE!~2y_2_3REEeWKsgrp3VnvAw,1503319334168,1,0,"The whole specialization is a bit of a mixed bag... Many of the courses rely too heavily on teaching R programming and not sufficiently on data science concepts (such statistics or machine learning). The instructors (specially Peng) spent way too much time detailing R syntax that could have been picked up by the students on their own from other resources available on the web...The regression models and statistical inference courses are exceptions though: Together with the machine learning course, these are probably the most useful from the whole specialization.The materials in this capstone project are way sloppier than materials in other courses by the way. They lack structure and feel confusing. I'm not even sure if the instructors tried to implement the proposed project themselves to have a base of reference.  Feels like they were already growing tired of the whole thing and put the capstone project together in a hurry without much thought or care.The theme of the project is indeed interesting (text-mining and NLP), but I think that would have been more productive for me to take a NLP course instead. You are going to use very little from what you have learned from the other courses in the specialization (for the most part the data product course) and you will need to learn text-mining and NLP from scratch on your own to complete the capstone (no videos nor materials available in the course on these subjects).Also, if I was going to implement the same app on my own these days, I would probably use RNNs, not Katz Back-off and Markov Transition Matrices as in the capstone and I would probably use SparkR. Heck, I might not even use R, probably Scala or Python with Spark instead. In short, data science moves fast and this course already feels very outdated...The instructors seem quite experienced in statistical analysis, so it's a shame that they decided to focus so heavily on R programming instead... That would have made the specialization more resilient to technological innovations in the field...The specialization surely could be improved and these issues corrected, but all courses seem pretty much abandoned by the instructors. Most of the courses still have active ""mentors"" (volunteers not associated with Coursera nor Johns Hopkins) , but ""mentors"" seem to have lost contact with the instructors: For example, a couple of assignments require data that is no longer available (dead links) and ""mentors"" have provided this data in the discussion fora. I reckon that if ""mentors"" could contact instructors, the dead links would have been fixed in the materials by now...The peer-grading doesn't work so well... Most of the submissions I graded were painful to review (extremely low quality). Not surprisingly, the graders were also pretty low-skilled. They can't even understand the requirements (and I suspect not even the English language) and they will take points from correct submissions. I urge any employers to look at the actual code for this capstone from candidates given the general incompetence and poor skills of the students I graded. The grading criteria is pretty relaxed, so even though I would like to fail them, I still had to give them a passing grade. Such a weak grading criteria is detrimental to all people who actually have the skills and put hard work on their submissions.

Why do you ask?  Well, most of the class was just about learning natural language processing (NLP), which wasn't covered.  What about R programming, you ask?  Most of the NLP packages in R that I tested out couldn't process a 200MB text file in a reasonable amount of time or with a reasonable memory footprint.  I ran Python and R programs in parallel to do sentence and word tokenization, and Python's nltk was (not exaggerating) 100x faster than R's NLP package, and R's tm package took 4GB of memory to parse the same 200MB corpus.  In 2018, that's just unacceptable.  There's no way you could ever write production-quality NLP code using these R packages.  After the course was finished, someone pointed out an R package that could adequately accomplish the task, but by then it was far too late.  Even R's basic data structures themselves weren't up to the challenge. I ended up building my model in Python, exporting it as JSON, and then importing that into my Shiny app.  Comparing basic data structures in Python and R to represent the same JSON file (i.e., just read in the file and measure the size of the resulting object), R's list was nearly 2x as large in RAM than Python's dict.  All of this combined with really very little reference to most of the material in the other nine classes in this track left me very disappointed.  The reason I gave the class two stars and not one was because what we did learn about NLP was useful.  Having to solve a gnarly, real-world problem starting from raw data is useful.  Having to write an app with actual users interacting with it is useful.  But could just about everything about this class have been done a lot better?  Yes.

There was no involvement from the professors at JHU or the folks at SwiftKey. As was mentioned in another review, the course feels abandoned. All you get a few short (two minutes or so) videos that give you little in the way of instruction or direction. Basically, they just say, ""Go do this. Good luck!""There were also no Mentors or TAs to guide students or answer questions. It was the students helping each other through the forums. Sometimes it was helpful and everyone involved learned something. Other times, it was the blind trying to lead the visually-impaired.  On a positive note, you will use all of the skills from the previous courses: writing R functions, performing exploratory analysis and publishing it via RPubs. Your final product will be displayed for everyone via ShinyApps and a presentation using R Presentation (also published via RPubs).On a(nother) negative note, the topic of Natural Language Processing is not an easy one to just walk into and feel confident in providing a working next-word prediction algorithm in about eight (8) weeks. You're reading academic journal articles, watching multiple videos from another Coursera course (which actually focuses on the topic of NLP, and takes place over several courses and several months!).Supposedly, there is work going on to update the course, so hopefully future students will get a better experience.  I did take a bit away from this course, especially since I made more than one attempt to complete it. However, it was definitely a shock to find myself missing those things that one typically finds in a learning environment -- descriptive background, assistance to problems, etc. -- and seeing that I was for all intents and purposes on my own. Even in the professional world of data analysis, I have never experienced the lack of support that I found in this course.With that, I am giving it three (3) stars.  As I said, I did learn a bit, but it was a bit of a struggle that required multiple attempts to complete.  This would have been better off as a stand alone topic (which it already is by another Coursera affiliated school), or having a capstone course that builds on a topic more in the wheelhouse of the JHU professors: a capstone project focusing on bioinformatics or biostatistics would have been amazing in comparison to this.",0,1,Richard Ian Carpenter,11230828

I get that you will always see new data formats as a data scientist, but having the whole course cover numeric data and then having the final project be on text data where you can't apply what you learned seems sub-optimal. Also, to me it seemed that the accuracy increased mostly with how much data you train your algorithms on, and not so much how you design your algorithm. My second issue is that the class only starts every two months, and the assignments are blocked before the session starts so you can't see them if you're trying to get a head start. What happened to everyone learning at their own pace? I have a lot to do and had to switch sessions at least once for most classes, and this class was really stressful for me because I didn't want to move my completion back by two months. Lastly, I really hate RPresenter and that the instructors force us to use it, but maybe that's just me.On the positive side, I did learn a lot: The basics of text prediction, how to do parallel programming in R and how to set up an RStudio instance on AWS (the latter two are not very hard, I recommend them to anyone struggling with gigantic runtimes, as long as you're willing to invest like $40 or so for the computing power). I liked that the guidelines were very broad, so there was a lot of room for creativity.

Not having any knowledge of Natural Language Programming, I found Youtube videos and presentations from the Stanford class taught by Dan Jurafsky and Christopher Manning. Study it up to the explanation of n-grams, it should be enough for the class.  I completed the first weeks in few days so I had more time to actually build the model and the app (you'll need more than the scheduled weeks if you have no prior experience). I found valuable resources in the course forum. Then you're pretty much on your own, identify the best packages, how to use them, look on Stack Overflow when you get stuck. Start using a very small set of data so you can quickly build the model and the app until you get something that works. After that you can improve the model by using more data, finding the balance between processing time, app  time response and prediction accuracy. Everyone understands the limitation of the project so give importance to quickness rather than accuracy.My overall evaluation of the project is a mixed bag. The positive is that it introduces you to a new topic (NLP) and the goal is reasonable, it takes a lot of effort but it's not impossible and it forces you to learn something meaningful (something easier would have not made me learn something valuable). The negative is that there is no explanation whatsoever about NLP, which was never mentioned in the previous courses, so there's not much teaching or guidance.

If you've worked to ensure you truly understand the concepts, tools and techniques presented in the prerequisite courses, you will be able to complete this project. The problem domain is a little different from most of the examples in the prerequisite courses. I find that a good thing. Whenever I learn something I believe to be useful, I always wonder how it applies in other contexts. This course was an exercise in doing just that — applying what you've learned to a ""new"" (i.e., new to me) a domain.Heads up / Be aware:  If you're ""like me"" — inexperienced with NLP, and one of those people who doesn't feel quite right about using a recommended toolset or algorithm until I understand why it's the right tool for the job — you should start reading up on the basics of text mining, NLP and next-word prediction models 1-2 weeks before you start the course. For some, that might be overkill; but I'm a slow reader at the end of a workday (we all have day jobs, right!?). Given this foundational understanding, I felt comfortable making tradeoffs among the state-of-the-art and the practical, given the project objectives, my own time constraints, etc. Reading the course forums and reviews, I think some who had trouble completing the project weren't able to take sufficient time to get oriented with this domain before attempting to build their first word prediction model.Note:  By ""foundational"", I mean enough to intuitively grasp why what's accepted as best practice is that. When I've read about someone's approach to solving a problem, and I'm able to say ""makes sense, but I probably don't need to do X or Y to meet the need for this effort"", then that's often enough… But :-) because I at times overthink things (don't we all!), I get a little more comfortable when I at least skim over descriptions of how a couple others have solved a similar problem; and I can see patterns of convergence… I do NOT mean enough to write your own thesis, unless that's what you really want to do. Whatever floats your boat! LOLI have a software development background (and completed the previous courses in the specialization), so translating approaches I found described in various sources into code wasn't ""easy""; but it wasn't a barrier, either. I was helped along GREATLY by the existence of R packages such as tm and tokenizers, and I was always able to find guidance on addressing thorny issues via ""good ole Google Search"". Most often, my searches would lead me to StackOverflow or write-ups from capstone project alumni. While I did my own write-ups and wrote my own code, I benefited in a big way from lessons learned by others who've already tackled similar problems.I would recommend the Data Science Specialization by JHSU, which (as it should be) is a package deal with the capstone project.

91849356~COURSE!~2y_2_3REEeWKsgrp3VnvAw,1646059151084,5,0,"In data science, two of the best specializations taught by the Coursera platform are from The JHU and IBM. There are many comparative assessments to choose which would be the best choice according to the profile of the postulant. It's probably worth doing both. In any case, I ratify jhu's data science expertise, in the sense that it is quite rich, deepens very little explored topics in regular undergraduate courses, and is directed specifically to statistics and big data. It assumes that the student has a good basis of mathematics and statistics of higher level and good knowledge base in R. I say only good base, because the R is quite vast, and the specific classes of programming in R are sequenced, practically from scratch, but of well accelerated progression. In some more specific topics, I had to complement the knowledge with very objective and punctual parallel courses, such as the themes of the DataCamp platform, which serves well to unlock some punctual subject. StackOverFlow's help and feedback alsocomes as a great help at all levels of learning, including professor Roger Peng's first lesson: knowing how and where to seek help to move forward, that is, the first major lesson in data science is the humility of being an astronaut in a virtually infinite universe,and expanding every day. This is the most fascinating of Data Science, Biostatistics and R: the themes never run out and become concatenated in the face of the phenomena that surround us daily. From there, the sequence of 10 courses represents a long way (not so long for some) of development, feedbacks, evaluations and model building in R. Undoubtedly an excellent specialization, which is worth the investment, especially time. The final part of the specialization represents the last steps, but the steepest of the journey. In the latter, in particular, metaphorically you are confronted with yourself, a feeling of having been blindfolded in the middle of a dense dark forest, and now need to find your way back using what you have learned so far. For all specialization graduates it is a stage of relief, rather than celebration. The percentage of evasion of specialization from the first course is very large. In a master's and doctorate, I believe it is a specialization of great support, for the publication of studies and analysis of field data, in order to reach assertive conclusions from hypothesis tests. Upon completion of the specialization, JHU encourages the publication of the Certificate of Completion on LinkedIn and, with this, you receive an invitation from Professor Brian Caffo, after a brief verification of authenticity (around 1 week), to join a private Data Science group moderated by him, where there are excellent networking opportunities with other scientists,partnerships, job opportunities and project development.  ",0,4,Marcos da Silva Medeiros,91849356

Now I turned around to remember some topics and started reading comments.  I found many comments that say the final project has nothing to do with the previous 9 courses and when I did it I thought the same.  Looking at it in perspective, I think the previous courses are absolutely necessary for the final project. The objective of carrying out a project with such characteristics is to apply the knowledge by oneself.  The first courses of programming in R, extraction and cleaning, and exploratory analysis are fundamental to understand the problem. In this case the cleaning has to do with the transformations using regular expressions and tokenization. The exploratory analysis should be done in any data science project, otherwise you may encounter surprises when implementing the models.  Statistical inference was necessary and closely linked to exploratory analysis, especially to select samples well and review distributions, since some machine learning methods may be affected by distributions. I must say that I did not see this when I took this course, but it was because of my lack of experience. Maybe there was a lack of guidance.  The algorithm I used was regression on the ngrams for simplicity, time and capacity of my computer, but it could have been combined with other methods such as neural networks or svm.  Implementing the model in shiny and then adjusting it because it was very heavy was also interesting.  As a summary, I really liked this specialization and although it was very hard and many times I did not know how to move forward (especially in the capstone), I think the challenge was important for my learning and I was very entertained.",0,4,Carlos Saquel,36700738

While there was a difference in level of difficulty between the individual courses, it is probably unavoidable given the range of subject areas. I think it would be great improvement if there was a additional 'post-grad' 'course'-like few weeks to connect to industry that is hiring from this background and get those connections to lead the 'grads' into real job interviews; Also, more projects that are direct connection to the industry, like the capstone - where those project would be dine perhaps in some kind of cooperation with the industry reps, so that graduate student here has direct path and had already worked with people that might hire him/her, where the time spent working on the capstone project includes meeting with the reps from the industry whom would have interest in the work.  Something along the lines of grants for university projects (not talking about money here) but of a connection to the needs of the industry. Students working on that if they deliver good and interesting results would have one foot into the new job.

Although you will need information gained in the previous nine modules, the Capstone Project requires you to work on a long and difficult problem using your own initiative.  Mentors, tutors and Swiftkey employees are lacking throughout this project.I worked through many different R packages to generate the word prediction N-Grams because R has a tendency to run out of memory.  Many students are forced to use a cut down version of the three million lines of text because of memory issues but I managed to find the proverbially needle in the R packages haystack that allowed me to use  the entire dataset!I had problems 
with publishing the presentation to RPubs - it just would not work using either RStudio or RConsole but at least I had a fall back position of placing the presentation on my own website.
It took me three attempts to complete this project, nine months (Jan-Sep 2016) and about 300 hours in total, I didn't give up so nor should you, you can do it!  And Good Luck!
