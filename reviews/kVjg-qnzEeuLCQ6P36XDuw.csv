It uses regex concepts so if you aren't familiar with it, the instructions given might not make a lot of sense. But if you still follow along with the instructor, you might be able to pick up and make sense of the codes used. The instructor was clear and the work was interesting. I just hope there will be a bit more conceptual explanations for beginners in Python. ",0,0,A. Singh,55758521
