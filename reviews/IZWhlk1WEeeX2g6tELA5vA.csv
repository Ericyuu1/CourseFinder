The practical exercises are interesting, when they work. However, I discovered several dead links in the recommended reading assignments and practical application instructions. Lastly, the exam for week one seemed remarkably impractical, as it contained questions about specific scenarios that did were not covered in the course material. Additionally, MANY questions contained extremely poor grammar or structure and quite frankly made little to no sense. I am a big fan of Coursera and purchased an annual subscription after enjoying a course in R and Python, and was very much looking forward to this course.

It is far from what I've expected the course to be. A few notes on my disappointment: 1) The course relies heavily on creating an AWS VM, but the student codes provided are invalid. The professor doesn't address the situation on the forums and said VM is no longer available at AWS, effectively making the first week a ""do the best you can do with what you've got"" kind of scenario. It's unprofessional. 2) The course encourages the study of specific historical knowledge (i.e. what happened with Korean hackers) and it is not what I expected. I signed up thinking I was going to be getting a technical approach with hands on experience, instead I got tested on historical events that barely relate to what I was trying to learn. 3) The overall experience is that this is an outdated method of learning that has been brought over to Coursera. I took the liberty of following the links to the professor's website at the given university and apparently he hasn't published anything in years, so I question his ability to teach anything new related to Infosec.Again: Thank you very much for the financial aid, but I'll be trying out another course.kind regards!",0,2,galimba,24430351
