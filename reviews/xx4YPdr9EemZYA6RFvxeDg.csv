But, I only assigned it three stars for two reasons.1. It left many practical issues unanswered. For example, while there was frequent reference to a cryptocurrency wallet, and its conceptual function was made clear, there was no explanation of how to create one.2. While it was described as an entry level course, a substantial knowledge of the terminology of both finance and IT was assumed and used by the lecturer. ",0,1,Robert J Malone,35920933
