76842011~COURSE!~_GNP9Il0EeqAGQ5p7POy_w,1632096642436,1,0,"1/5 startsTLDR: instructors do not explain how models work very well, just give ways to apply themNotebooks are good material however the instructor does not do a good job at all ramping the explanation of model complexity from the lectures to the applications. A major problem with this course is that the instructors promote a ""black box"" mentality, that is, do not explain to many lengths how the models work and gloss over many mathematical concepts and tell the users to just trust that it works and implement the API. I do not agree with this method of teaching is it cultivates a dangerous environment for data scientists/ analystics etc. To understand how to implement a model without having a high level understanding of the inner workings is not a practical approach and will lead to catastrophes when being rolled into production in industry. I would encourage the instructors to fully audit the course material especially for the last 2 weeks of the course and provide more comprehensive material on the math behind the models rather than just referring to wikipedia pages.

76397458~COURSE!~_GNP9Il0EeqAGQ5p7POy_w,1627317105564,2,0,"This course was added to the Intro to ML certificate. The material is useful for a data analyst/ML practitioner, but the presentation is not at the level of the other courses. The introductory labs introduce the concepts of time series analysis well, with hands-on examples, but the discussion of AR, MA, and ARIMA models is muddled and the labs for these models are not well constructed (this is the only course in this series where I felt I had to go to other sources in order to understand some of the basic concepts) . The course would be improved with a more detailed walk thru of the steps in building ARIMA models (the Box-Jenkins criteria were not covered in lecture?). The prophet module and the DL lessons seem sort of tacked on -- I would have benefitted from more explanation of how to design a DL model to handle a time series analysis. Overall, I think this topic is a good addition to the corpus, but the specific design and presentation of the material is ineffective. ",0,3,R Wray,76397458
77435468~COURSE!~_GNP9Il0EeqAGQ5p7POy_w,1617963591004,2,0,"Interesting course with a whole bunch of new algorithms! Although great work from the tutor in explaining all those slides and the codes, still sadly, I would again point out that the Accent is really really hard to comprehend, inspite of the fact that English is like my native language.Secondly, in the latter half of the course, specially in the labs for Arima, Sarima, FB prophet etc. where there is a whole bunch of complex new information to be digested, the pace in the labs feels to be apparently very rushed and haphazard. There are too many concepts presented together but in the end it remains still quite unclear the sequence in which these methods could be applied to solve real world problems. Helpful would be to use more real world Data Sets than Toy sets and show the sequence in which all these different Algorithms could be applied together on the same data set, to compare their performances.Nevertheless, owing to the complexity of the subject, I appreciate the hard work put in by the tutors and the team at coursera and IBM!Thank you!",0,6,Ashish Pandey,77435468

I think the points need more explanation and it might be more suitable to extend this course to more weeks. Moreover, one has to go through peer review. I really wait for a long time to get reviewed. Moreover, after I put 'my course is going to expire soon', someone just gave all zero to my assignment and I had to reloaded the work again and found new people reviewing it. This is really a terrible experience. ",0,0,Zizhi Wang,90046779
