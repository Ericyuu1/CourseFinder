58961146~COURSE!~bMv1IYE-EeaorQ60KZd96w,1643424428720,1,0,"This is a fascinating subject and I was enthusiastic about learning more. However, the class format is repetitive, awkward, and not engaging. The online course design is of poor quality and the quizzes are not pedagogically sound. I had been planning on pursuing the complete Global Challenges series, but this course, as a representative sample of what GIES has to offer, has turned me away from further pursuing this. I am very disappointed.",0,1,Audra Merfeld-Langston,58961146
81630649~COURSE!~bMv1IYE-EeaorQ60KZd96w,1625168496006,1,0,"This course is disappointing. There are so many issues that I found hard to believe UIUC selected it as part of MBA program course.1. It addresses important topics related to poverty and sustainability that I agree  we and business should care about but the focus is blur. There is no connection with business globalization whatsoever. No content related how business should be conducted at global environment. Course name is misleading. We worked on project for a country and only focus on that country2. Content in article, video and live session are repetitive, literally from week 1 to week 8. 3.  Outdated and inaccurate information.  4. Boring content and presentation. Instructor obviously reads to speak. 5. Live session is disorganized. Instructor failed to clarify questions. He only focused on how to complete projects instead of teaching what we should learn.6. Poor language choice. Hard to follow content in video and article compared to other courses I've taken. Purposely use sophisticated verbiage for simple concept.  Should consider students that do not speak native English. Education is to make complicated theory easy for student to understand and apply to real world problem. Not to complicate simple concepts.",0,4,Dorathy Anderson,81630649
49991423~COURSE!~bMv1IYE-EeaorQ60KZd96w,1591499294031,1,0,"Possibly the worst course I have been involved in in my life. The professor is providing a wooden delivery reading the chapters of his books, which are a prerequisite. Once you have read through them, then the exact same information with identical wording is delivered in the videos. Furthermore, although the course is addressing a very important issue and it would be important as part of a Third World Economics program, I am struggling to see why it is included as part of an MBA.",0,7,Fotios Stavropoulos,49991423
3798250~COURSE!~bMv1IYE-EeaorQ60KZd96w,1562699021984,1,0,The videos are mainly just the professor reading slides. Poor presentation in terms of lack of creativity and the material does not catch the student's attention. The way the material is presented is flat and boring. The evaluations are unnecessarily long and repetitive. ,0,6,Jose Salas ,3798250

I guess a bad adaptation of the live course (you can tell also from the indications to be used to rate peers assignment, not applicable for this version).This is the first one of a specialization I am very interested in learning, so that I will go on hoping the other courses will be better.",0,4,Letizia Pierallini,527852

That said, the class is kind of rambly and unstructured - quizzes are convoluted (and have a lot of typos), and though the class tends to be about concepts, a lot of the quiz questions are oddly specific. Interesting, but there is probably better ways to learn this material.",0,3,Kyle Becker,3800598
