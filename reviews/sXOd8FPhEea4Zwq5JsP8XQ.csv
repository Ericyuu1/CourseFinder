55610551~COURSE!~sXOd8FPhEea4Zwq5JsP8XQ,1590536594528,4,0,"The portion of the course dedicated to ""resolving"" religions differences was a complete waste of time, as it simply does not take into consideration the personal nature of Faith, which cannot be seen,  and therefore does not show evidence.  To suggest that the best way to resolve a religious disagreement is by finding ways to AGREE with people isn't helpful or realistic.  As far as I am concerned, while there may be no way to ""resolve"" a religious disagreement, we can all learn Tolerance and Acceptance.  We can learn that each person's beliefs are important to THEM, if not to us, and agree to disagree.  For those of us who do not believe, let it be Accepted that they have not been affected in a way that those who do believe have been.  That is not wrong, that is just our experience.  And for those who DO believe, the most important thing we can do is pray for tolerance and acceptance of everyone around us who believes differently.  The rest of the course was  both informative and enjoyable.",0,2,Carey DiBernardo,55610551
