Data driven analysts quite often forget about business, so it will help you to focus more on business outcome. But there are multiple problems in this course. *sigh* First one is very low quality of the R code. Looks like instructors never heard about code style, good naming practices and code organisation. Code is written by amateur analyst, all the data sets will be named ""data"" in the same script, code is messy and inaccurate. You teach the people, show them how proffesional code look like in R! Second one -- poor quality of the queezes in the course -- they all require trivial -- you just need to correct the R script to pass. It doesn't bring any addititional value to the material you've just learned.
