These two examples occur several times throughout the course, since hall and porticos are ubiquitous architectural features in the course.

64298279~COURSE!~nT9PuhlmEeePEAqWl-RQQA,1598297157154,5,0,"The continuity of Roman ideology from the early Bronze Age through the end of the empire is well illustrated in this course by concentrating on the Palatine archeological record, where the foundation myths are brought to life by the successive description of buildings and monuments. Place confers legitimacy and  continuity with the origins of Power. The demonstration of Roman obssesion with connecting present legitimacy to the past via location and naming of buildings is a useful insight into the foundational myths of the Paletine. The maps and schemas could be presented in a collection of pdf documents as they are far too detailed to grasp in the quick presentations in the course. More simplified maps (i.e. many fewer archeological details) with clear directional indications (N,S,E,W) would be helpful, as would presenting the maps in the same orientation each time. This would help immensely in the quiz sections. A bibliography from classical literature and more modern archeological sources would be helpful including Aicher's Rome Alive Vol I which gives the main literary sources for Roman archeological sites. Coarelli's Rome and Environs (UC Press, 2007) is a very useful text book to use as well. ",0,0,michael west oborne,64298279
