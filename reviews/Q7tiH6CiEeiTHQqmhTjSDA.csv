37137760~COURSE!~Q7tiH6CiEeiTHQqmhTjSDA,1605273060568,4,0,Generally a good course but not nearly enough time is dedicated to discussing maximum likelihood estimates. It's a complicated subject and giving it only 3x 1 minute lectures creates more confusion than anything else. ,0,1,Justin Healy,37137760
10869800~COURSE!~Q7tiH6CiEeiTHQqmhTjSDA,1602966163735,4,0,"This was a delightfully challenging course with just the right mix of instructional guidance and independent thinking required. My reason for not giving it 5 stars stems mostly from the fact that the wording of the final quiz was at times unnecessarily ambiguous in my opinion.Still, this course really forces the learner to put into practise what they've learnt, as opposed to merely spitting it outback from rote memory.

However, I find the likelihood function part is not clearly explained. I find the instructor is avoiding statistics theory on purpose, while it results in confusion for some concepts.
