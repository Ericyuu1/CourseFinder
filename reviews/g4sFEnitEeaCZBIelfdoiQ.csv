625905~COURSE!~g4sFEnitEeaCZBIelfdoiQ,1615013894374,2,0,"Although the contents and the way Daphne explains the subject are of top quality, the rest of the specialization leaves a deep frustrating feeling. There is no TA present at all during the courses. Since the quizzes and final exams are dubious, sometimes pedants, and written in an extremely confusing fashion, you end up guessing instead of applying what you have learned. The book is essential, not a recommendation, and needs to be carefully read. Moreover, PAs are not clear, sometimes as a chunk of some other larger PA, the code is full of bugs so that sometimes only Matlab (nop, no Python, sorry) works, and sometimes you have to look into the net to see how to correct bugs to be able to submit the code. Again, no TAs, so all fall into the blogs, and forums. This is very, very frustrating. The final exam can be re-taken in intervals of 24 Hs. So if you happen to start three days before the end of the course you may find yourself paying again to just take the final exam. An interval of 4-8 Hs may be sufficient since the lectures are not so long. Since the confusion in the questions of the final exam is huge, almost sure you will have to re-try the exams at least twice. I think the intention was to make the course intensive and difficult, but the way it was chosen, transforms the course into an epic failure. Summary: if you are looking to gather knowledge, stay away from this specialization. There are plenty of free courses with deep explanations, addressing modern techniques, and correct code PAs, under the same limitations: you are alone, no TAs or colleagues to be asked. (e.g., https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/Class/10708-20/lectures.html, by March 2021). If it happens that the specialization is paid by the company you are working for, then go ahead, but keep in mind that you are alone. If it is no, do not waste time and money. I have finished the specialization with honors (almost 100%). Still, I am deeply disappointed. The two stars are given due to Daphne.",0,1,mgbacher,625905

During the course 1/2/3, a lot of times you will find that prof Koller speaks about many details and crucial facts that are not even shown in the ppt!

And also keep in mind that for the final exams, you don't get to see your answer or any hint about your error once you submit, thus quite challenging and sometimes frustrating, but could be rewarding once you pass.Among other things, some lectures have bad audio quality, CC are incomplete, and the discussion forums are not very active.Anyway, if you're about to take the final part of this specialization, good luck!",0,1,Shawn,11599007
