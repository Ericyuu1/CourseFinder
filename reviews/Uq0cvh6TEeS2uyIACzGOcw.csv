Parece increíble que en todo el curso NINGUNO haya  dado ejemplos de lo que es la dichosa Dieta Nórdica, un menú, como se complementan los alimentos, sólo casi al final  un expositor  menciona 
""El NND,  incluye una alta ingesta de alimentos procedentes
de paisajes silvestres, en el mar y en la tierra, y es principalmente orgánico. Por el contrario, el NNR incluye alimentos no locales,especialmente mariscos y productos vegetales procedentes de zonas extranjeras""Eso NO me dice nada me quedo en las mismas, terminé todo el curso y sigo sin saber cuál es la dichosa DIETA NORDICA Creo que este curso no lleva a ninguna parte, no pierdan el tiempo.
