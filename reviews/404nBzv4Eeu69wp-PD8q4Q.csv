7547835~COURSE!~404nBzv4Eeu69wp-PD8q4Q,1624736074059,1,0,"This class has very little content that actually teaches elastic search.  A more appropriate title of this class should be ""A short history of SQL vs NOSQL systems"".  Like another reviewer has said, you can get perfect scores just by cutting an pasting code snippets.  I am very surprised that a very highly rated instructor like Dr. Chuck can feel good about calling this an Elasticsearch class.  There are only 3 actual programming assignments in the class and in my opinion they teach very little about Elasticsearch. ",0,6,Steven Oshry,7547835
35577634~COURSE!~404nBzv4Eeu69wp-PD8q4Q,1620949659886,1,0,"The course is called PostgreSQL for Everybody. I don't think that this is accurate. The first 2 courses are an introduction to PostegreSQL but the later 2 are not. Also, calling them courses is a bit much. It is clear that the 4 courses were actually just 1 course and the weeks belonging to the original course were transformed into a full course (even to the point that the last ""week"" of the las course only has a 2 minute video. Many other ""weeks"" have similar extensions with maybe 10 to 15 minute videos only). The assignments are short, not well thought and do not make you learn. In many cases the assignments are only about copying and running provided scripts.The last 2 ""courses"" are way off topic for a course called PostegreSQL for everybody.

73798048~COURSE!~404nBzv4Eeu69wp-PD8q4Q,1659218107151,4,0,"The course is interesting and capacious. There were 2 things called dificulties. The first - it was hard for me to understand what the code I have to put in the ""answer-field"", like should it be really the code or the response from terminal after command' execution (this option).
And the second - the assigments are written in Python. I am junior developer and use javaScript. I hav never tried  python before, so I spend some time to became familiar with basic things.
Everything  else was  perfect.",0,0,Hanna,73798048
