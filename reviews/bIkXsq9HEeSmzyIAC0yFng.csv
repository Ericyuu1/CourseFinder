6056123~COURSE!~bIkXsq9HEeSmzyIAC0yFng,1509036646468,2,0,"My expectation from the course was huge as many people told me coursera classes are great etc. However I found this course is a huge let down for me. The content was too primitive and generic, more suitable for one with non IT background. The content is not deep and rich. Apart from that, some of the videos are in non-english voice. Atleast those should have an english voice over than having just a sub titles. Some of the videos are mere waste of time and useless. I am not going to recommend this course atleast to any of my colleague. I hope the other courses are better. Some other courses seems interesting, but now I am doubtful to take those.

38756154~COURSE!~bIkXsq9HEeSmzyIAC0yFng,1651733803061,3,0,"The course in general provides high-level view on some key CIO challenges. Could be a good starting point for IT colleagues in their CIO journey. However,  there are two topics that definitely needs to be taken into account by the new learners BEFORE enrolling: - Course is given by  3 instructors: 1 English speaker, 1 French-English speaker (English with full French accent), 1 French-only speaker (no English at all). The text provided to support the course is probably from some automated voice-to-text converters and/or translator web sites: there are full of errors, non-meaningful statements, etc which mean no sense to a reader when he/she can not understand what the instructor said.- Course requires some assessments to be submitted by attendees which need to be reviewed by other course attendants.  This is not a very active course; therefore generally the due time passes before you get sufficient reviews from attendees. Then you need to reset due times again, post in forums begging for user reviews, etc. I understand the idea of community assessment; however, this topic needs to be addressed before sold to new learners.Best",0,0,Alper Yurdakul,38756154

Even for the parts that are spoken in english, the written translation - which seems to be done by a robot - misunderstands many words, some of which are translated into hilarious and just plain wrong english words. I put a lot of effort into the peer review submissions as well as reviews and from what I can see the grading was sometimes done based on only one or two peer reviews. I was of the impression that at least 6 reviews would be needed in order to ensure a good quality peer grading. Also, while I was trying to meet my goal of 6 peer reviews for week Nr. 7, I was presented with submissions from 2016 and 2017 that I had to grade.
