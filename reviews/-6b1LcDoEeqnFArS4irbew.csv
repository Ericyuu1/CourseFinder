I just got a problem finishing the coding because the Rhyme cloud stopped running my codes for an unknown reason. Also, one of the difficulties that I have observed is that the instructor's video lags even if my internet connection was okay. But overall, I enjoyed the session and I find it very practical and informative. Looking forward to joining the next Guided Project. Thank you Dr. Ahmed, Coursera and DOST Caraga.",0,0,Alnie Demoral,62842891
