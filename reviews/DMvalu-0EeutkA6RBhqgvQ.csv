103119039~COURSE!~DMvalu-0EeutkA6RBhqgvQ,1660831524064,4,0,"Pretty strong virtual offering with an engaging instructor. Only criticism is the focus on Elizabeth Holmes in Week 4 exercise. If she is to be focal point, the Theranos reading should be easily accessible - and I question whether it's proper to focus solely on her, given the other examples. I'd like to see her as focus for 1/2 of exercises and maybe another CEO (Enron or other company) for the other 1/2. 

Also, because focus is marketplace-driven decisions, it does not directly apply to USG executive training, but can be stretched there in terms of managing organizational change - it does also offer insight into how companies can fail, and I often deal with executives at companies with whom the USG does business. So looking for traps in vendor corporate cultures is a useful tool.",0,0,Christopher Joyal,103119039
