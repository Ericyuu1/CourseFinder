So far I have rated at least 6 piers and every time I come back to my desk I have yet another assignment to rate a pier. I don't get to do what I want to do and that is write.

59262856~COURSE!~oOoBbJmUEeigcQ6ACV18LA,1598888856126,2,0,"The two stars are for the quality of the instruction. For each of the four parts of this course. The rest of it is truly reprehensible. The focus seems to be on getting people to sign up and pay up. Obviously, for the price one can't expect any feedback from the instructors but peer feedback is a disaster. Most of the people I've had to review or who have reviewed my submissions have enormous difficulty with the English language. Some of them can't write a straight sentence in English. On the site we are asked to make allowances for the fact that English may not be the first language of the students. But this is a writing course—writing in English. People who cannot write in English should not be enrolled in this course. But Coursera seems to care only about taking in the fees. I'm surprised that the instructors—all of them successful, critically acclaimed writers and poets—should sign on to a project where bringing in the money (enrolling people in the thousands) seems to be the priority.",0,3,Rabia Ali,59262856
12054080~COURSE!~oOoBbJmUEeigcQ6ACV18LA,1592918382864,2,0,"The quality of the transcripts is abysmal; every transcript is scattered with errors, including many which alter the fundamental meaning of the sentence. (Don't they proofread??!!) Despite the poor quality, I was motivated to write and I learned something so all is not lost. However, for a paid course, I expect better. It should also be made clear that the only reviews a learner will receive are peer reviews - there is absolutely no tutor/learner interaction. There is also a major issue with having to complete 3 peer reviews when the learner is told repeatedly that there are no reviews available! Very frustrating. Finally, although I enjoyed this course and learned something, Coursera needs to be aware that there are many other excellent sources of online learning and if they want to maintain their reputation (or improve it!) they need to up their game and improve the content quality and accuracy. I did complain about the transcript errors and was told someone would reply to me in 24 hours. That was a month ago so I'm not optimistic that anyone even read the complaint let alone dealt with it.",0,2,Rosslyn Dennis,12054080

- The last assignment did not really reflect what was learned that week.
- Connecting students to writing groups, maybe another online platforms for writers, would be fantastic!",0,0,Mehdi Khadraoui,12297158

Coursera is
a wonderful educational tool and I have, since discovering the site, often
signed up for classes but usually never completed whatever assignments came
attached. I was determined to do so when I signed up for this class. The
instructor was wonderful. Her instructions, her insights and her guest
interviews all made you feel that you were actually in a class, not just
learning at a distance. In addition to learning how to improve my own personal
essay writing I really came away with a greater appreciation for the format and
the genre. I also look forward to reading the works of Amy Bloom and many of
the other writers she mentioned in her talks.- Wilma Jean

Amy Bloom is an inspiring teacher, reaching right into my living room with her clear delivery and that lovely conspiratorial smile that makes me feel a special student. I am a writer by trade but have never tackled memoir. This came to me by chance (fate?) at just the right time in the year my 98-year-old father died and I was catapulted into family ties and family memories by being an executor for his estate. This course enabled me to step to one side a bit as different memories slid in in response to assignment questions and I was able to look at them 'professionally' as I prepared and wrote and revised. I have also been privileged to read and comment on others' wonderful assignments and receive helpful comments on mine from fellow students. Thank you Amy and Wesleyan. ",0,0,Jennifer Levin,27943802

Her passion is catching. Amy Blooms personality and forthcoming ways, makes you as a student, believe that you can do this. That is so wonderful.To Coursera I cannot award anymore than one star and that is just for being here. Since the introduction of the 'Finish at your own pace' concept, it has destroyed any sense of being part of a community. The grading and peer review systems are not working as they should.  The new concept, I am sure, works perfectly well in factbased courses, where two plus two, can only be four. But not in liberal arts.In liberal arts, I see the writing of assignments and the giving and receiving of peer reviews, as a very important and integral part of the course, however, with the 'Finish at your own pace', it has been decapitated.I have been informed by an employee not to expect this to change.
