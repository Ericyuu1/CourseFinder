42356924~COURSE!~B07TSjljEeWYbg7p2_3OHQ,1611293307534,1,0,"Short version: Don't pay the $50 for the specialization because you are unlikely to get feedback. Long version: The content of the four free modules is excellent and well worth going through. The instructors are great and the information is well-presented and easily applicable. I purchased the capstone program because the description stated that we should ""expect feedback"" from the faculty on the work we submitted. Now, I have to say that I should have realized that the likelihood of faculty from a top-ranked business school going through and giving individual feedback on an assignment from an online class with thousands of students was probably nil. However, I chose to believe what was written in the description of the course. It's been over a year since I finished the course and I have gotten no feedback. When I wrote to Coursera to complain, they said ""we cannot enforce the Staff for each course to provide the feedback as it is mentioned in the course information."" Don't waste your money supporting a platform that will knowingly promote something that they know they can't make happen. ",0,1,Hallie Treadway  ,42356924

I submitted my completed work in the middle of November 2016 and have yet to receive any feedback (posting on May 23 2017). Based on the forums, my fellow classmates also have not received feedback. I have contacted Coursera via chat and provided the information for them to evaluate; unfortunately it appears they have little control over the faculty's adherence to the promises made in the course description. I also reached out to one of the professors via that individual's posted email address with the school. It has been a few weeks now and I have not received a reply from the professor either. The promise of having my work evaluated by real university faculty was a major factor in my decision to take this course over other online options. As an alumnus of U of M, I am very disappointed by the lack of follow up to a product on which they have put our Block M. ***Update as of 5/30/2017.  I did end up hearing back on the delay.
