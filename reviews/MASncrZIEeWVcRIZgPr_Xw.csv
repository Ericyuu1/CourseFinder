i have taking 4 courses in the specialty of 3D printing and additive manufacturing and i am disappointed for the first time as you will get stuck waiting for others to review your work and the teaching staff is nowhere to be found!. 
if you are not taking the specialty course i don't recommend you taking the course as the 3D software course cover all the needed information and the project that can be done over there is much useful and informative.
the series of 3D printing and additive manufacturing was wonderful experince and helped me to increase my skills and on my carrier level as well,  ",0,0,Hassan shaker alsinan,65345353

Secondly, I didn't get my specialization badge even though I successfully completed all the 5 courses in the 3D printing specialization.A crucial suggestion: Please include a direct interaction with the course instructor in discussion forums so that learners can clear many doubts which require the assistance of the instructor.
