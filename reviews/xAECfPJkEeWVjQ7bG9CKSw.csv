14092631~COURSE!~xAECfPJkEeWVjQ7bG9CKSw,1540878670192,1,0,"Did not have the patience to get past the first bloc of videos as most of the talk ended up being in Chinese without English subtitles. I thought another reviewer exaggerated a bit, but it is sadly true: this course seems useless for non-Chinese speaker. I think it should probably be labelled as Chinese language.",0,0,Romain Renard,14092631

The lectures are recorded from lectures at university and the rhythm is very slow and not very well explained (at least the first week).

28864741~COURSE!~xAECfPJkEeWVjQ7bG9CKSw,1561489672963,2,0,The title and materials sounded very promising. However this course is not for English speaking student. The lecturer speaks his native language most of the time and only on few occasions in English. As the speaker switches back and forth from his native language to English the sentence does not make sense anymore. If you speak the same language as the lecturer than you would benefit from this course.,0,8,Nataliya Berry,28864741

He wasn't able to explain very fluidly some experiments and was stucking excessively himself while speaking. T​he three stars are because of the excellent explanation and presentation of the second professor, dr. Lee and because of the third teacher who had all the translations in her PowerPoint slides.
