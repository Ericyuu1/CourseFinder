Anybody who paid for these courses should be refunded their money due to the extreme poor quality. I thought this IBM course would be different than the others, but they went right back into the speed through and not explaining the more complex topics again.

In addtion the environment has been undergoing upgrades and changes, and the course materials are not up to date with the changes in the cloud environment.
