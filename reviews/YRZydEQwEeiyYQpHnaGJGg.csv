That gives much better understanding around the subject and even if it takes time and sometimes extra time to google all the vocabulary, it is well worth it. You will learn so much more. I also love how after each new part, there is a small exercise, there is always additional reading aso and then a big end excersise that kinda builds up on the previous weeks.
