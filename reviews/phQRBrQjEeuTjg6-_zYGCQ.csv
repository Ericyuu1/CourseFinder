109223230~COURSE!~phQRBrQjEeuTjg6-_zYGCQ,1671326604334,1,0,"The assignments were unclear (random programming exercises with no comments or indication as to what the components are actually supposed to accomplish) and had little to do with the assigned readings. Didn't feel like a college level course let alone a graduate level course, but it also didn't feel like it would be useful for someone just looking to learn about software architecture for big data.",0,0,George Baker,109223230

The monitors do not monitor the forums at all so if students are not helping others then there is NO help for your questions.3.  They completely rely upon students grading other students (there is no auto-grader e.g. like Univ Calif Sand Diego does).  4.  There is ""make-the tests pass"" grades, but students are able to make one of the tests pass w/o actually doing it the correct way so the tests don't have sufficient efficacy.  (The Milk Problem - a few students just copied the update method logic to the decrementBy logic which should not pass).5.  The course does not allow me to attach the certificate to my LinkedIn profile. Instead it asks me for my government issued ID as if I'm taking the course for college credit (I'm not).",0,0,David Peterson,26758085
