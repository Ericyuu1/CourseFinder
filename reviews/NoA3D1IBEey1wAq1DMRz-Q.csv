4368034~COURSE!~NoA3D1IBEey1wAq1DMRz-Q,1659849978562,1,0,"This course is very confused. It has not decided if it wants to be either a:

1) Introduction to operating systems
2) Introduction to coding C code that interacts with operating systems
3) Introduction to how to code your own operating system.

As such, I cannot really see what I can use the information in this course for. I was looking for a course that explains how operating systems work, and how to make my own operating system - and this course is NOT that. And - I don't really know what else it is.",0,1,Jakob Jenkov,4368034
