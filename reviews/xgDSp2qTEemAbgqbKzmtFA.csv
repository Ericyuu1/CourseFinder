It's outdated. Most of the course matter is still based in 2019, including many of the linked-out articles. That's an eternity in digital marketing.2. The course jumps from highly basic to highly technical in a short period of time (during the section on programmatic, conducted by TradeDesk). Discussions on programmatic, PPC, cookie monitoring etc start among the panelists without explaining what those terms actually are. Again, the panelists are knowledgeable, but the structure fails from a course / education point of view, especially since this was meant to be for basics. The kind of conversations that were being had could confuse an experienced digital marketer (I've spent ~8 years in the digital industry on the creative / strat side of things and wanted to brush up on the AdTech part of things, which is why I took this course - it would have been totally befuddling for newbies).3.
