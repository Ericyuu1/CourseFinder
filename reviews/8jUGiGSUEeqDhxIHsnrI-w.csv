I stopped after the first module (first week) because I checked and the rest of the course follows the same structure. T​he videos are monotonous and the instructor could be easily subtituted by a list of bullet points. He rarely makes any observations and the tests are atrocious quizzes wanting people to remember specific dates from an infinity of dates provided. After teh first week, I felt that I didn't teh information I had hoped to learn. The quality of this course  is really poor and I don't hink this is a good introduction to the topic. A suggestion is for the videos to be a little more dynamic and interactive. Another thing that could be different is teh presence of the instructor in some of the videos. Finally, I would like to suggest you don;t foucs the quizzes into a bunch of dates only scholars would know by heart.",0,6,Rafael Machado Chagas,1619629

Discussion  I didnt seem to get into any discussions in this course - perhaps you could give people 5 marks for posting comments or references?  eg  I would like to have joined a discussion about norse myths in contemporary culture.  And Im sure others could have helped me understand things like kennings 2. More readings I got a lot more from the course when I started to read around the topics of Norse Myth - learnt more (independently) about poetry, runes, trade, archaeology, agriculture, Tacitus,  climate change in Scandanavian pre christian times.  I would have got more from the course if readings had been provided even if not assessed.  For example I was fascinated to read about Snorri as a person and the medieval nobles who must have commissioned collections of myth and would have liked to see a video on his life and times.  3​. I feel I know a great deal more about the  prechristian themes and stories in poetry collected in medieval times - that go towards making up what we now think of as norse mythology.
