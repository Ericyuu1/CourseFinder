Moreover, the course seems very opinionated and ends of the wars seems to be just glossed over into economic terms rather than historic facts.

Quizzes rely too much on rote knowledge and the lecturer's opinion rather than what one should take away from the presentations. Also, coming from India and also having stayed for long in the Middle East, the entire picture given by the lecturer of these regions seem to be quite flawed as the picture is very narrow.

50289213~COURSE!~s4CUmzCqEeWPngoW78wA_Q,1588673297276,3,0,"On the one hand, I really appreciated this course. Prof. Zelikow and his team created an extradionary course and did enormous work. Despite the fact that I studied history at university, I discovered many new facts. What I really liked that there was a lot of information about colonial possessions and government. On the other hand, I was disappointed that the history of America prevailed. This course is called ""The Modern World"" and I would like to know equally about different countries. I still have an impression that the USA is often presented as a ""hero"". I don`t agree with the presentation of the Soviet Union. Being a Russian historian I can say that there are many documents in archives (not only in Russia, but in England for exmple) that may disprove some arguments given in this course. I was a bit shocked and sad when I didn`t hear anything about the the Soviet liberation of Europe and the German Instrument of Surrender between the USSR and Germany. I also can`t agree with the fact that the Soviet Union won the war only thanks to American supplies (land-lease). There is one more fact that I didn`t like: the Soviet famine of 1932-1933 was only in Ukraine. It incuded a lot more territory - Volga region, Kazakhstan, Nothern Caucasus... And I don`t agree that the Soviet Union was responsible almost for everything and made suffer all the Socialist Bloc. I would like to comment the Cuban Missile Crisis also. I totally disagree that it was the Soviet Union`s fault. The crisis actually occured not only because of the Soviet Union but also because America placed its missiles in Turkey in 1961. I hope that one day the Soviet Union won`t be presented only in a negative light and historical studies studies will include more archival documents.",0,5,Uliana Bannikova ,50289213

The best analogy I can think of is Vin Scully. I always loved Vin. When Vin did the Dodger game he spoke to you like he was sitting next to you at the game and just making a few comments. ""You know Eric, Garvey has hit safely in 13 of his last 14 games and he's had an RBI or a run scored in all 13."" I can imagine Phillip Zelikow sitting next to me and saying ""Hey Eric, Have a look at this photo of the 1931 British Indian Round Table conference. Everybody is mugging for the camera, but not Gandhi. He's too cool."" When he tells the story of Gorbachev trying to decide how to handle East Germany in the late 80's he puts his hand on his head like he's Gorbi trying to figure it out. When he briefly mentioned the German death camps he was so disgusted I thought for a minute he was getting ready to spit. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

I really want to thank to the Professor Philip Zelikow for share with us
 his extensive knowledge. History has always been considered boring, and
 that responds, in my opinion, to the way it has been taught in school. 
However, it is impossile to understand our present if we do not know our
 past. I live in Venezuela and the history of each Latin american country is not isolated of the panorama described by the proffesor. Thank you very much!

Given that the course took us to 2013, I wonder if Professor Zelikow and others feel the transition period he noted between the 2nd and 3rd phases is becoming better defined  - or perhaps more blurred.  I do feel we are at a pivot or transition and try to look at the cause of problems and solutions to them. Perhaps we will one day have a course or chapter devoted to the political and economic consequences of the global pandemic when reviewing decisions made by national leaders.

I continue to be impressed with his focus on the history itself and the examination of verifiable things, rather than creating narratives. Also, he is obviously a self-aware historian, as several times he references his teaching style and why he is choosing it, with reasons I find quite justified. The material itself is well-spaced and engaging. Kind of crazy to think that at the start of the course, the first World War hasn't happened yet, and then we end in the present. I think the weeks are well-divided and I certainly learned quite a lot that I hadn't known particularly about WWI and the Cold War. It's not so easy to divide WWI into good and evil, as it so obviously is during WW2. Prof. Zelikow also -- and this is important to me -- was able to subtly respect the incredible pain of these periods with his ""classroom"" style. In those lectures, he was less jovial, and more analytical, though still without adding his own emotional commentary. I very much appreciate this; and I think his style of teaching allowed me the space not only to learn a heck of a lot, but form my own intellectual and emotional conclusions about each period.

Because of him, this course is superb.  Coursera is untrue to its representations about the course, which is unfortunate and I will rate them one star, but I can't allow that to diminish the quality of the Professor or the Course.  Coursera has taken the position that Part Two is completely different from Part One and different rules apply.  I always thought that if you offer something in parts, any disclaimer regarding the parts had to be disclosed prior to someone taking Part 1 and the disclaimer had to apply to all parts.Just be warned that Coursera apparently has taken the position that it can create a totally separate entity and name it as Part 2 and that gives them the right to govern Part 2 differently from the way it governed Part 1.  I know that Coursera has many fine Universities that participate in its online studies programs and that a number of those institutions have  exceptional law schools.  UVA's law school is one of the very best in the country and I would strongly recommend to Coursera that they contact the law professor who teaches consumer law and run this matter by them to find out the potential consequences of what they are doing.  5 Stars to the course, to Professor Zelikow, and to the University of Virginia.
