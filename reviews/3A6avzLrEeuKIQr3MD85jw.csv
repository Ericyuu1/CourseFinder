118691790~COURSE!~3A6avzLrEeuKIQr3MD85jw,1674060724493,1,0,I am new to this industry and picking up stuff. Thanks for the efforts from the team. But I was hoping for a more engaging and quality content on intermittency issue and how to integrate with the grid. The quizzes are not great as it does not test your understanding in a positive way. I hope the instructors would revise this course to suit the new scheme of things in 2023 and beyond.,0,0,Krishnan Thrissur Sivan,118691790
