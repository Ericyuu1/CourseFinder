62358540~COURSE!~EuY3FGpwEeqB5xLGfM8Amw,1590884345047,1,0,The program that's used for teaching this class doesn't seem compatible with all devices; including my device. I can only see about a 1/4 of the video. I went to the help center but everything talks around the subject and doesn't give a solution. For some reason the unenroll button isn't appearing for this class. The help center has noway of asking a question. I realize these are technical problems and not a problem with the actual class. However the fact that I can't participate in the class due to device differences is very frustrating.   ,0,0,Shelley Stempeck,62358540
