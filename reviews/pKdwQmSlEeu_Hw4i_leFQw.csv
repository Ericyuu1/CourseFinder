120783434~COURSE!~pKdwQmSlEeu_Hw4i_leFQw,1675429864874,3,0,"I learned a lot but this course was okay but it is in need of major updating for example : 1) yum is still supported but has been replaced with DNF 2) when adding users and groups you need to have sudo or elevated privileges  to the system 3) Fedora needs to mentioned as it is  part of the developmental Red Hat release  the release cycle goes as follows Fedora -> Centos stream -> Red hat Enterprise Linux 4) As I mentioned in the last course, Which I gave a much better rating to,  would be more beneficial for a student to either use a virtual  box or have a laptop with a Linux distribution on it  (I am currently usingt Linux mint 21) 5) I did love the review notes and slides at the end those were very helpful and helped  enhance the learning process . Do not get me wrong, I did learn a lot in the course and love the quizzes but the course needs to be updated I will be taking a week off and then moving on to the third course in the series ",0,0,Randy Dickinson,120783434

I'd like to see more of a deep dive in the labs like for curl trying to figure out how to download a web page running ssl.  Also to try installing a package using apt-get or yum...then trying to update or uninstall it.  ,0,0,Michael Mione,118062769
