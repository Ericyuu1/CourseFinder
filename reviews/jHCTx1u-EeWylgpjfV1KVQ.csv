I don't mean to insult anyone or criticize the method of teaching and I am not doubting the credentials of instructors. It is just what I experienced from this course that I am saying. However, I don't mean to discourage anyone from attempting this course. This review is just a summary of what I felt about the first two weeks of this course.]I don't think this course is for the beginners at all. The teaching method did not quite please me. It appears that the instructors and TAs are simply reading the transcripts and bombarding equations on the screen. Also, the course hasn't made any reading material available, and they are not even providing the slides for the lectures (as of till DEC 2016). I have enrolled and completed a course on mobile robotics from Georgia Tech on Coursera and they were using slides and at the same time the instructors were scribbling equations on the slides and ensuring that they maintain synchronicity with the learning and showing them how a particular equation emerges. They also had lectures which were designed to help learners attempt the quiz and special section about MATLAB and how to build robots. They also provided slides to revise what was mentioned in the lectures. They were teaching and not reading from teleprompter. This course looked lot of theoretical and I am not sure for whom it is designed for. Also, in the discussion forum, I haven't received answer to the questions that I'm posting(since right now it's holiday season, I can exempt them from not replying). I knew I could carry on with this irritation and still get the course certificate for which I've paid for, but then there is no point in wasting time in which the explanation is not clear. It would take me almost 20 to 30 minutes to make notes over a 5 minute long video. I would rather read a book on this subject.I would have appreciated if they followed certain steps:1) Make some course material which will help students read and revise information.2) Suggest some reading/reference material to understand the concepts which are not otherwise covered in this course.3) Use pointers(touch screen devices) to show and point out which equations are being referred to and maintain synchronicity between the information given in the slides and the one said by the instructor.4) Supplementary lectures are extremely fast paced and please don't take derivation of an equation for granted and please do explain.So, if you are looking forward to do this course, I suggest you go forward if you have an in-depth knowledge about vectors, matrices and calculus.

Criticisms include: (i)  The course isn't self contained. Physical concepts like 'resultant moment', 'inertial and body-fixed frame' and 'torque' are used without definition. Mechanics is not listed as a prerequisite but it should be.(ii)  Lectures are very mathematical but proofs, intuition and good problem sets are all missing. Listening to a math lecture without doing challenging problems or deriving mathematical results to build intuition can be a waste of time. Check out John Cochrane's Asset Pricing 1 and 2 or Tim Roughgarden's Algo 1 and 2 for great examples of thoughtful problem sets and intuitive derivations. (iii) Way too much powerpoint!  Speed reading a static powerpoint slide overloaded with dense mathematical formulas without using pointers or animations to focus the students attention is a recipe for confusion and frustration. I find hand written derivations, even when the handwriting is a little sloppy, much easier to follow than a static page of formulas plus a sound track. Hand written derivations impose a natural pace and focal point to the content. Check out Gilbert Strang's Linear Algebra, Sebastian Thrun's Artificial Intelligence for Robotics and Andrew Ng's Machine Learning for examples of good derivations of mathematically sophisticated material.(iv) The programming assignments while fun were somewhat ad hoc and disconnected from the lecture material, specifically, the main task of every single assignment was to hand tune a pd controller. No systematic approach was ever described for performing this task. ",0,38,Zachary Harl,70351

The course also points to some resources in order to extend your study on UAVs. However, there are some issues concerning the assignments which I didn't like at all:1. Big gap in difficulty between assignments of first three weeks compared with the assignment of the fourth week.2. The difficulty of the assignments of the first three weeks just relied on sweeping (somewhat 'smartly') a 1,2,3, or 6 dimensional parametric space. I guess that real UAVs engineers are not paid for this. In some assignment, I had to edited a file which I was not supposed to edit in order to pass it.3. The last assignment was quite frustrating for the following reasons  3a. Really long running times to test if the parameters work fine. I would sacrifice the fancy real-time visualization to save some time. Apart from long running times, I guess that UAVs are not solving ODEs in real time on board, so I think is more interesting a more practical/real-time approach.  3b. Search in a 12-dimensional parametric space (some parameters are equal, but still you end up tunning 5,6 independent parameters, which influence each other). Come on, is this useful? I am sure that UAVs engineers don't spend their hours in this kind of crappy search. You could explain at least some existing heuristics when having so many control parameters to tune.  3c.

The course material is interesting and moves at a robust pace and I do think they have made an effort despite the fact that much of it appears lifted from one PhD student's dissertation.   Realistically I would not recommend this course if you don't have a STEM Bachelor's degree and you will likely find it painful if you have been away from your degree more than three years.   None of this is bad, although the material would have benefitted by being spread out by perhaps two more weeks as    realistically people who have been in the workplace a long time may need more time, and have less time per week with family commitments.   Unfortunately there are a number of areas that need work:1 - Inconsistencies and errors in the material.   Certain unexplained suffixes in equations and worse, changes in the suffixes without indication that they changed or what they are.   I don't feel that this was particularly widespread but it did result in some loss of confidence in the course and time being wasted ""interpreting""2 - Tests throughout the course that often provide the relatively limited feedback of ""correct well done"" or worse I'm sorry to say, the relatively useless feedback ""sorry that is not correct"", without ANY explanation of why it was correct or more importantly what an incorrect answer should have been and why.  I can understand that this will hopefully drive students should do more research, but if they hit a wall, realistically they're going to keep iterating on the answers until you pass and learn nothing because of the time pressure to complete by the end of the week.   I wonder if there is a better mechanism that can be used here3 - TA Support - The lack of TA support coupled with some concern about a history of errors led the students to believe that there was an error in week 3.   For 10 days students went back and forth debating which one of the two equations that were supposedly doing the same thing but with missing terms were correct.   NOT ONCE did a TA wake up and step in.   In the end one of the students flagged the video as ""inappropriate"" to wake the UPenn organization up.   The TA then stepped in and said (I paraphrase) ""oh, we just dropped those terms because they're not so important, but we didn't mention that...""  If you are not going to adequately support the students, the material had better be bullet-proof and show some linear thinking4 - The last exam.   Keep in mind if you do this course, you had better be comfortable with calculus, linear algebra, vector math/mechanics and it would be helpful to have a head start in Matlab.   That said, the last question in the last exam, was an order of magnitude more challenging than everything else set and almost felt like a ""shake out"" question.   I passed the course and had a good understanding of the material, but I suspect that the folks that did, made it through that last question in multiple random fashions.   The material itself is relatively academic and the trajectory topic was definitely so.  Unfortunately the one example (jerk trajectory) provided  appears to have left a lot of students feeling very unsupported based on feedback I saw, and would probably benefit from having an example more fully worked through.  As for the final exam, it would be highly desirable for UPenn to provide insight into how they would have solved the last part of the last question as my concern is that there is a whole contingent of people who did this course who didn't come away with as good a grounding on trajectories as they may believe they have",0,0,John Tompkins,7362486

The course content is exciting and there are a lot of instructional concepts. However, I was not satisfied with the way the content was presented. Being used to the chalk and talk environment, and following online videos where the tutor writes the equations on the screen as they go through them, the "" PPT slides and voiceover"" method did not attract my attention. But the content of the course kept me going. I found some of the qualitative quiz questions quite difficult as they were not taught in the class explicitly.Understanding quadrotors, I see that there could not be much done when it comes to programming tasks. Programming tasks Weeks 2 and 3 were extremely easy to code, but tuning the PD gain parameters was the most infuriating task. Even when I got the correct code for Week 3, I was doubting whether I made any mistakes in the code for a long time while the issue was caused by a bad PD gain ratio. The tuning part could be removed by providing a considerable range of possible values of the gains. This would save a lot of wasted time. That being said, I found the final task to be insanely interesting and the satisfaction of solving the final task was extraordinary. I would also appreciate the work done in creating the simulation model and the way the quadcopter was visualized and the trajectory was plotted.Overall, this course pretty much teaches you all the basic theory you need to know to control a quadrotor. If you dont mind wasting a few hours tuning 6-8 values, you would walk out of this course with great satisfaction.PS: There are a few videos of quadrotors doing insane stunts both as a swarm and individually inside the course.

I think this course does require some background engineering knowledge. The last assignment was particularly challenging and really enjoyed. However, I have the following recommendations: 1) the time required for the assignments should be increased to realistic values. Although I found the provided PDFs (in addition to the lectures) useful, it still took time to derive the matrix equation for the snap-trajectory coefficients based on the boundary conditions. Unless the equations are provided in some form, I would suggest a minimum of 9 hours for that assignment. 2) all assignments entail some tuning of coefficients for PD controllers. It can be very confusing to obtain those values, especially if you are not sure what you have done is right and what sort of values to look at. For this reason, I recommend to add an extra step per assignment where the controller is run for a fixed point. That way it is clear from the marker if the equations are correct. Then, a document should be provided on sound strategies for obtaining the coefficients, without a need to look at the blogs all the time.",0,0,Enrico Anderlini,11677749

The Matlab files available for the course work as intended, what is not so obvious though is how they are intended to work, that is because there is very little documentation about them, it would be great if there was more documentation available, especially for people who have never used such tools before.Finally, even though I personally enjoyed this course and I think it had an achievable level of challenge for me, I would definitely not recommend this course for total beginners, or people who do not have followed a math, physics or engineering degrees.

I was quiet pleased with video lectures and with explanations from professors that helped me understand the main topics of the course. Another reason for appreciating this course is that my diploma thesis in mechanical engineering focuses on control of quadcopter with strongly non-linear characteristics. So it provides control strategy that is essential for simulation in real time.

Then finally you need to put all these together in the programming assignments. The assignment from Week 4 is extremely challenging. After figuring out how to work out the equations and translate them into MATLAB codes, you can actually get the quadrotor to dance in the simulation environment, which could give you the sort of feeling that you can do this for real.The course instructor also introduces the work of their research team.
