Unfortunately the course was not designed for a broad audience: only students from universities that have access to databases with paywall can complete the course.

For this reason, peer reviewing a row of very bad quality assignments does not contribute to the learning experience. Some learners submit empty assignments to have access to the peer reviewed assignments that they can copy later for the resubmission.

Nonetheless many things are not explicit in the information about this course, such as the primary guide text is not available with the course price but it has to be bought, some of the most essential databases you see as examples are costly ones and not necessarily the University, Library or Research Institute where you can be working or studying will be available. You will listen A LOT the following words from the head professor ""I TRUST YOUR HOME UNIVERSITY WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH ACCESS"".

I ordered the book online at the beginning of the course and got it only now, on the last day of the course - I had no use of it. Secondly they use paid databases such as derwent and scifinder for which they do not provide access. Since I did not have access to these databases I had to work around other databases explore options in free databases to do assignments.
