25460740~COURSE!~8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,1506201467664,1,0,"The information is out of order for people very new to Java, which makes it difficult to learn with the class. You'll spend a lot of time doing outside research and trying to find examples of code that the instructors fail to present in the lectures. The assignments are rather hard for the scope of what this class is trying to accomplish. For example, this relies a lot on math--which, while useful to programming, isn't necessary to learn the language in the first place. The instructors aren't very helpful with explaining things you don't understand because of ""Coursera's honor code"". This makes the learning process both difficult and aggravating. And the reward of possibly figuring it out is not worth the hours you'll spend trying to work it out.The assignments also contain problems that was not properly gone over within the lectures. So, if you don't have a lot of time to devote to researching the topics yourself, I suggest you skip this one. The forums are so-so in terms of helping you understand things. The instructors and mentors tend to just repeat directions at you instead of listing another example or further explaining how to figure out a problem that they never properly explained in the first place. There is also a final peer-graded assignment for a beginner's class, which must be reviewed by so many people to even be considered as ""complete."" Plenty of people have complained about having to switch to the next course because they can't get enough reviews on their assignment. You must also review 5 assignments, or 10% of your grade is penalized. This is definitely not a class for people looking to learn in their spare time. The amount of estimated time per week is also grossly understated due to the very vague explanations and difficult quizzes and assignments. So, again, don't take this if you don't have a lot of spare time to devote to it.I very, very, very rarely ever rate anything below a 3/5 on websites because it's usually just a matter of not liking the course. But I feel compelled to echo what many others who have not completed the course are saying in the hopes that this course will be revised to be made learnable and passable. I wish I had trusted the negative reviews before wasting my time on this. I'm usually excited to learn things. But I absolutely hate this course.

They say all you need to have is very basic computer knowledge (sending emails, opening a browser), but the lectures are taught using acronyms and terms that are not at the beginner level.  Even the basic concepts are explained using advanced terms or examples that contain code far beyond a beginners level.They also do not really spend any time going over the programming basics.  They discuss them a bit, but they never really give you a bigger picture or really how all the concepts you've learned fit together.   There is no real consistency throughout the course, it just seems like they are throwing random concepts at you and hoping you understand. Then they throw you an assignment that requires you to do rather complicated coding (for a true beginner) without any other form of practice before hand.The assignments are also a bit of a mess.  All you are really doing is 'filling in the blank'.  They give you all this code that has already been written without actually tell you how do to that yourself or what a vast majority of it does and you have to fill in code in a couple places to make it work.  But since everything else is written, you can not run the code as you write it to check your work.  It will fail because the code is looking for things you haven't written yet.  You must write the entire assignment before you can see if the first line of code you wrote works.  I find this to be a very poor teaching method.  You should be able to check your work as you go, or experiment with different ways of writing things.  Instead you are forced to write exactly what they expect.",0,1,Christine Black,17172483
17629929~COURSE!~8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,1474163549118,1,0,"As other reviewers have noted, this course is NOT for beginning programmers! (Unless maybe you are a mathematical genius with total recall.) I have a little background in programming, HTML and CSS, but I found this course to be an absolute nightmare.  It would be interesting to find out if any of the rave reviews came from real beginners. Most of the problems have already been noted by other reviews, so I will only mention a few that I did not see mentioned. The course requirements should include hardware and software essentials.  In particular, the student has no choice but to use Android Studio. If their system is not running a 64bit OS at 2.4 GHz with at least 8 GB of RAM, it can literally take DAYS for Studio to complete the build so that the student can do anything with assignment code. There is a desperate need for a glossary.  The course dives in with more acronyms than the military, and assumes the attmpting learner already has a handle on APIs, SDKs, etc., not to mention many other technical terms (interfaces, ...).  If I asked the average programmer to evaluate the MT based on comparisons with the Complutensian Polyglot and Codex Alexandricus, the effect would probably be about the same. Another glaring omission for beginners is a battery of exercises for each concept/skill. As for ""We've organized all these topics into units that represent roughly 4-6 hours of work each,"" that is absurd! If you multiplied that by 10, it would still be a stretch. I have no doubt about the programming and technical competence of the instructors (though there are some errors in a number of the instructions).  And I'm sure they are very nice people who really want others to learn.  The root problem seems to be what professional communicators call ""The Curse of Knowledge"" -- a syndrome in which a person is so familiar with their subject that they cannot begin to imagine what it is like for someone who is not. My recommendation to a beginner is to look somewhere else.  Take a good introductory course in Java before diving into the vastly more complex world of the Android environment.  I am not qualified to evaluate the course from the perspective of an experienced programmer, but I have noted that they are frustrated by clutter caused by token attempts to make this a beginner course. My recommendation to the faculty is to completely re-engineer this whole specialization.  They should have a separate set of courses truly designed for beginners, and they should get help from qualified instructional designers who specialize in online adult education.  (Might not be a bad idea to get the VU English department to review the lecture text as well.) My recommendation to anyone is to never believe anything Coursera tells you about a course.  Audit the course BEFORE you pay any money!  This is especially important if the course has not actually started.  This course started two months late, and I could not get a refund before the course even got under way! After taking nearly 6 months to wade through a little over half the course requirements, I decided to look at the rest of the assignments and project.  This removed all doubt that to continue was a hopeless waste of time.  So, I decided to end the nightmare, and I'm glad it's over!",0,1,David Noel Washburn,17629929

63295999~COURSE!~8UQBnm04EeWyAQ6K5KeLkw,1593995704700,2,0,"Firstly I would say that this course is informative when it comes to the basics of java. The videos are informative but there is a lack of consistency with what you learn in the videos to actually writing java code. It is very similar to a college course where the pace is quite fast for people who have little to no experience programming. This often leaves students frustrated and discouraged and eventually leads them to give up. There could definitely be more practice added each new lesson of material you learn. Watching someone program and programming yourself are entirely different things. Everything you see on the quiz and programming assignments should be heavily practiced and discussed before they are even attempted. Forums offer some guidance but if you are stuck with how to solve a problem you are better off doing your own research as the moderators will often not give you reasons why your code or quiz answers are resulting as incorrect. If the service was free I would understand but this course is 50 dollars a month. As someone who is interested in becoming a programmer (with little experience) for both personal and financial benefits I think this course could do way better at teaching the material in a way that is practical and applicable. I am also saying this as someone who looks at the world and sees a high demand for programmers, software developers, website developers, game programmers and data scientists while many of these jobs are left unfilled because not enough people have these skills.",0,0,Alistair Shaw,63295999

I feel the course, was very painstaking in terms of code reviewing other people's work.If I were to break up the time I spent doing the course work, it would be as follows:30 % useful work70 % taking care of course logistics (code review, writing comments on every line of code just so that people being asked to review my work are happy). Why do we have to do so many code reviews? Not every assignment requires people's coding style to be evaluated. It places an unnecessary time burden on people who are taking this course not as full time student. Its also reducing the total amount of knowledge that is being disseminated. We should be learning about Android for 4 more hours rather than reviewing code for other people for 4 more hours.The thing I found most frustrating is that the assignments are trying to force a particular coding style on everyone. Since I am an experienced programmer, I understand the importance of coding style, creating functions and all that. However, how I structure my code and how many comments I write are entirely my choice.Now, while I understand that the course material itself does not ask you to structure code one way or another; the review guidelines that are being given to some very inexperienced programmers, makes them believe that this is the only way things should be done.

The fact we get no feedback on incorrect answers is not very helpful. There are only 3 quizzes where I missed just one question but no matter what, I can't get them correct. It would be helpful if there was some explanation why an answer your selected was wrong, a hint or something. Also while some of the quiz answers are obvious from watching the lessons, some are totally not and if someone doesn't have ANY programming experience I think they would find some questions almost impossible to answer. I have a programming background and out of all the quizzes I just missed 1 question on 3 of them, but I've been trying to answer them again, and again, and again and I just can't get them right. If there was feedback after taking a quiz I'm sure it would of helped. For those 3 quizzes, I took them so many times all the other answers are memorized and I just keep trying to get that one right. It's not helpful and then it turns into a ""just keep selecting different things until it's right"" thing instead of understanding it.2. The course says it's for beginners to programming but I beg to differ. I think the way the material is presented and how the assignments are laid out I do not think someone(or not many people) would have gotten through that Week two ascii assignment. I thought they assignments in some cases were harder than the lessons. Maybe it's because they way they were explained in the lessons which brings me to #33. I do not think the instructors use the best/most clear examples to present the material to students. There are many easier examples to teach about looping than showing an Ascii art example. Because not only does the student have to grasp the concept of loops, then also have to think about ascii print logic. I think to someone with no experience would get pretty lost pretty quickly in this course. Some of the things explained in the lessons I would actually look up other videos of other people explaining it to get a clearer picture.4. Some material is not consistent. Like in some assignments the text is wrong, for the Account code example, you never really mention the mOut or the interface the class uses which are in the example files and what to do with them when you write the other constructors (The course goes over this later when talking about the constructors and calling a constructor from another constructor but not that early on when you're working with the Account example files5. It seems this course really isn't fully developed yet and is still going through it's growing painsOverall, I would say there are many other courses that are far better at teaching the basics of Java. For me, since I do have some Java experience and a programming background it wasn't too bad, But I'm thinking of the guy who has never touched a line of code before. I just don't think the course does a good enough job at explaining things to someone like that.I really hope the next courses in the specialization are better organized than this because starting with the next course because the next ones are more important to me than this course was only because of my prior background",0,0,Patrick Hill,4643911

Overall, it was a good course for the cost, and it is certainly achievable by individuals with little-to-no background in Java programming.  Few comments:*The instructors are very helpful and respond quickly to help requests in the forum.  I cannot stress this enough to new/prospective students - if you have an issue, consult the forum! *Some parts of the course are outdated and could benefit from minor updates.  To students, my advice is to consult the Discussion forum and submit a thread, if an answer cannot be found.  Again, the professors are very good about replying quickly.  To the organizers of this course, it would be beneficial to add a note to the lessons with critical new information - Such as using an ABI that is compatible with modern systems.  The ""armeabi"" ABI we are instructed to use in the video isn't compatible with all systems, and this isn't mentioned due to the outdated natured of the lesson content.*I understand the need for peer review, but it was not very helpful for me.  My peer reviews on the final project went one of two ways:  All top scores were selected with no/unhelpful comments, or the peers grading was very unfair (gave 0 points for no reason or counted off for something that wasn't actually an issue).  Hopefully others had a better experience, but based on my experience, most peers view this as a chore and breeze through it, or they use it as an opportunity to be harsh/mean.  I like the auto-grading, because it forces you to look at your code in detail and debug. ",0,5,Lori,66527325

The content is rich and easily understandable. Commitment in taking this course results in building a solid foundation in Java. I have learnt a lot during this course although it's not the first Java course I take. I recommend this course to beginners. It may look a bit overwhelming in the beginning, but a little dedication and patience will help you get through successfully.

I think course is well structured (except for a few minor drawbacks), quizzes fit to the material. An assignments truly buck up the material. And I think material give a grounding in future Android Development.But I think it can be problem with the learning process, mostly with programming assignment. I think it's common that when course come out for the first time it's almost inevitably that there are some issues with autograder. It' s just common. But these issue are usually easy to spot, because the output of autograder contains test cases. So one can easily find out what the problem is, if it's with autograder. As for this course, the autograder output is very minimalistic, and if the problem is with autograder it's rather hard to spot. I myself spent entire evening, trying to find what is wrong with my code, and it was pure luck that I finely spotted the problem (and, yes, it was autograder issue). Such thing could be very frustrating, really.  Another problem with programming assignments is about Peer Review.  The students actually get access to assessment  criteria, after they have submitted they code. And their code not necessary fit these criteria. I think it could spoil the learning process as well.I actually aware that these drawbacks can be corrected in release course, and if they will be, I will be glad to change the rating.",0,0,Antonina Gerasiova,9728860
