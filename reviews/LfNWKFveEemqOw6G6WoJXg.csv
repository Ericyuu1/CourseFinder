46481853~COURSE!~LfNWKFveEemqOw6G6WoJXg,1599403319166,3,0,"A way to improve is to have the course materials not all over the place. For example, compile everything related to modelling (both via app and codes) in ONE place (in one week). That way, it is easier to follow. Also, each speaker seems to use different codes (although it has same outcomes). All speakers can prepare the codes in the same way (same coding) so that students do not get confused. Overall, my experience with the course is good.",0,1,Ezra Sebastian,46481853
