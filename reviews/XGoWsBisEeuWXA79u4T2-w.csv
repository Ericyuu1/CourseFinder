43893550~COURSE!~XGoWsBisEeuWXA79u4T2-w,1609167333855,5,0,Abby Saey's courses are some of the best Project Courses I have come across in Coursera. Her explanations are easy to follow and she covers all important tricks and tips. This course teaches us how to create and customise a Performance Review Course for our Employees using the Eduflow Platform. I highly recommend this course and other courses by Abby Saey. All the Best!!!,0,0,Bensen Alex,43893550
