I will outline some of the issues below.- asks questions about concepts it hasn't taught you and expects you to figure them out by reading between the lines THEN proceeds to cover these topics in depth videos after it already forced you to learn them on your own.  seems counter intuitive and a bit boring towards the end when youre covering things you already figured out last week. - it is clearly written by multiple people who all have different coding styles which creates problems when they change from snake_case to camelCase to alllowercase in the same quiz and its unclear which to adhere to and simply not typing it exactly as the current one causes you to miss questions on assignments. - there is clear typos, grammatical and spelling errors throughout the course which does not make it looks as professional as it claims to be.

Another thing is that while they dive into the database structure, they really do not discuss different database tools (Azure Data Studio, dbeaver, etc...).  Overall, this is a solid course for introduction to databases and SQL.

✅ Pros:
- Summarizes pretty good all the concepts and skills you need to get started with Relational Databases and SQL.
- Provides enough information and Labs to learn what you need to conceptualize, design, and maintain Relational Databases.
- After this course, you should be able to implement a fully functional database for a project.

❌ Cons:
- I would've loved to have more Labs, since I enjoyed a lot working on the ones that are included.
- This course would be more valuable if you were taught how to deploy a Relational Database in the cloud, or in your own server (this might be covered in a later course so this might not really be a con).",0,1,Tadeo Bustamante,44400120
