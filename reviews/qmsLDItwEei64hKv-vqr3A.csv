1427998~COURSE!~qmsLDItwEei64hKv-vqr3A,1661384273037,1,0,"Dear fellow UX designers - it's not the specialization you are looking for, it's too basic, and it won't teach you anything in embedded nor programming and you won't understand what these videos are about (however there are peer graded assignments so you theoretically can learn on your own - then what's the reason of taking this course?). The whole specialization is a simple overview of UX design process for 1st year engineering students who never heard about design at all.I've had high expectations because if you read my review you probably know it's difficult to find materials about UX in embedded so such course could be valueable but this is not! I took it because I've read that it could teach me using QT  with Raspberry Pi and hoped it will extend my existing hardware design knowledge. It offended me because I teach interaction design at industrial design faculty, from my point of view it's ridiculous that it's offered as a part of master degree which costs 20k USD in total. Seriously? That's a level after which you obtain a master degree? Thanks to Coursera Plus subscripton I have it almost for free. Can't blame the lecturer and how he presents the content, he looks knowledgeable. I understand it's supplementary to other courses as part of Msc degree in electrical engineering (not in design or programming) but only as that, not as standalone specialization.",0,0,Ernest Warzocha,1427998

It if for the lack of support/response that I would not recommend the course.T​here wasn't enough students registered in the course. It took over three weeks just to get one assignment reviewed. The support staff just told me that I needed to wait. In the end, I accepted that the support staff could waive the peer review for the final assignment. I needed to accept the minimum grade of 80%. All of this so I could get a certificate where I had completed the work over two weeks earlier. The Coursera support staff said that the alternative was for me to post a request in the forum asking for someone to grade my assignment and if after 10 days, no one did the grading, they would approve the assignment with a minumum score.I​ am still waiting after three weeks for the course monitors/university staff to respond to my two questions. At this time, I could not review the response since I completed the course. ",0,1,Thomas Schott,47606588

The organisation and compact format of his discussions and pointed assignments definitely helped me build some skills and reflect on many past projects.  The human factors of technology is very important and the human interaction / communication throughout design and development within teams is essential. Great building blocks and framework to apply to industry. ,0,0,Kenneth Bazzett,77235394
