The first week gives a very nice overview of the topic from a global perspective, including the causes of GBV. The next two weeks are then very focused on front-line health care workers, particularly in a clinic setting. I felt overall that I would have liked more discussion on health care policy, and community-based responses to preventing GBV (and the role of the health sector). I also felt that the video/audio quality was sometimes very low in some videos, and in general the course could benefit from being updated/refreshed as it is over 5 years old now.",0,0,Brendon Goodmurphy,28006494

However, the fact that the videos only show the presentation slides makes it hard to keep concentration up for the whole time.
