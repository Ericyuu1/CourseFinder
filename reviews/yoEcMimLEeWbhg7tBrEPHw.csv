than 2 weeks without any efforts. It would be better, if during this
course there will be some practical exercises, for example some calculation
methods for simple situations, with explanations and assessment.Also, there is a BIG mistake, that
there is still no video for the first weeks test. As I understand (in
accordance with the course forum), the video is unavailable more than 1
month. I contacted with ""coursera support"", they told me that they
will resolve this problem, but at the end of 1 week the video was unavailable.

positive - I paid my money for this course, and it is impossible to pass
it - no first week test))) Looks like SWINDLE.",0,0,Ernest Merkulov,12956969
