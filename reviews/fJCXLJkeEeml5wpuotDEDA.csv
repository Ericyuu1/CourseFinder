It was not clear to me if the same model was being re-trained and improved upon in 50 trials - or if the idea was to do 50 trials to capture just how good a model it is, using different splits of the data.  Since we were asked to find the mean and sigma of 50 trials - I assumed those trials would be independent and each one performed with a fresh model - otherwise it is odd to find a mean and sigma of a system that is converging to a final result.  In that case it's only the final mean and sigma of the final trial that matters.  So I think some clarity would help there - without giving it all away with regard to how to do the project.",0,0,Frank Suits,92846185
