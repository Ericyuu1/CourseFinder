80325869~COURSE!~h6PSFMlIEeqN_xLRZVexBQ,1614013187850,2,0,"I'm rather disappointed with this course. I subtract one star because the app was too easy and didn't show much functionality. At the same time, there was not enough explanation about the visualization part (I did not work with Seaborn previously) so for me, it was just typing presented code. While most parts of this project had not enough explanation I see no point in having an entire video about creating the requirements.txt  file, especially because it was done with mistakes and instead should be summarized with one command `pip freeze > requirements.txt`. Finally, the Rhyme platform was not working, but it would be a problem if I could download the data used for this application. I couldn't and I didn't have such problems with other guided projects.
