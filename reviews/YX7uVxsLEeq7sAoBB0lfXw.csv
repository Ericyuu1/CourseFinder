7536955~COURSE!~YX7uVxsLEeq7sAoBB0lfXw,1635571541915,2,0,"Whilst the content of this course is well structured, what let this course down is the dismal quality of support provided by the Qwiklabs support team.Many Coursera students undertaking this course were adversely impacted by a technical issue with the lab exercise titled Predict Bike Trip Duration with a Regression Model in BQML. Upon raising a support case to the Qwiklabs support team, it was confirmed that this was a known issue. In spite of that confirmation, no notification was provided to all impacted students to inform them of this and instead, support was poorly handled on a case by case basis.Impacted students were not provided with any clear, consistent, and detailed messaging by the Qwiklabs support team (e.g. what the issue is, who is taking care of it, when it may be resolved, when another progress update may be available, what is the workaround in the meantime, etc). In addition, aside from an initial response upon raising a support case via email with the Qwiklabs support team, no further responses were provided from them in spite of impacted students following up to request progress updates. There was basically a period of >10 days of radio silence from the Qwiklabs support team.This is an incredibly disappointing experience and degrades not only the quality of an otherwise great course but also negatively impacts the experience of using the Coursera platform. It is a pity that the instructors of this course who have clearly put in a lot of effort into content creation have been let down by the Qwiklabs support team.",0,0,Verda Aly,7536955

After this course, I am comfortable at least using AI Notebooks combined with BigQuery. I think I’ll choose Kubeflow as a Service instead of creating a Kubernetes cluster then install Kubeflow. That part and relevant Lab was confusing for me, though this is nothing to do with Google Instructors or Qwiklabs. Basically, Kubeflow, Kubernetes are complex for me still.
