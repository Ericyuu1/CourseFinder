37219153~COURSE!~UJ9ZVUagEeWg8Q7YVWmVfw,1598178383884,1,0,The basic problem here was not the content - which was fine - but the ability to go back . I skipped the whole question about improving the property price predictions (because I didn't see it was a video and pressed Got It! too soon). There was no go-back button to re-review it.  I then had to do the whole capstone without knowing (but guessing) the question I was trying to answer - kinda difficult!!!  ,0,0,Tom Day,37219153

I managed to complete the entire specialization within the 7 days trial period and as a result paid not a single dime for it.
