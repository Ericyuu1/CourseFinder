76639849~COURSE!~HIWhL1UPEeiYKRJKvk-prg,1610575692633,2,0,"I had a problem with running the logistic regression in R since the missing observations that R gave me was not the same as given in this course. Therefore, due to missing observations in R not being the same as the missing values stated in these modules, I had a hard time answering some of the quiz, particularly Week 3.  I requested for help but I did not get a response, I eventually solved the problem but going into Excel and cleaning up my data.",0,0,Kedeen O,76639849

35960603~COURSE!~HIWhL1UPEeiYKRJKvk-prg,1596462793483,3,0,"Pros: (1) A great effort to give an understanding of fit, prediction and commands in R. (2) It covers important commands.Cons: (1) The content was vague at times. Too much was left for the lecturer to tell and not enough visualizations provided in the video. Like what you do with data from the start of the EDA journey (There could have been a cheat sheet on the relation between the values (coefficients, p-values, etc).Two areas of improvements: (1) Use more visualiations in the lecture. Like explaining the summary outout in R. Perhaps there were technical odds of doing it in the video and that got translated into Reading material. (2) The Reading Material is not sequenced well. So, consider  'residual deviation'  and 'deviance residual'. What is the difference? I had to go to https://rpubs.com/fhernanb/deviance_glm to understand without any difficulty. As opposed to a lot of text in the Reading Materials, a notebook approach would be better. Attempt was made but it lacked the clarity of Rpubs. (3) The Practice Quiz was very easy while the multiple choice in the Final Quiz was baffling (since the Reading material was not adequate).Thank you. Hope this helps.",0,0,Debasish Kundu,35960603
