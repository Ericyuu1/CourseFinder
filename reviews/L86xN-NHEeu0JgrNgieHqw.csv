27654369~COURSE!~L86xN-NHEeu0JgrNgieHqw,1636660178444,1,0,"Nice idea, but the software used it cumbersome to work with. I would prefer doing my own split screen with BigQuery and the video, but it keeps prompting me to use the incognito tab to access BigQuery. However the password reset wasn't working. I unenrolled from the course.",0,0,Sara Sierschula,27654369
111950969~COURSE!~L86xN-NHEeu0JgrNgieHqw,1671288174326,2,0,Touched upon important points however was unclear on how to transition different parts. The course is outdates from the current format of datastudio which makes it difficult to follow. ,0,0,Mohsin Karim,111950969
111000490~COURSE!~L86xN-NHEeu0JgrNgieHqw,1661634629292,2,0,Very simple. The trial login functionality is very confusing. Content 1/5 - lacking depthExecution 2/5 - the login functionality was very bad. I doubt that people new to SQL would have understood the underlying logic.  The final exam did not test any technical competence.Delivery 4/5 - well presented but room for improvement. No opportunity to go in-depth so I can't evaluate your    ability to explain complicated concepts,0,0,Gurion Geppert,111000490
