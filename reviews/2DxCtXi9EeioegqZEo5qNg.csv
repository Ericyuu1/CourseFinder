They have enabled me to review and read more on the core content of each project.  They have made me go deeper into the subject matter, and I took time working with patients and their families with whom I worked through the projects.  I have continued working with some of the patients and their families, long after the assignment was completed and submitted. Thank you for a great course. I have learnt a great deal.
