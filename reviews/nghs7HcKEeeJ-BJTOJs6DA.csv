21669997~COURSE!~nghs7HcKEeeJ-BJTOJs6DA,1633796627336,3,0,"The course initially starts in a well paced manner, but week 2 onwards it is quite fast and I felt a bit difficult to follow, having to come back to it again and again. A bit of more explanation of the concepts, rationale and a better walk through of the commands used would be helpful.",0,0,Prashant Nair,21669997
50563991~COURSE!~nghs7HcKEeeJ-BJTOJs6DA,1651473102745,4,0,"Overall: very good intro to MongoDB Aggregation Framework. I'm now using it a lot afterwards.The exercises are mostly good to understand and very instructive. The quiz questions are often not very useful in my opinion. One point I missed: there are no slides/pdf. When I did the exercises and wanted to look something up from the previous lectures, I thought it was somewhat annoying to have to search through videos for the information. In other courses I liked it a lot when there were lecture slides as PDF that could be searched quickly.",0,1,Christian Borschel,50563991

29900901~COURSE!~nghs7HcKEeeJ-BJTOJs6DA,1535016007522,4,0,"The first two weeks are a good introduction to Aggregation and what you can do with it. The third week is more focused on using Mongo in machine learning applications and teaches you less new Mongo content and isn't in depth enough to be a good introduction to machine learning, but is a good way to get familiar with using the tools you've been shown earlier in the course. Some of the exercises are a little unclear in their wording but the course administrators are quick to reply in the forums and they update the workbooks in response to feedback. Overall would recommend to anyone who will be using Mongo and wants to get an overview of it's capabilities and some practise putting it into action.",0,6,Andrew McDowell,29900901
35201836~COURSE!~nghs7HcKEeeJ-BJTOJs6DA,1534090218676,4,0,Overall a good course. Some of the labs could be more intuitive and in one (I gave some feedback in the comments) has IMHO so false datasource. I also think that especially in Week3 some labs have to much information given and the student only has to do some minor tasks. ,0,1,Bernd Loigge,35201836
