If you either a) have any even small number of functional neurons and/or b) ever even casually partaken in any sort of ultrabasic business or science class (we're talking kindergarten level here), then you'd be able to make a better lecture than what is being offered here. Unfortunately, Coursera does not let one give <1 star. The major issues with this course include: i) absolute lack of organization - there is no discernible flow of ideas between lectures and units; ii) similarly complete lack of learning objectives - you basically end up having heard of prospect theory for the first time (unless you have encountered this concept before), but none of the materials in the course can be applied to anything; how do you perform market research? No idea, since that wasn't taught in the class; iii) instructor is woefully underprepared and presents the materials in unimaginative ways with very little apparent effort or thought put into the presentations or quiz questions; iv) and absolutely zero assignments given - how are you supposed to solidify newly acquired knowledge without practice?Lastly, the staged interviews with the ""model customer"" were painfully awkward, to say the very least. Not to mention that despite there having been somewhere around 10 or so interviews between the instructor and the model customer, they basically all had no information that wasn't completely intuitive to begin with (no kidding - she spends more time researching her options for a $1000+ laptop than on milk?! I've been living my life all wrong this entire time! (*Pardon the sarcasm*)). The cherry on top is that this was offered as a free 7-day trial, which then converted into a paid subscription for coursera. This course was not worth even a single month's payment. Interestingly enough, the reason I stayed subscribed was due to discovering another course, which is at the absolute other end of the quality scale - Andrew Ng's Machine learning course.

I've taken 4-5 courses on Coursera before and always found the quality top notch. Sorry to say but this particular course doesn't even begin to compare. I'm struggling to even get through the first week of videos. I find it unstructured and rather poorly presented. The important concepts that should be explained are being skimmed over but binary terms and concepts are delved into detail. The first two or three videos have an immense amount of repetition: same sentence/content repeated 2-3 times in a different manner.

However, if you’re looking for a course that can be completed with the provided materials, this isn’t it. There are issues addressed going back years on the student forums for each week relating to questions on the graded quizzes. Each week, there is at least one question that is not covered at all in the course material and when the information is sourced elsewhere, the answer found doesn’t match up with the course’s “correct” answer. Teaching assistants have replied That they will look into the issue, but here we are up to 5 years later and the questions aren’t corrected. Other tested content is only covered in power point presentations that one wouldn’t know existed unless they had scoured the forums for guidance. OVerall, I think Coursera needs to have the producers of this course pull it and make it accessible (or at least have the correct test answers) for students.
