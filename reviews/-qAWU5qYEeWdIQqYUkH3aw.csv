(The quiz questions tend to focus on course-content minutiae -- ""Which commentator said X about Y?"" -- to make sure you've drunk your art-establishment Kool-Aid.)On the other hand, if you want to examine the diversity of photography through a variety of critical approaches -- Marxist, feminist, queer-theory, post-structural, whatever -- well, they don't allow none of that there here.

Some of the required readings were lengthy and bombastic. It's almost as if course creators said, let's see what we have to work with, and try to find some relationships between the hodgepodge. I understand the importance of sometimes having to use readings from the specific time period of an artwork to put it in context, but again, I feel like there could have been better exemplars of both photographs and readings.

If this review is the only assessment we get beyond the quiz scores, my experience with it was not useful.

As a ""newbie"" to the Coursera community, I wanted to take a course that would expand my knowledge of art and culture while fitting within my hectic work and family schedule. Photography is something I engage in almost daily with my iPhone, so I took a chance and was not disappointed. Sarah Meister has curated a wonderful assortment of photographer artists that typify the historical and aesthetic advances in photography. The articles, videos, and slideshows were well constructed around the theme of each module. The articles would benefit from including some of the images discussed. This was not a major problem as I was able to Google most of them. The videos were interesting and of sufficient length not to strain my attention. The slideshows were my favored documents due to the inclusion of images and explanatory text. I did find it frustrating that some of the answers to the quiz assignments could not be found in the required reading, videos, or slideshows. As an educator, I can certainly understand wanting students to think critically but some of the questions were misleading, unanswerable based on the content, or appeared unrelated. Many of the items did not assess my understanding of the information so much as how closely I read for specific quotes or other esoteric content.

The content does not include enough 19th Century photography, European or American. Relating concepts to the origins and development of the medium is surely vital to a thorough understanding of contemporary issues.2. The sections of Additional Readings and Required Readings some of the links open up *pdf files with stupidly small print that more many people is too hard to read. These files should be converted to Word documents and saved with a readable print size. Otherwise it make some documents inaccessable to some learners.3.

Considering you have done all the course work and quizzes up to the end it seems quite arbitrary.  On another note I would like to suggest a project which became a book.  All too often today we view photographs in every moment of our lives but we are unaware of the the face of those creators and their iconic works.  MoMA's course seems a perfect opportunity to somehow introduce the subject.  the book is Behind Photographs - Archiving Photographic Legends by Tim Mantoani and MarkMurphy.BEHIND PHOTOGRAPHS: ARCHIVING PHOTOGRAPHIC LEGENDS began as the personal quest of photographer Tim Mantoani to document and preserve noted photographers together with their images. ""We have come to a point in history where we are losing both photographic recording mediums and iconic photographers,â Mantoani comments.

All aspects are of photography are necessarily condensed and sometimes basic but many different links and suggestion on further material is given for those who want to get deeper. If you like photography, if you want to understand it better, or even if you are just curious about this medium which is today in everybody's lives, you will hardly be disappointed by this course. The only negative aspects for me were that sometimes the material was difficult to read and that sometimes subtitles were not very good, but this latter is a problem only if you are not an English motherlanguage.

I have learned very much and, more than that, the course inspired me to keep learning by myself about the subject. I would suggest including other important names of  photographers, who were/ or are key people in the history of the medium. In some way, I came out of the corse with the impression that American photography was really the focus. Photographers from other nationalities where in focus when related to US someway. I missed that the course would have a broader vision to offer about photographers that were/are relevant in that medium. Cartier-Bresson and Robert Capa for instance were merely mentioned and Helmut Newton (maybe I missed), I didn't see him mentioned. My other suggestion is related to the quiz. Sometimes, the questions are focusing in aspects not really relevant of the theme of the week. There was a really relevant content and some questions would focus on for example the ""Edson Chagas distribute his work himself or not"" when his work has an important social impact to be called of the attention of the students. In the week 4,  the content related to posed/unposed photography for example was not included in the quiz when it was a key part of the message of the week's theme. So, my point is to review the quiz, including content which is relevant and it might be out, and prepare the questions not necessarily focusing in aspects that are not really adding to the learning of the student.Please feel free to ask if having interest in discuss my opinion further.Jussara Nunes Pereira de Souzajussaranpsouza@outlook.com",0,1,JussaraNunes Pereira de Souza,19345399

Its almost impossible to read from a cellphone. Some of the multiple choice questions on the exams were just too much, all due respect, edX continuous examination  works in a more efficient way.I hope MoMA do another interesting course on photography, perhaps specific subjects like landscape and street photography, and all the interesting subjects around them.

Such messages did not appear to arise in my opinion. The discussion about architectural preservation was worthwhile but not focused. The interviewer(s) concerned could have assisted by asking relevant questions of the artist(s) for the benefit of an audience with varied photographic interests.

There are those who choose to do so by putting an artistic touch that creates a very personal vision of the subject, and there are those who, on the other hand, prefer to reproduce reality as faithfully as possible. During this course we have seen many artists who have used photography in one way or another. Thanks to the interviews with the authors and above all thanks to Sarah Meister I was able to have a new and different perspective regarding the extent of the change from analogue to digital photography. I am a big fan of photography and of all genres, from landscapes, to portraits to macro photography to fine art and I know very well that there are many factors that can influence our photographic style, so we cannot limit the definition to a couple or even only to one. That's why I believe that this course for me was a great source of inspiration also for some ideas and photographic projects that I already have in mind. Each of us is the synthesis of all those things that have impacted our lives, the things and people that have surrounded us, the things we love, the things we hate, the things we admire and the things we have experienced. And it is in this human chaos that the use of a camera can help create those closets of memories and emotions, ugly or beautiful, old or new, certain and uncertain, but still moods of that moment. This course was a well-organized journey to experience very important pieces of the history of photography up close and I am very pleased to have done so. Thanks to the MoMA staff and in particular Sarah Meister for this great opportunity.

Photography is not just any picture or frame, it is what the photographer feels and sees. Photographers capture what touches them. They share their feelings through their work.
If you look closely at any work of any photographer, you can understand what this photographer wanted to show us, but not everyone can do this. Before, I did not understand art, I liked it, but I did not understand it. After this course, I became more confident when I look at a photo and talk about it. I can safely tell what is said in the photo. I began to look at the world differently, to see beauty in everything. It's great, because now I can draw inspiration from the photographs that surround me.",0,0,Aitolkun Tashbaeva,75838367

The ""Seeing Through Photographs"" course was an amazing experience for me. I really enjoyed learning about the beginnings of photography and how difficult the process was. Reading about the clash between professionals using large format cameras and amateurs using ""detective"" cameras was also fascinating, it seems that now 100 years later we have a similar clash between people using bulky DSLRs and people using mobile cameras. I also enjoyed discovering the history of Gordon Parks, who I only knew as the director of the ""Shaft"" movie. Moreover, watching the Harrell's Fletcher exhibition on ""The American War"" was very moving, it much reminded me of ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Platoon"" which I've just rewatched recently. On the other hand, I don't quite understand the latest digital works of Anouk Kruithof ""Subconscious Travelling"" and Lucas Blalock ""Strawberries"", but maybe I need to spend some more time to get the idea behind them.

Thousands of images pass before our eyes and it is very easy that, because of that, we end up simply consuming photography and that is not the way to see. Photographs must be read. With the course I have learned, apart from its history since its inception, to analyze it from various points, to see what it is, what it means and what it tries to mean. In this course I have learned to look carefully, analyze each of the details that make it up, study it and discover what it hides from us. Reflect on what we have read to draw conclusions, because photography is not just about seeing it, but by reading and analyzing it we get closer to the universe of the photographer and photography.Each photograph is made up of many planes of information, although independent, each one related to each other. To be able to read and analyze a photograph we must be aware at a narrative, compositional and technical level, all of this brings us closer to a reflection and an opinion and thus arrive at the purpose, style and process of each photographer.",0,0,David gil varela,71528283

11049966~COURSE!~-qAWU5qYEeWdIQqYUkH3aw,1520287278996,5,0,"This has been an excellent Course by MoMA on the Art and the medium of Photography! Mind you, it does not provide you with any technical skills or techniques at all. However, it handholds you through photography, from its inception up until the current era. During this process, it provides you with short yet excellent crafted excerpts from several photographers and their body of work, through brief  subtitled videos. Within seven Modules, the course explains in depth the meaning of photography, the importance of context, and how you should learn to ""read"" photos, not only as a passive spectator but more actively. During the course you will learn to appreciate photography not only in terms of light, composition or the synthesis and the subject, but by also considering the background of the creator, his/ her prejudices, the era when each photo was taken, the social context that led to the capture of each distinct photo etc. The course also successfully criticizes the use of photography, helping you identify what is the ambivalent meaning of each photo and how it is frequently manipulated by the media. To make things better, the Course encompasses rich online reading material (some directly from the MoMA library) and also several informative slideshows. In brief, this a magnificent, well-designed Course if you are passionate about understanding photography. It will provide you with a restart point towards photography and it will create an immense appetite to delve again into photography and to try to understand it, this time by having a richer background. All from the comfort of your home, through self-paced yet timed Modules' sessions. An excellent course! Kudos to MoMA and Sarah Meister for crafting it.",0,17,Yannis Larios,11049966
