accepted all around the world. But the price is too expensive for me to afford
the fee, because my school administration reduced my salary because of the economical
problems they faced.So I need
financial aid for the certificate program.Please help me. 2- I graduated from university in 2011 and during these
years, in education world there have been too many new methods & systems
which enable teachers to teach better. Because when I was at university as a
student, we had just the blackboard and data shows in our classes. However, now
we have multimedia rooms which include smart boards and other technological
devices that enable students and teacher enjoy and learn in the class. So I
hope that throughout this program, I will learn too many new, useful tips to
use in my class and   motivate my students to take part during the
lesson.  If I achieve to motivate my students,
they will learn better .They will improve their English level.Another advantage
of this certificate program for my career is that I will get an excellent
verified certificate which enables me to reach my goals. After having this
certificate, I will apply to any colleges and I will get a job in the world as
an English teacher.3-I can not accept
