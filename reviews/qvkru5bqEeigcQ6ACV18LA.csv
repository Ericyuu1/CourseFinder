39062717~COURSE!~qvkru5bqEeigcQ6ACV18LA,1595087546828,3,0,"The course was no doubt excellent. At the end of the day you are going to earn a mouth watering certificate signed by one of the best computer scientists in the world. Prof. Mark de Berg. Professor speaks english very well and hence no one will face any problem related to language.  Also professor taught the course extremely well. But unfortunately this course is completely inactive. All the questions in discussion forums remains unanswered. There was a problem is Week 2 Assignment 'PTAS for Load Balancing', where your correct answer will be considered wrong. Mentors of this course are sitting idle. They do not provide any assistance to the students. This course really needs a mentor who is active. ",0,2,Suryendu Dalal,39062717

36627517~COURSE!~qvkru5bqEeigcQ6ACV18LA,1620110086386,5,0,Short but compact course that discusses important topics. The quizes and programming homeworks are challenging enough to help to check your studying procedure. Prof. Mark de Berg is an amazing instructor and gives clear lecture videos. One small tip will be to check the Errata sheet before studying. Overall a compact and helpful course.,0,1,김동윤,36627517
