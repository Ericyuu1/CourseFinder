For example NOP ops in buffer / stack overflow exploiting are to align memory, so you could need to put more than one NOP, but in the video is like if you cannot put more. Examples in Command Injection are to basic, more than that, so the concept is as basic as the example, there are a lot of imaginative ways to do, and the same goes for SQL Injection, MITRE database is plenty full of very good examples.I cannot loose my time with this kind of courses, i expected much more, and found just the same empty literature as in any other book or web page telling the super hacker secrets",0,1,Carlos López Pastor,95671396

29017208~COURSE!~4mQMlbmSEea2MQq2IjylnA,1516642861788,2,0," I'm sorry that I have to give a bad rating on a course with such a rare  but highly interesting topic. But while the assignments indeed made me  learn a lot, pretty much nothing in this course is really well made.- Chow's English is really hard to follow- Chow's talks frequently get interrupted in the middle of the sentence by quizzes that pop up during the video lectures-  Those (ungraded) quizzes often refer to later parts of the talk  actually, so with no further knowledge you'll often have to guess at the  point in time when they are presented- After almost every video, a readings page is  presenting some links, and many if not most of them are broken. The URLs  have to be manipulated in different ways to get the actual content.-  The assignments require you to use Amazon's commercial AWS service. AWS  offers a free tier for basic usage, but this free tier won't be enough  to complete the last assignment, where you won't be charged much (unless  you make some mistake), but you will be charged nonetheless. (Even for  the free tier, registration is not possible without entering credit card  information.)- The assignments of this course assume that you have  an AWS instance set up exactly as described in course 1 of this  specialization. If you didn't enroll in that course, there is no  information given to you at all on how about to set this up, and you  have to rely on somebody giving you a link to the according PDF in the  forums.- The last assignment requires to clone a certain AWS Machine  Image, which is not available any more. Some learner set up a replacement for it and posted instructions  on how to use it, rather than Chow and his team.- The assignment  documents miss any information on how to use some of the tools it does  use. If you don't know how to transfer a file via SSH or use the VI  editor, you'll have to google that yourself.- In the descriptions of  the actual tasks, the assignment documents contain several critical  errors, e.g. wrong file or variable names, so if you follow the words of  the instructions perfectly, you won't be able to complete any of the  assignments.- In the end of assignments 1 and 2, you are expected to  submit series of screenshots, but are neither given an ""Upload"" button  in the ""Submit assignment"" page nor any instructions on how to proceed  otherwise.- When reviewing the assignments from others, there are no  criteria given based which you should give points; it's always just  ""Does the learner know how to...? (yes/no/partly)"", usually no information on  what to expect in the answers and when to give the full amount of points  or a part of it. This will not only make reviewing much harder than it  should be, you will also receive very different amounts of points from  different reviewers for the same assignment, even though due to the  nature of the tasks the results are usually pretty much either fully  correct or completely incorrect.I (and fellow learners) reported  several such issues both via the ""Report problem"" button on each page  and the discussion forums. It was not before the very end of my  enrollment, but I finally received some feedback from Chow's staff,  thanking me for my reports and telling me that they ""are currently  looking into resolving this issues"" and, just a bit later, that ""a  revised version of [one assignment document] has been uploaded"". So there is a chance that the course  will improve in the future (though I did not spot a single improvement in said document on a quick look).  ",0,23,Yannick  Schmitt,29017208
