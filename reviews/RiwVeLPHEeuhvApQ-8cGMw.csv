35135161~COURSE!~RiwVeLPHEeuhvApQ-8cGMw,1659736672835,2,0,"I enjoyed the class as it added to my knowledge and was organized nicely.However, the transcripts were riddled with mistakes, worse than I've seen with any coursera course.  I had some familiarity with the topic and was able to correct the translation from spoken to written but a better system needs to be installed when using a lot of very specific scientific terminology.  What ever system you were using, it didn't work.  I realize this course came from Korea and perhaps English was not the professor's first language but it was quite laughable to see the riducules mistakes made for words such as kinase (kindness( and binding (combined) when the professor was saying the correct term.In addition, the quiz and exam questions were poorly written with a number of grammar mistakes making it difficult to interpret the questions.",0,0,Vickie Rae Roettger,35135161

It did not go into all the details of each signaling pathway but provided basic and important information. so, It is so suitable for people with no background. The only problem was the english subtitle, some words were mistransleted and It could be confusing.",0,1,Parnia karimian,76139067

But since we can not download any slide,  this is a disadvantage since there are a lot of images essential to understand the signaling. So i would like to request to avail the option of dowloading the slides. ",0,0,preyanka nath,13417796
69151650~COURSE!~RiwVeLPHEeuhvApQ-8cGMw,1651060722675,5,0,"This is a very interesting course, and useful in understanding the cell signaling pathways. This is very useful for understanding the development of cancer cells, their metastasis using cells signals. It is also useful to understand and try to explain some of the cells signals that maybe affected by messengers cells. The professor who taught this explains well with his diagrams and teaching.",0,1,WEE FONG CHONG,69151650

108844~COURSE!~RiwVeLPHEeuhvApQ-8cGMw,1641864162122,5,0,"T​his is an excellent course on topics that are very important in biological and medical science. They are especially important in my field (clinical haematology and oncology). As just one example, many tyrosine kinase inhibitors effective against various malignancies have been developed. These agents inhibit pathways driving uncontrolled proliferation of the malignant cells. Knowledge of these pathways is essential for development of these and other new treatments for many diseases, not just cancer. I think that the professor presented the material in about as clear and concise a manner as is possible.  I should note that my background in medicine and research in biochemistry made the material very comprehensible to me, and I knew quite a bit of it already. Nevertheless, I think that anyone with even minimal knowledge or interest in biology, biochemistry, medicine, etc., would benefit from this course, especially in view of the importance of the topics.",0,2,G Davies,108844
