cancer. It starts with a brief history and remarkable discoveries by scientists,
followed by its mechanism, case studies in animal models, cohort studies, and
eventually its implementation in cancer therapy. It is very intriguing filled
with quizzes, learning resources (podcasts, debates, research findings,
interviews, and newspaper articles) and not to mention the ever-growing
