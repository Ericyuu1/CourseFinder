3426149~COURSE!~6Fa6w3EjEeWbbw5cIAKQrw,1457641086786,2,0,"Good:  The video lectures cover a nice variety of topics giving you a good introduction of journalism, ethics, and other important considerations for becoming a journalist.Bad:  The entire course feels hastily put together.  Some of the videos have summarizing points, which is helpful when taking notes, but they flash on the screen briefly, then cut to a closeup of the lecturer, then cut back to the summery points so quickly that you can't copy them down and it becomes super distracting.The quizzes are a joke.  They usually consist of 1-3 questions with two answers each and once choice so outrageous that they don't take any thought at all to complete.  You could just skip to the quizzes without watching a single lecture and ""ace"" them easily.The assignments are also a joke.  They ask for 1-2 sentence answers max!  Some of them ask you to ""use more than one word"" to respond.  I've taken free courses on here than involve 1000 word essays and then at least you're forced to process the information in the lectures.  You can pass this course without watching a single lecture and that's a travesty to Michigan State.It is full of typos and oversights that could have been avoided if they had once person run through the course as a quality control.  One of the quizzes has the answer included right beneath the question as a typo!  The simple assignments are described in 3 different places, sometimes with conflicting instructions.  They tell you what to do and how to review your peers in one section and then the actually assignment has different instructions on what to do than the page prior so you end up unsure of what the assignment actually wants you to do.  For example:  the final assignment at firsts asks you how to engage with your audience, and then you click next and the SAME question is now asking you how you distribute content.  Did they even try??In Summery:  The content in the lectures are a good but shallow overview of journalism, but don't expect to be challenged to do anything but fill in ovals and regurgitate questions.Not too much to learn here.",0,6,Thomas Fitch,3426149

Quizzes are alternating between very good and very bad. Tough ethical decisions and a space to discuss them is a really great thing, but peer grading two phrases essays with only the ability of telling yes or no doesn't make for a good use of the crowdsourcing the very course is advocating.The videos seem to have been made with an indecent knowledge of the technology, especially for journalists who are supposed to use it daily; green screens were used so badly as some parts of the professors ""spark white"", and slides are often cut away and put back in view while the teacher is talking about it, which was downright infuriating.It still qualifies for a very good opening course in journalism, but needs serious improvement.",0,0,Daniele Latella,3488972

It would definitely be worthwhile to do so. - Please check spelling and other mistakes in the transcripts.  - The evaluating standards are too polarized: either perfect (33 points) or wrong (?) 0 points.
