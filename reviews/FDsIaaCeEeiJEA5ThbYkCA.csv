If you are a novice R programmer like I am,  you will need to grow your R knowledge. If your knowledge of differential equations is rusty, like mine, do not despair.  If you've never taken a class in differential equations or calculus--you will need to understand the equations at an intuitive level.  Understand that differential equations express change in quantities over time and their solutions are the values themselves over time..  Learning the required inputs to deSolve and understanding  its outputs  is absolutely critical to success in this course.  I had a lot of issues with the Jupyter pages.  I never figured out how to copy and paste R code to the Jypyter cells or from previous pages as was suggested in Week 3.  I had some background in epidemic models from another Coursera MOOC using spreadsheets and difference equations.   I learned a great deal of additional material from this course.
