I was impressed with the instructor's enthusiasm and engagement (and have already signed up for another of his philosophy courses), and I loved whimsical the ""For All We Know"" vignettes that began most units. 
As is my habit, I have written a more detailed account of my experience of the course on my personal blog at https://sloopie72.wordpress.com/2022/09/27/epistemology-mooc-what-do-you-know/",0,0,Karen Carlson,1595031
