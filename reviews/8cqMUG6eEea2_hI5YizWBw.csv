Unfortunaly it uses terms which are not clear for someone who is at the begging and moreover there's no proper explanations or no explanation at all about that meaning of some words using in this sector. The examples are not always clear. I always have to go and check what something means on google...The professor is simply reading and not explaining. Every course that I did I did in English, in this one I tried to see if it will be easier doing this course in Italian which is my mother tongue, but the translation it's not at all good and clear that actually for me was easier to follow all the course  in English.

But I have always had a BIG Problem with courses in which the Professor's use ""Slides"" and do NOT actually ADD Value to the slides. I would say there is TREMENDOUS room for improvement of the course if the Professor would be willing to go BEYOND just the mere ""Re-statement"" of the Equations (That anyone who is not visually impaired can easily read for themselves) and actually provide some additional context. Actually, the Professor in this course does this, somewhat, but only VERY minimally, and NOT nearly ENOUGH! :)However, I definitely don't want to be totally Negative, the (albeit VERY brief) comments the Professor made indicating HOW the information (values calculated from equations, values of ratios, etc) could actually be USED did provide me with some more insight than I would have been able to come up with on my own. And getting ""more"" insight than I, myself, can come up with on ""my own"" is basically the ONLY reason I want to ""take"" an ""educational"" course. However, one of the things, I myself, have consistently had to deal with in an attempt to ""learn"" about Investing is that book knowledge (or in the case of this course, data and text from slides), is not really enough. What I constantly search for is ""insights from the ""Experts"". I have no doubt the Professor is an expert in the subject and it would have been better, for me, if he had been willing to share more of his ""nuanced"" expertise with the students. However, I recognize this is ""just"" an  ""Intro"" course, so I likely have been a bit too negative than I should be. And I actually was reasonably ""satisfied"" with the course. Probably this review should be classified in the category of someone whose expectations for course was somewhat unrealistic.Finally, not even sure if I need to say this because it was so blatant, but there was a consistent amount of ERRORS in the Slides also! Essentially, the errors amounted to some lines of data from a previous equation being repeated for a new ratio calculation in the Week 1 material and then occasional errors where the material in the slide was different from the Professor's stated numbers in his lectures.",0,21,Michael Friedman,2197792
