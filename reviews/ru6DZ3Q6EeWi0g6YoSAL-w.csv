18624421~COURSE!~ru6DZ3Q6EeWi0g6YoSAL-w,1502587656633,2,0,"Three stars seems too much, two stars too few.First and foremost, I couldn't stand the lecturer. The course description says ""Taught by:  Alison Murray, Ph.D, Associate Professor"" but she never so much as appears on camera. Instead the material is delivered by some graduate student dressed up in what I would have assumed was a cartoonist's stereotype of paleontological field gear, and he has the most annoying, grating presentation style I've ever seen. I ended up covering his half of the screen with another window just to not have to watch him. Still had to listen to him though, delivering a script which I infer was written by Murray and other faculty. (I signed up for Ancient Marine Reptiles allegedly taught by Michael Caldwell and Halle P. Street — and in reality it was the same grad student. Same outfit. I said ""oh no"" and didn't continue. Couldn't take four more weeks of that guy.) Come on, how about courses taught by actual faculty members? Like The Science of the Solar System, taught by the engaging and accomplished Prof. Mike Brown, discoverer of Eris?The material is largely ""here's a Latin name of a family, here's a Latin name of a member of that family, here are some of its physiological characteristics (more unfamiliar vocabulary) — lather, rinse, repeat."" Forget about passing the quizzes if you can't remember which Latin species name goes with which characteristics. I felt there was too much emphasis on individual species and not enough on overall concepts. I didn't feel I came away with a real understanding of what happened and why it happened in early vertebrate evolution... some of that was there, but it wasn't clear enough, obscured as it was by emphasis on vocabulary and rote description.",0,0,Richard Holmes,18624421
32894695~COURSE!~ru6DZ3Q6EeWi0g6YoSAL-w,1529081541750,3,0,"The information presented was very good, though the heavy use of scientific names for various grades, clades, physical features, and assorted trait classifications was kind of overwhelming for such a short and introductory course. Perhaps the lectures could be broken up into shorter videos to have a narrower field of coverage for each one, so only a few new terms are presented at a time. The phylogenetic tree viewer still had many ""locked"" cards the last time I was sent to it, and no new organisms listed since module 1 or 2 even though many had already been discussed. The closed captioning and the sound seemed to be off in many places, though perhaps this was due to a poor wifi connection on my part.The biggest problem I had was with the presenter himself. Not only is he dressed like Indiana Jones for some odd reason; but his jerky, bouncy movements, exaggerated facial expressions, flailing hands and theatrical voice inflection made him VERY hard to watch and concentrate on the material presented. I actually had to pause quite a few times just to give myself a break from watching him twitching all over the place.",0,4,DC,32894695

sobre la evolución de los vertebrados, gracias por darme su apoyo económico y
por darme todo ese excelente material de apoyo y guías que brindan para cada
semana. Los felicito por hacer un curso tan completo y gracias por apoyar mis
estudios y avances en materia paleontológica; espero que algún día pueda
agradecerles personalmente. Con mucho cariño Camilo Mejía Rivera.
Medellín, Colombia. Estos son mis más
gratificantes y excelentes aprendizajes mientras desarrollaba el curso de Paleontología:
evolución temprana de los vertebradosAprendí a diferenciar las
estructuras en los diferentes seres vivos desde el ordovícico, devónico y
silúrico, las cuales nos ayudan a identificar como fue la evolución de las
especies desde los cordados (ancestros primarios) hasta los tetrápodos
(nuestros parientes con cuatro extremidades)

Aprendí las diferentes funciones de las estructuras presentes en los seres
vivos ancestros de los vertebrados y su respectiva manera y carácter de
evolución.Aprendí
sobre los diferentes periodos geológicos (ordovícico, devónico y silúrico), el
cómo era la tierra en estos periodos, como era el clima, las cantidades de
oxígeno, dióxido de carbono, las rocas y especies características de cada
periodo, además de las diferentes tasas de origen y extinción de especies.Aprendí
a distinguir entre los espacios de acumulación geológicos, sobre cuáles son los
mejores para poder haber acumulaciones de seres vivos y su posterior etapa de
fosilización; también sobre los eventos que generan una excelente instancia
para que los fósiles conserven sus partes de la mejor manera (anóxico).Aprendí
sobre como es el estudio mancomunado de los geólogos y paleontólogos para
describir cómo era la especie y como era el entorno en que se desarrolló.

Aprendí a distinguir sobre los nichos que fueron determinantes para el
desarrollo de la especie y como estos eran aprovechados por otras especies.Aprendí
sobre como los diferentes ancestros de los vertebrados que a partir de la
necesidad desarrollaron su capacidad de filtrado de comida, su capacidad
sensitiva debajo del agua, su mordida, sus dientes, la evolución de los huesos
y cartílagos, la variación en forma y uso de las aletas; y como todos estos
aspectos evolucionaron para que los tetrápodos pudieran apoyar sus cuerpos en
cuatro extremidades, para que pudieran ver en el aire y no en el agua, para que
pudieran escuchar en el aire y no en el agua.Aprendí
a Usar el árbol filogenético de la Universidad de Alberta, además de aprender
mucho sobre la formación de la luna, formación de la tierra y eventos
importantes que ocurrieron en la historia de la tierra para que esta sea hoy lo
que es.Aprendí
de lugares importantes paleontológica y geológicamente hablando, de los cuales
se extraen las diferentes especies en excelente estado para su posterior
estudio. ",0,1,Camilo Mejía Rivera,26893923
