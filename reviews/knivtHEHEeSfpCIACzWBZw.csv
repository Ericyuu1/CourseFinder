However, I did not appreciate that there was misinformation seemingly being purposefully spread and the content being presented in an unscientific manner. This was especially evident for the hallucinogens section of week 3 wherein they make claims absolutely contrary to the most recent literature, stating that hallucinogens like LSD are somehow 'neurotoxic' when the evidence points towards these hallucinogens actually promoting neurogenesis and being neuroprotective. My only defence for this course is that it must of been made a couple of years ago, and the academics behind the course may not be up to date on the current literature.

82731811~COURSE!~knivtHEHEeSfpCIACzWBZw,1620726139914,1,0,"I wondered why Prof Kuhar offered that course as he did not
seem interested or motivated.There are lots of videos that last only 4 or 5 minutes
and still they contain numerous repetitions of the same fact and summaries of
past videos and the current one. Some basic things were explained in great
detail while more complex ones were just named, so I had to look them up on the
internet. In his videos Kuhar refers again and again to other sources that
participants should use to learn more. The reading recommendations at the end
of every week invariably list Kuhar’s book, which is also called The Addicted
Brain and that you have to buy as you cannot access it here. I wondered if
selling that book was the main motivation to offer that course. It did not come
as a surprise that this course if one of those where you can only access the
quizzes every week to control your progress if you have paid for the course. What really disturbed me was that he is still claiming that
opioid medication does not create addiction if it is prescribed by a doctor and
taken as prescribed. There is a raging opioid crisis in USA mainly because the
Sackler family pretended that their Oxycontin would not cause addiction.
Doctors believed that with the result of hundreds of thousands of addicted patients,
many of whom died from unvoluntary overdoses. How can a professor of
pharmacology ignore that dangerous and deadly lie that made the Sackler’s
billions of dollars. Criminal charges are pending as we speak?  Whose interests does he represent? All in all it seems to me that you
learn more facts and get more reliable information about the addicted brain if
you simply research on the internet on your own.   ",0,4,Cornelia Mann,82731811

It genuinely seemed to me that they think it has no health benefits.

The course does an overall solid job of teaching the student about the mechanisms of action of certain drugs and how they can neurologically cause addiction. It also does a pretty solid job at teaching the sociological viewpoints as well; such as environmental risk factors and etc. A bit of a problem that I found was the professor had an entire lecture on the opioid epidemic yet didn't speak about how the opioid epidemic was caused largely by Purdue Pharma and other companies promoting their drugs by lobbied lawmakers, sponsoring continuing medical-education courses, and other unethical ways. Which is understandable considering it's a basic course but if you're going to have an entire lecture on it it might be worth it to explain the major fuel in the crisis. The professor was also very solid on how marijuana legalization may do more harm than good due to more availability. Which is understandable in terms of neurological risks/ addiction (and considering this course is an addiction course) however it leaves out the part how Black people are 4 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana than white people. From my personal opinion, marijuana should be treated like alcohol within our society so I feel as though the professor pushing how marijuana legalization isn't a good idea because it's not approved by the FDA is a bit dangerous for progressive policies and unrooting the systematic racism within American drug policies and laws. But despite my couple of concerns this course is in all a very solid and well built course, loved the way the professor spoke about neurology but I would have love to seen some more intersectionality be discussed when the professor speaks about legalization since a big part of drug criminalization ties into race. But for a basic addiction course, very solid. ",0,0,Victoria Gonzalez,95576866

First, the course clearly distinct between addiction and dependence. From there, it classifies various classes (10 to be specific) of addicting drugs, which includes caffeine! As a biologist, what caught my attention were the animations that beautifully explained the neurotransmission process and how it is altered by drugs in the discussion. Michael Kuhar is an excellent instructor. I am confident that I could understand 99 % of the very relevant information provided in this course.
