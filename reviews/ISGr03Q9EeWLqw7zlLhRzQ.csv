Even though the assignment maybe marked as private so the public may not be able to hear it.  It is accessible by fellow students and it involves an employees work performance and trying to coach and counsel them.  No thought was given to the possible embarrassment of the employee interviewed or recorded.  Also many states have statutes in regards to recording a private conversation.  This was a bad idea for an assignment.  ,0,7,Jeff Casselman,46726902
