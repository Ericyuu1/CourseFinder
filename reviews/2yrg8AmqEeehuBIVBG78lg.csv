31547020~COURSE!~2yrg8AmqEeehuBIVBG78lg,1589727887649,3,0,"Pros:-Good path. you can really start from 0 and build the knowledge to a certain level-Video length and materials are also good (even if the sound is not so great)-Exercises and peer revision is just great! learned a lot from my colleagues' perspective! I think it is far better than quizes to make you think on what you learned.Cons:-Old data. often we are talking about data from 90's or 2000's. The most recent set of data I remember from the course is >5 years-Too much food oriented (i work with product development and the examples shown are quite tough to understand, even having some experience). food trucks, cereal, restaurants... The drill example was just awesome. It is not clear why we didn't follow that path more often-Lack of references. This is the single biggest contributor for my low rating. In different cases it is hard to tell if we are talking about a validated model, an idea, an opinion, work from papers or any other source. Sometimes it would be nice to go deeper, or just to know more on how the authors got to their conclusions.The topic is great and the instructor certainly has a lot of knowledge in the area, but at some point i just didn't feel like finishing this (even if I watched all the videos)... It is worth it to have an idea on the field, but you will need further info to put any of these in practice.",0,5,Pedro Marques,31547020

So, that can be a mildly good to see how you have performed. However, since it is graded by your peers, some may not necessarily honest in rating your grades.
