53998144~COURSE!~CF-ULqSTEemZwA5BVRBUoA,1652784282342,4,0,"The descriptions of how to approach and characterize learning with a disabled child was very enligtening for me, so I am thankful. However, I've felt like a lot of time was used to transfer little informations at times. The course also stayed theoretical at times, like for example regarding good communication between colleagues. It is of course important to maintain good contact within a team, but more ideas on how to apply that practically should have been given. ",0,0,Clément De Brouwer,53998144
