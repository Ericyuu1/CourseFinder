41195652~COURSE!~T_hpstgKEeSA2iIAC22KLw,1656145344216,5,0,"I have never expected to describe a completed online course, let alone an audit-only one, as “pivotal,” but here we are. Is it really possible to make a digestible overview of a complex, yet indispensable, perspective that is Sustainable Development, and to do so without trimming excessive content? This offering, helmed by Professor Jeffrey Sachs, PhD, proves that it is. While the audio-visuals are not extraordinary, but expected from outputs of topnotch institutions and leaders of the field, the content and the story crafted from it definitely are. The last time I felt a similar level of awe while taking and after completing a MOOC was when I took “Mountains 101” by the University of Alberta. Interestingly, “Mountains 101” also has officially at least 12 weeks’ worth of content. Perhaps, both the course length and the apparent dedication & expertise by the makers are essential ingredients to make an online course unforgettable.

Sustainable development, by itself, is interdisciplinary and comprehensive. True to these characteristics of the topic, the course demonstrates the same. Professor Sachs is perhaps one of the few, if not the only one, who have the sufficient amount of experience and expertise to effortlessly make the individual subtopics and their connections clear to casual audiences. Most importantly, for me, this course provides, in detail, the reasons to be disappointed of the current state of affairs and, simultaneously, the reasons to keep our heads up in striving for change that benefits the greatest number of people – the currently-living and the generations of yet-to-be-born. Furthermore, the quizzes are excellently made and generally utilize authoritative resources. Regardless of your current standing in life, you will be encouraged to “get dirty” and examine unforgiving research/statistical data that form the basis of sensible policies and forecasts.

The only flaw I can think of regarding the course is that it is outdated. Since the course’s release circa 2015, much have changed in the planet and, as a species, we have been experiencing several pinpoint-able events that can make or break (or are already making or breaking) the global community and its constituents. In connection with this, some of the internet links leading to resources needed to answer some questions are already dead (with a little bit of taking advantage of context clues, though, the same or similar resources can be located). A possible update of this course will likely include an adjustment of the optimism/pessimism (on our collective capacity to bring about timely sustainable development) demonstrated in the material.

At the end of the course, I feel “well-rounded” in the understanding of the world around me in terms of matters beyond my field of training (healthcare). Overall, I believe that this course, or any resource on understanding sustainable development, should be watched and/or read by everyone. Little by little, accompanied by on-going events that are causing hardship to numerous people worldwide, we realize that our action, or inaction, on sustainable development is a pressing concern on both existential and moral grounds.",0,1,Aedrian Abrilla,41195652

I thoroughly enjoyed the course and definitely expanded my understanding of the environment and where we stand on sustainability. I cannot say enough about the course content, really!

Several links that appear during the course (i.e. in the weekly tests) often take you to updated content while the question is linked to an earlier year or some other content altogether. I would suggest using Google wisely to hit upon the right content or trawl through the discussion forums where a mentor might have added the right link. I must commend the mentors too who respond promptly and efficiently. Another bit I wasn't aware of is that there is no certificate so in case that is your agenda, then I would suggest hop across to https://www.edx.org/course/age-of-sustainable-development-2 where one can avail of a certificate and I believe the SDGS are updated as well.

He has incredible professional background in the subject matter, and it was exciting to hear about his personal involvement in creating international agreements.

   I would recommend this course for anyone who wants to learn more about international relations, politics, economics, world history, environmental science, healthcare, or international development. He really covers a lot! There's something for everyone, whether you have no previous knowledge or have already taken a few similar classes. I loved how everything was in a predictable format of five 10-25 minute videos in each section with a 10-question quiz at the end. The videos were very engaging because they had interesting b-roll and even music! It felt like a documentary in a way. (Of course, you can also speed them up by making them play 1.25-1.5 speed.)  My only suggestion for improvement is for the TAs (or whomever) to go back through the quiz website links and update them.

Actually, I didn't know the Golden rules of sustainable development in such a details. I learned about social economic growth, the threats of poverty as well as environmental protection topic in such a beautiful ways that I never had chance to learn before. Furthermore, Rural and Urban relationship and the issues of income and comparison of wellbeing between the two segregated groups of people who are living for 1000s of years. In addition to that, I learned how important is the relationship between culture, education, and gender issues in the rural area and how strongly it impact the human being (negative or Positively ) life the community. Moreover, I learned about the environmental changes and threatening of Global Food Security system and Global Food Supply . Sustainable Cities and the patterns of the urbanization were another important part in these lectures. Climate Changes and its impact on Global Security and Future threats were very important topics which drew my attention. 
Very outstanding program which I had chance through Coursera Program to learn and add to my knowledge. I will definitely share all these information in my family, community, network and in my career life and will voluntarily advocate for the SDG goals for our future generation. 
I love DrJeffrey Sachs. I respect him and respect his knowledge and the job he has been doing to our generation and our grand kids. 

Thanks everyone who helped, managed, and developed such a amazing program .

I found Professor Sachs course immensely valuable in building a deeper understanding of humanity's most urgent treats and possible ways forward in the Antropocene age. To effect the desire outcomes, the course should be compulsory for policy makers, corporate board members, educators, students, change-agents, as well as citizens at large. However, it can be strongly argued if sustainable development goals are collectively feasible or a paradox when economic models and growth metrics used by most economies continue to ignore environmental impacts, Earth's finite resources, and systemic economic inequality. A systems approach to restructuring economic models is needed. We need an economic system that protects our shared commons and promotes better corporate governance - that includes comprehensive accounting of the biocapacity of the planet and our environmental impacts, and, a broader metric of human well-being (vs. GDP) that reduces economic inequality and internalizes externalities. In short, a new economic paradigm must be in place.
