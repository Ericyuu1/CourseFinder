Week 1 is straightforward and encouraging; nonetheless, if you plan to get an overview of Quantum Mechanics and atoms, it is a good overview to navigate your learning.

1785568~COURSE!~sgMQv8_-EeufchLeGgZGZQ,1642686736319,5,0,It's very interesting course. I get understading about quantum mecanics in short time. But at week1 will be very useful give more information about complex number and at week4 some examples of propability calculations and vector description of two spin states.,0,1,Yury Vikulin,1785568
