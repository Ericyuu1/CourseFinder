As an undergraduate research project we have taken up ""Friction stir welding and processing of aluminium alloys"" as our domain of work. By studying corrosion, we are thinking of enhancing our study and analysis and by involving ""Corrosion study of Friction stir welded aluminium alloys"" apart from the usual Tensile testing, Impact testing, Micro hardness and Micro structure study that we usually do.For the same reason I have taken up the course. It was a great course and I suggest that an advance level course on corrosion study should also be uploaded on Coursera.
