I am far away from being satisfied with Channel Management and
Retailing course. 
Language
barrier is a huge issue – at times it was extremely difficult for
me to understand what actually the lecturer meant, as the way she
structures her sentences doesn't make much sense in English, plus
some words were inaudible and even subtitles didn't help. 
Second
big issue is the structure of the material – very chaotic and
unstructured. It was difficult to catch her drift.And
lastly, big part of the material is outdated – citing articles and
researches from 2009, 2010 and 2015 from nowadays perspective seems a
bit irrelevant – for example the whole part about online retailing.I
do not recommend this course as I barely found any use of it. As, I
