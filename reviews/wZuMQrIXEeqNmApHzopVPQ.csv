77398452~COURSE!~wZuMQrIXEeqNmApHzopVPQ,1610138394311,2,0,Really fluffy stuff focused only on cycling in Western Europe and the USA. Did not learn a lot. :/,0,1,Mariano Morán,77398452
25020258~COURSE!~wZuMQrIXEeqNmApHzopVPQ,1671742632229,3,0,"The resources and discussions in this course are centered around promoting urban cycling. While that's a great goal for reclaiming the street, there's more to urban spaces than bike lanes. I would have liked to see more of an emphasis on parklets, shared streets, etc. Also, I think the content is very academic and theoretical, especially the journal articles and webinar recordings. If you want to feel like you're taking a college class, go for it. If you're more of a casual student that's taking a course to explore a hobby or as a change of pace, there are probably better options out there.",0,1,Robert Pacey,25020258
633525~COURSE!~wZuMQrIXEeqNmApHzopVPQ,1650056497712,3,0,"I​ have no complaint about course content but the way it was conducted is very impersonal despite it is about having communication. None of the instructors emails were provided even for the period the content was accessed. Whatever the questions and quizes were asked it seems to be that the instructors wanted more ideas for their future research rather than sharing that information with other learners. We don't know who else was in the class. This class is is no difference from the Youtube videos. As it was communicated as a certificate cource, Please send a proper certificate to my email address that I can print. A digital certificate cost is covered in my fee, hopefully. Best regards, Aruna Reddi",0,0,arunasri,633525

You will learn about the theory and practice of tactical urbanism, of local initiatives, with examples and analysis that enrich the discussion, as well as strategies to improve our neighborhoods. I am sure that I will carry out the activity that I presented as an action plan. They inspired me a lot, thank you for that!",0,0,Liliana López León,54052568

48011453~COURSE!~wZuMQrIXEeqNmApHzopVPQ,1599386350563,5,0,"What is refreshing about this course is that it challenges students to get outside their comfort zones where they are. Creating change in public space will inevitably require a change of approach. Being that person who stands apart from normal behaviour and challenges widely held norms helps others think for themselves, and start conversations with their groups.Academic understanding is powerful, but when it comes to reclaiming streets from cars, it takes action. This course is a great overview and practical starter for being effective on the street.",0,0,Alex Dyer,48011453

But reading those scientific articles within the suggested 45 Min. wasn't possible - more like twice the time if your mother tongue isn't English. Enjoyed it anyway and will think about completing another course once I'm recovered :)",0,0,Ines Teichert,68120863
