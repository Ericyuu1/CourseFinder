Some of the material is very historical, useful I think but maybe the balance should shift a little more to the present. Great detail expected to be understood on public and private keys, on which is which and where. Given that detail that is required, more time should be taught on teaching it simply rather than reading the historical mathematical papers. It was not helpful to have to grade others. First, it is the blind leading the blind. Second, the grading software did not seem to work well. I could not give more than one point for a particular question, even though it seemed to invite us to do so (one for correct answer, a second for a good explanation).
