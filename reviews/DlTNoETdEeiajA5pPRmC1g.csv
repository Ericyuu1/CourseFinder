94509522~COURSE!~DlTNoETdEeiajA5pPRmC1g,1637103097156,2,0,"I took the course as a general review of information I had not specifically studied in some time.  It was surprising that so little new information was available. It seemed almost as if nothing had changed since 1990 when I was originally studying for my MSW.I also found that some of the quiz questions were poorly worded or were unclear, more than one had a typo.  The answer to the question on ""means tested"" meaning stated ""enough wealth to LIVE themselves out of poverty-clearly meant to say LIFT.Overall the presentations could use a good proofing-- I mean this is coming from Columbia University. Several slides have typos and even outright error or wrong word choices.  ""venerable"" instead of vulnerable- Worker Safer? when it should have been safety. FOR used when the intention was FROM, several places in the document. What are the ""really"" choices?  REALLY? obviously real was the correct word.  Sorry but it simply seemed sloppy, and generally I was disappointed in the overall course. ",0,0,WILLIAM MADDEN,94509522
32905091~COURSE!~DlTNoETdEeiajA5pPRmC1g,1613789149862,3,0,"  Good information, but fragmented presentation. The speaker, pop-up questions, and discussion questions often refer to discussions that either haven't happened yet or simply don't exist in the course. Also, you should probably find a companion book to flesh out some of the ideas in this course, because the content is very high level. ",0,0,Aaron Allensworth,32905091

I wish that there was greater opportunity for critical engagement, because I found some of the beliefs presented to be biased yet present",0,1,Caroline Roddey,70413576

However, some of the quiz questions are unclear and occasionally do not reflect the content discussed in the course. Discussions are not very critical, I would have liked to have a greater centering of marginalised communities.
