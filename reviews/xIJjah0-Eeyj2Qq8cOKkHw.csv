24914678~COURSE!~xIJjah0-Eeyj2Qq8cOKkHw,1675001336315,2,0,"I really don't like this course, I was waiting a lot more of it, this is hard to say because I love the course 2 and 3 from this specialization, they were one of the best courses that I take on coursera.Pros: Demonstration of nice tools on week 1 & 2, week 4 give a good notion of argparse and click libraryCon:  Week 1 and 2 could be just one week, two weeks is too much for this amount of content. Week 3 is just not good, but someone already expressed their disappointment in the comments, I just agree. it seems more like the beginning of a specialization than the end of one. I was waiting at least a great final project to work on.",0,0,Danilo Brito Rocha,24914678

They are tyring to teach a lot, but time is short, and lecture environment is too poor. I took other courses, about Statistics using R, and Java course. Both courses narrow lecture target well and include homework projects. Just watching how an instructor do CI/CD stuff was too boring.",0,0,Hong June Park,68651419
