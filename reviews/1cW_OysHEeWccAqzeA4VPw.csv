Though I think it's helpful to know how ADHD is diagnosed, and the defining characteristics, I'm not sure if 2/4 weeks needed to cover these areas. I suppose it's good information to have, if you are unfamiliar with ADHD, or are new to the classroom. I found Week 3 the most helpful -- this was the module focusing on Daily Report Cards. Week 4 was targeted towards parents, but the strateies discussed in this module could certainly be applied to classroom use. Overall, the course was a pretty basic introduction to working with students with ADHD. At times, it seemed to be directed towards educators, and at other times, it was directed towards parents.

Your course is a valuable resourse for teachers who will have to cope with a rise in this problem in the future. In the meantime, if parents have the resources themselves,  I recommend homeschooling until the school system is redesigned to be more copacetic to the children of the future.
