The first problem is that the content of the course  needs to be updated. The second problem (the most serious problem) is the desperate Peer Review Assignment mechanism. Personally, I studied (A LOT!) and completed my assignment, but I had to wait for two weeks or even longer for the feedback grades of my assignment from the peer review, which directly affected the time when I could obtain the certificate. In addition, someone gave me a score of less than 80 points (which means FAIL) plus the comment ""Your assignment is excellent!"" Ironic right? I have no other way to update my grades except waiting for other students to regrade. If you do not have 2 friends who can study this course with you, good luck!",0,0,Sibyl Guo,15126206

The forum reminds me of trade where learners offer points for points. I completed all the assignments required much in advance and didn't have a single grade. This means that even doing my part on time I didn't keep the deadline.  It's frustrating as I chose the paid option with a certificate and I can't even count on feedback and my certificate is on hold. I​f you only need a quick revision I highly recommend it.

It is very clearly and thoughtfully presented, and I found that the length of each of the lectures was of an appropriate length for a part time course, as was the overall amount of work. My only issue relates to the peer-reviewed assignments. The explanations of these assignments leave much to be desired, and are quite unclear in their directions (especially related to precisely what needs to be submitted). I also did not really gain very much from the feedback received, as the marking schemes for these assignments are very vague (I don't think ""effort"" should be an important indicator after Kindergarten!). You are also asking people to provide feedback and marks on something that they have only just completed themselves, with widely varying degrees of understanding. If these peer reviewed assignments were replaced with something else, then I absolutely would have given this course 5 stars. ",0,1,Ian Parsons,50372352

I am an expert in organizational change but this is not (yet) my industry. However, I am now well-equipped with a clearer understanding of the institutional and community/donor/audience considerations within the arts/performance and management/administration landscape.  There were 4 considerable assignments to complete and 2 quizzes. I elected to put a substantive effort in to the course (spent 3-4 hours on each assignment because I want this to build my ""professional portfolio"", an additional 2-3 hours per week on reading, viewing videos).  Completely worth it. I also find Russell and Peter (the faculty) to be thoughtful, knowledgeable and relatable. Highly recommend! ",0,3,Sabrina Pasztor,82759055
