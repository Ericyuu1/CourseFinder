Every woman regardless of where they reside on this earth should take this course.  As a mother of five, I realized after taking this course, it's luck, the country of residence and the grace of God that I am standing here.  This course has given me a wealth of knowledge.  As I went through the course, I would say to myself, ""this is crazy!  How did I not know this."" You don't know what you don't know!""  Just knowing what to look for and understanding when you and your baby are at risk and in need of help saves lives.  I greatly appreciated the course's focus on supporting mothers,  and empowering them to understand how to advocate for themselves.  It is so critical for birthing women to know what procedures/support  is most effective to bring forth life when in labor. In addition, childbirth is a traumatic, physically and emotionally.  Too often, women and those around them do not allow the time to care for themselves, to rest and to allow their bodies to heal.     Thank you to all who made this course possible.  I will be raving about it!",0,0,Bernadette Baptiste-Hageman,42458913

It explains clearly the importance of shifting from a patriarchal attitude toward women's health care (and by extension, women's bodies).  It outlines the problems, needs, resources, and solutions.  It offers answers, not just describes problems.  It is heavy on lecture, but the lectures are good.
