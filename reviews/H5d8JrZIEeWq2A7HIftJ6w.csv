11984742~COURSE!~H5d8JrZIEeWq2A7HIftJ6w,1662641981768,2,0,"O​nly a person talking to a camera does not provide a great experience for modern education platforms about cutting edge technologies. I expected videos with live examples, tutorials on how to manage printing problems and things like that. The course content is rather old, also, by the way, and mostly has not been updated, but commented as recommended software is no longer available. No open source software is recommended, but mostly autodesk partially free alternatives. The course, with all, still remains useful. This is the worst course of the specialization, in my opinion, because of the mentioend reasons.",0,0,Santiago Maraggi,11984742
96738751~COURSE!~H5d8JrZIEeWq2A7HIftJ6w,1654022517756,2,0,"So far the worst course I have experienced on Coursera. The lectures are hard to listen to because of the monotone. There also needs to be more demonstrations instead of just talking. I only made it through 2 weeks of the course.   When I turned in my second peer review assignment, my first still had not been graded yet. I think it is because not enough people are taking the course.  I have learned more from Youtube videos and a book. Unless this course is revised and improved, do not bother taking this course. ",0,0,Janelle Jaeger,96738751

88621959~COURSE!~H5d8JrZIEeWq2A7HIftJ6w,1627223938730,2,0,"(Have years of experience, taking course only for the certification) TL;DR - unprofessional, better go on Youtube. While I can't say this course is false advertising and bad - it's not good. Far from it, knowing to what you get for free from famous Youtube channels. Not professional at all. The overwhelmingly positive reviews are not to be trusted. I'll forgive the lessons that are no more than monotonic reading of a script and slightly outdated content. But the general content and execution is very poor. Not enough visual examples on critical things - at one point the lecturer says ""here are some visual examples"" and literally gives none. At another point he literally uses hand gestures to demonstrate endstops instead of including a diagram / video. This is blatantly unprofessional! These are courses with the name of a university about engineering-level machines and the lecturer uses hand signs! My personal gripe - the content of the lectures is too poetical about technical things. There's a lot of unnecessary allegories for a very tech subject and in some cases, the way he describes things - in 10 years I haven't heard anyone in the desktop 3D printing world use such terms. Finally, what disappointed me a lot was that the course promises to teach you how to maintain and repair a 3D printer but there are NO SUCH LESSONS and in the short troubleshooting video the lecturer literally tells you to go online on manufacturer website or on social media groups... woopty-do! Sorry guys, it's harsh, but this course needs a rework if you're going to put a university name next to it.",0,1,Arturas Pagalys,88621959
39055765~COURSE!~H5d8JrZIEeWq2A7HIftJ6w,1598622813660,2,0,It should be mentioned that coursera no longer offers the 3D Printing Specialization from UoI. I accomplished all of the courses only to find out that this title was no longer available.,0,2,Santiago Sánchez,39055765
42700899~COURSE!~H5d8JrZIEeWq2A7HIftJ6w,1597648394389,2,0,"To be honest, it was really hard to find motivation and enthusiasm to complete this course. Not only the videos were quite dull with simple narrative explanations (i.e. I could've read myself a book for the same result) and few or little animations, videos etc... but there was clear missing or poor editing in several videos: missing parts, repetitions, etc...Definitely not at the same quality standard of other Coursera courses or courses of the same specialization... wait! This is part of a set of 5 courses which don't lead to a specialization: another point which could be improved.",0,2,Francesco Fumarola,42700899
48016453~COURSE!~H5d8JrZIEeWq2A7HIftJ6w,1585094492193,2,0,"Many of the videos from week 4 on are missing demonstrations of the programs.  This was brought up in some of the forums and the Coursera administrators were looking into it.  The videos hint at demonstrating the slicer software but no demonstrations are shown.  The same goes for the video describing model placement and support.  The video doesn't demonstrate anything, and the homework assignment is based on the missing demonstration.  Once the instructer's fix the course and include the missing portions of the videos it might be worth taking.",0,3,Mark Ende,48016453

The reason I'm giving 3 stars is because of two things:1) Throughout the whole 3D printing course specialization, the thing that bothers me the most is the long wait to get assignments peer reviewed. It's taking days to get one assignment graded. The organizers of the course should definitely fix this problem.2) In this course particularly, the transcripts (subtitles) of the video lectures were full of mistakes.
