26624596~COURSE!~tn8lP4fjEeWQhRJp8aTWZQ,1659946917639,3,0,"The content of the course is brilliant and touches upon various nanomaterials, synthesis/fabrication processes and sensing applications.But the presentation style is poor. The slides are more like handouts and the speaking style is like a speech read out of a pre-written text. There is no use of the pointer or careful delivery which matches with each plot shown in the slide. I found it difficult to follow and connect speech to slide contents. All these results in boring and an arduous task to finish lectures with poor retention. The references are missing serial and page numbers which makes it difficult to find them online.
