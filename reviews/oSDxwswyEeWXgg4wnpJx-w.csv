It's heavy for the non-mathmetician, but you just have to struggle to keep up when the going gets numerically tough. My one gripe is that it leans too far towards formulas, and not enough to real-world examples and application. For example, in Week 6 admist the equations, there was suddenly a look at how it applies to drop-out rates in the labour market. That was all too brief, and more of this would really lift the course.
