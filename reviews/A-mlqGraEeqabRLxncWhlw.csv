13381359~COURSE!~A-mlqGraEeqabRLxncWhlw,1604853382063,3,0,"Not really a course for beginners looking to understand ML.  Overall, the course provides a good overview of ML in healthcare, but when it comes to actually explaining ML, it is more of a quick review.   Lectures have far too much unexplained jargon and tend to talk around or gloss over key concepts. Lectures in weeks 2-4 were oddly repetitive and lacked a logical step by step flow.  Instructors also read the script too fast at times.  If they slowed down, spent an extra minute or two to explain the underlying ideas, it would have made a big difference.  Correcting errors in the slides and providing more coursework would help too.  For beginners looking for better non-technical explanations of AI/ML I'd highly recommend looking up Professors Andrew Ng and Melanie Mitchell.    ",0,5,Derek Eng,13381359

I have background already in ML and it helped me reinforce concepts as well as learn an overall point of view of health related benefits, opportunities, use cases, challenges and risks. Very valuable information for an introductory course.However, for people completely new to ML, I think it could be challenging to follow all the concepts that are presented. Coding is not required nor deep math; in fact, instructors do a great work trying to abstract the details in order to explain the concepts. But in ML, some of the topics require more depth and background in order to be able to fully grasp the idea. So if this is your case, it could be good to get some extra content from elsewhere on the basics before or during the course.",0,0,Marcelo Martinez Conti,72494343
