I like her story time session when she shared a real-life example of something that was related to our studies that week.  The 10 second brain break helped me a lot!  I stopped the video very frequently and took good notes on the material and passed with a final grade of 100%.  Dr. Kabiri and her teaching methods had a lot to do with this!
