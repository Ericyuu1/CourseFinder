David Robinson, who handles the ""meat"" of the course in weeks 3 and 4 was absolutely dreadful in every respect that matters in a mastery-oriented online course (in which there is no peer community with which to collectively cover for poor instruction). Specifically, Robinson talks around examples without working through any of them. He did not work through any of the key examples or formulae in Week 3, which is where most of the key concepts of startup valuation are introduced. Basically said, ""go figure it out yourself.""  Other examples: the “hurdle rate” is introduced without adequate definition or an example of how to use given information in the calculation, and Robinson uses this term interchangeably with ""cash-on-cash returns"" (incorrectly) including in equations, which are wrong as presented.  On a quiz for the fourth week on Anti-Dilution presents a question without reference to a specific scenario, so it is impossible to complete without guessing. On the third attempt I just guessed, but there was no reference to a cost scenario to support this guess. Neither the lectures nor the ungraded quizzes cover methods of calculating dilution in initial valuation decisions, but the graded quiz does, leading one to guess (again) where this is dealt with.

72358322~COURSE!~25trttO0Eei47RIrue0xzg,1620939911105,4,0,"VC valuation methods, financing mechanisms, capital providers and security analysis is fairly unique as far as valuation content goes.  The course covers a lot of ground at a high level.  The lectures manage to be brief yet informative.  That said, there is some room for improvement.  For instance, (perhaps because of brevity) the presentation slides gloss over some of the calculations required to build to the correct final solution of a given problem.  You either have to know the ""missing"" steps in advance, reverse engineer them (in excel) or search out for help in the discussion forum.  There are also inconsistencies in the significant figures used in the calculations in the slides and the corresponding lecture video content that can cause learners doubt as to the accuracy of their calculations (e.g. Week 3 option pool slides).  Here again, you have to go into the discussion forum to confirm this is the case.  Lastly, relating to the graded quizzes: this course gives you one chance to pass every 24 hours.  This compares to the typical three attempts per 24 hours in most other Coursera courses.  Given that these tests typically contain several multistep computational problems (often solved with help of Excel in my case), learners might easily lose momentum if they fail and have to wait 24 hours to work through and/or fix their problems.  Though I didn't fail any of the time restricted tests, there were some problems I got wrong and didn't bother to retest where I would have if say I only was timed out for say a few hours.
