39068345~COURSE!~Q2u0W--MEeWj_AqhReL55Q,1633042346264,1,0,"learning objective is not clear. quizzes do not test course knowledge. few mistakes and misleading info in the videoit could have been explained in better ways, and simpler forms. the course raises ambiguity rather than explanation.  Making managerial account a boring field. for students that are new to managerial accounting, they are not going to love it, nothing lively about the way its explained",0,1,Yousra Atmen,39068345

11152927~COURSE!~Q2u0W--MEeWj_AqhReL55Q,1472430310955,1,0,"  My course 3/4 in this specialization is still incomplete because the questions had wrong answers in the module quizzes and it was literally taking HOURS to complete the quizzes because you had to guess which one of the wrong answers would be correct this time. The questions rotate through slightly different questions each attempt so you can't simply use elimination on each attempt, YOU GUESS EVERY SINGLE TIME. IT'S LITERALLY 100% LUCK! I thought maybe course 4/4 would be better but nope, same problems here. I've wasted over 6 hours in total trying to pass these broken tests and I'm completely over it. I also reached out to chat support, they went through and said they couldn't find anything wrong and couldn't help me and a refund was impossible because it's past the refund date. Even though I paid for 2 broken, un-proofread, time wasting courses. Also, in course 4/4, the math tables in the videos are staggered all over the place and looks terrible. Seriously an issue of someone not even looking at the video before publishing, would have taken less than 5 mins to fix for the entire course. Also, every time a ""checkpoint"" question is supposed to pop up, nothing happens. In every single video, they're all missing. I've used Coursera for a few other courses and thought they were reliable but this makes me think otherwise and I feel like such an idiot for paying $200 for this COMPLETE GARBAGE. Other people in the forums have shown they have the same problem posted over a month ago but nothing. Please, someone from Coursera get a hold of me and help me resolve this ridiculous problem.

37432403~COURSE!~Q2u0W--MEeWj_AqhReL55Q,1605853683876,2,0, The course is good for getting to know about the internal decision and strategy making and accounting processes for any company; but the course quizzes has many incorrect answers which have been reported in the discussion forums but still remain erroneous. The explanation has not been upto the mark as compared to the first 2 courses in the specialization cause earlier they actually consulted real business people to portray the concepts of accounting in a lay man's terms which is quite easier for the students to grasp; in this course the faculty just used a tele-prompter or just read through the presentations. This course can be a lot better than it is now.  ,0,3,Sanskar Vidyarthi,37432403
7621079~COURSE!~Q2u0W--MEeWj_AqhReL55Q,1598020157906,2,0,"There are many problems with this course: 1- There is a lacking quality control. In many lessons the team wouldn't trouble to make a presentation were the numbers were aligned. That's too obvious to miss and to simple to correct. The fact that it was not done give me the impression that the class was done without the proper care.2- In some videos the teacher says the same thing in sequence, which means no one bothered to edit the material.3- The quantitative quizzes are more of a guessing experience than a learning experience, since you do not have proper feedback when you make some mistake some answers are clearly wrong as many have informed in the forums for years now and no one bothered to correct it.Don't wast your time and money here, you will only get frustrated.

For example, I reviewed several assignments and found them lacking - basically the work did not follow directions, was obviously done without any effort or was incomplete. I followed the instructions and provided a thoughtful submission, and someone gave me a zero, and now it is unclear whether I have to take the whole class, even though my overall grade was over 90%",0,2,Brian Siegel,51581514
