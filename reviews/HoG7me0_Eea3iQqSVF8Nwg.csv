89749835~COURSE!~HoG7me0_Eea3iQqSVF8Nwg,1637604187588,5,0,"I liked it a lot; the way the case studies and presentations, supported by the analysis made by the professor in the diagrams, greatly facilitated the understanding of the models and their practical application for the design of effective health interventions. In addition, it was fascinating to identify all the factors that influence people's decisions and behaviors about health actions and the way in which we can orient a positive response to the interventions and actions that we can include as reinforcement of the desired behavior change. It will be very useful in my next designing and planning a health intervention",0,0,Elvira Espinosa Gutiérrez,89749835
