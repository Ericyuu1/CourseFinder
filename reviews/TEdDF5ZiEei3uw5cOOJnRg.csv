For example, there was no mention that debriefing in healthcare simulation had roots in search and rescue operations until I missed checking that as one of the correct options. Also, there were occasional quiz questions wherein the accepted answer went directly in opposition to what was presented in the learning.

And in some cases, inferring the accepted answer to a quiz question meant being able to think exactly like the test writer, since the questions are worded in a way that is not close to the way the information was originally presented, and in some cases, not obviously derived from the information as it was presented.

Also, some of the links point to external resources that are no longer accessible / valid.

The delivery was also overly focused on direct lecture (even the note-taking snapshot feature would capture a photo of the speaker that was larger than the actual relevant content being captured - as though their photo taking up half the note page was essential). I was additionally quite disappointed to find numerous typos - including simple word-choice errors (e.g. 'effect' vs. 'affect') - in the written content. The quiz questions were also poorly written, rife with typos, and in a few cases the ""correct"" responses were at odds with the content they were intended to evaluate.

The entire lesson can be downloaded and reviewed to help with retention and with answering assessment questions.  I recommend this course to anyone involved in medical simulation.,0,2,Gail Burleson,43411260

'Simulation' is a word that is used but sometimes I think we who use the word don't all mean the same thing.  This presentation is an attempt at standardizing the conversation surrounding simulation in healthcare.  Very helpful!  Please keep it updated and available.  I am using it with my faculty.  I am sad to see the expiration date of January 2020.  Thank you. ,0,0,Theresa Bucy,43415100
