3756340~COURSE!~lHabnht2EeWo5g5SXpDA8Q,1595296466713,2,0,This course is a brief overview of poetry. For that it is fine. The lessons are extremely brief and it takes very little time to get through this course. The problem with taking a workshop online and in this setting is that you rarely get valuable feedback as a large percentage of your classmates will have very little to say about your poem. Many take an approach of I need to do these two peer workshops to get a grade and breeze right through it. Another negative I have with the course is it never allows you to workshop a poem that is not derived from a prompt in a lesson and many of these prompts are extremely forced. If you are someone who is already writing poems I doubt this is the course for you. My advice is to seek out people in the discussion forum who seem to know what they're talking about and start a correspondence with them. You will get better feedback and can workshop things outside of silly prompts. I apologize if this came off as pretentious. I spent at least 30 minutes with every poem I was asked to workshop. 2 out of 3 submissions my workshop feedback was one sentence long. I got one valuable piece of advice from 3 workshops.,0,1,Keegan O'Neil,3756340

But my chief complaint is the terrible method (in creative writing classes only ?) of using peer reviews to pass the class. I had a non-English-speaking person NOT pass me,  a former English teacher, for no other reason than he misread the assignment. So I had to resubmit. I don't know who finally passed me, I think the peer review process is a shambles, and it lets Coursera personnel out of the process of doing grading and opens a can of worms with an incompetent peer reviewer having the power to not pass me. I don't think I will be taking creative writing classes again at Coursera, as going through that broken peer review process and having one mentor being off the wall just wasn't worth my time and anxiety.",0,13,Bob May,20499191

That said, the peer review system was a bit disappointing; it is important for people considering this class to understand that your workshop poems are ONLY reviewed by other people taking the class at the same time as you, so you are basically at their mercy. I appreciated most of the feedback I got, but I did have one peer reviewer who just wrote ""nothing"" in every single space where a written comment was required. This was a bit annoying since I had worked quite hard on the feedback that I provided for her!I also must join the (many, many) other reviewers who have commented on the antics and silly energy of the instructor.

I gave writing in iambs a try and think that I should practice more as routine. I have peer reviewed before and have found it helpful in revision. In this community, I'm not sure that all of its participants were familiar enough with poetics to closely review a poem.

32326709~COURSE!~lHabnht2EeWo5g5SXpDA8Q,1597279162144,5,0,"With the first video, I didn't feel so interested because
the professor appeared to act like a comedian. His exaggerated manner brought
me distaste a little bit at first. But gradually, I became more familiar with
his style and the overall vibe, and sometimes I did find his acting quite funny.
I think it works fine, because although poetry is art, talking about the techniques,
the jargon and all those revision strategies can be pretty dry. The professor
made the lectures more lively in deed. However, his sense of humor may not work
for everyone.What I like best about the course is that the whole course
is well structured and the content is well organized/ paced throughout the
videos in each week. It was very easy for me to follow and synthesize what I
had learned. The professor’s speech is rich but clear and to the point. I
learned a lot but at the same time didn’t feel overwhelmed. In general, the course takes learners through all the phases
necessary to create a poem. From my experience, I would say if you decide to
take it, make sure you are willing to spend time on(1) contemplating during/after watching the videos. The
knowledge from this course is not x+y=z; it needs time to analyze, synthesize
and reflect.(2) reading the extra materials. The materials are suggested
in the course. You may need to read more in order to understand further or be
able to respond to the writing prompts. But don’t worry; they are not lengthy articles
or another 30-min video. For example, glossary, poem collections, wikipedia...(3) doing the peer review in a diligent and fair manner. I
had received reviews of 15-20 words including “I think you did a good job” or “this
is not a lipogram” – very general and not helpful. Another time, I received the
review which was supposed to be for another poem. It was a mistake or the
reviewer just copied and pasted - I don’t know, but it was frustrating. Together,
let’s create a helpful community with reciprocity: I give you quality constructive
feedback and you do the same to me.",0,0,JC Nguyen,32326709

The animated professor made me smirk and chuckle at his style of teaching. I truly felt like a child again which made it more appealing to go in and continue through the lessons each day. My writing has increased in rhythm and appeal to readers/listeners because of this course. I advanced as I could through the course which was a wise move due to the final assignment giving me a hard time to create something I'd be proud of. I took my time revisiting it slowly (day by day on one assignment), having so much time left over before the course's end date.

37407619~COURSE!~lHabnht2EeWo5g5SXpDA8Q,1546697584939,5,0,"What a great course!  At first, wanting to keep true to my own style, I started with much trepidation but, right from the beginning, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  The whole process expanded my awareness and, rather than putting me in a straitjacket of style and substance, it expanded my horizons, sometimes with prompts that seemed totally impossible; particularly daunting were the lipogram, cinquain and Alexandrine, and yet the poems flowed.  This was a big revelation for me, as well as very exciting.I’m still surprised that I wrote many poems of which I’m so very proud, often working on both prompts.  The course moved me out of my comfort zone: for instance, with ‘The Table-Top Pencil Sharpener’, which was supposed to be pure image, but wouldn’t behave, and wrote itself anyway.  I would never have written a poem on this subject before, and yet it emerged.  Writing something so different on a subject so seemingly mundane, really cemented in my mind the possibility of writing poetry about anything, whilst filtering it through perception and imagination.Another aspect of the course that stands out for me are the peer reviews: both giving and receiving.  I was very lucky to have reviewed some fantastic poems, and most of the reviews I received were thoughtful and productive.  Going to try to use the comments box, now, to thank those who took the time to really consider the poems and their comments.The moderators were excellent, helping out with both technical aspects of the course and comments on poems.  There were some technical and navigational aspects of the website I struggled with: finding peer reviews, and lack of reviewers at certain times so having to reset deadlines, but the moderators stepped in very quickly.Even though the course has finished, I will still tackle some of the prompts not completed within the timeframe, due to deadlines (or as someone on the forums endearingly termed them - ‘deathlines’!)  The ‘conceit’, for one, and an already started new poem, using rhyme originally penned by a famous poet.Thank you for a concise yet truly inspirational course.
