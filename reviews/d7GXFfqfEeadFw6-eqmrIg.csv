It would be nice if there was some discussion about what shell scripts were actually used for out in the world. The cloud computing section seems tacked on and wholly unhelpful. Don't make your students give their credit card numbers to some external business unless you're going to do something of at least some lasting value.

I've never experienced this on Coursera before, the 4 videos that do exist aren't useful in any way.-The is some introductory, and unnecessary, introduction to both cloud computing and ssh / scp commands. I'm not really sure why it's there, when all of the assignments focus on both git and bash. So anything you did learn in these sections (likely nothing) isn't reinforced. It should be bonus material.-Many things about bash are truly unusual compared to other programming languages like python/r/php/etc. When these differences crop up (such as how bash handles (), {}, [], [[ ]], spaces, AND, ||, functional returns, etc) are still somewhat confusing to me after completing the entire course. So maybe I'm a dummy, but I'm guessing MOST people completing this course will only be slightly better off doing bash programming vs. doing nothing at all. -Quizzes were often trivially easy. What will a bash command output? Well, I guess you're not *supposed* to just run the command in bash to see the output...I could go on, but honestly, this is a terrible course.

59468201~COURSE!~d7GXFfqfEeadFw6-eqmrIg,1593929787686,3,0,"Full disclosure:  I am a self-trained Linux user, and have been using Linux as my main OS for more than 10 years.  The main reason I tried (and eventually purchased) this course was that I needed a certificate to ""prove"" my knowledge of the terminal for *official* reasons (employment etc) and a Coursera certificate was suggested as a solution.  Furthermore, I thought that some of the material seemed interesting and that I may also learn something new.Overall, the course was acceptable.  Most of the material, especially the terminal basics and bash programming segments, was laid out in a comprehensive manner.  Although, to be honest, more could have been done in the introductory section (for example, a discussion on root vs non-root access, the purposes of superusers and sudo etc.  This is one of the most important parts of Linux).The Git/GitHub material was especially welcome since, for whatever reason, I had never used it before.  This was the most useful part of the course for me.So, why the 3 stars then, instead of 4 or 5?The weakest point of this course is the final part, the so called ""Nephology"" segment that, supposedly, deals with ""cloud computing"":I find the fact that the course requires/instructs you to open an account in a commercial Cloud infrastructure (DigitalOcean) and purchase a VM unacceptable (despite what the course says about a free trial, D.Ocean wants to conduct a 25 dollar transaction during registration ""for confirmation purposes"").  There are a number of respectable Cloud infrastructures out there that actually offer free of charge resources (Red Hat's OpenShift, Google cloud etc) and could have been used instead.  Or, since this course is offered by a University, maybe they could have allocated a fraction of their compute resources to set up a small VM server for the purposes of this course.Even if we gloss over the aforementioned fact, the presentation of the ""nephology"" course itself was subpar.  It was simply a poorly conceived introduction to the ssh protocol and cron jobs.  No other relevant protocols were discussed (for example, ftp/sftp - it's not anything advanced, and its the most widely used file transfer protocol) and - more importantly - no discussion was presented on security and how to (you know... the first 's' in 'ssh' and 'sftp'). For example, the fact that they instruct you to create ssh connections as root says it all.  Advice to anyone reading this: NEVER, ever, EVER login as root.  SSH may have 'secure' in its name, but it's not really that secure.  Do it only once, create a normal user account with 'useradd' and give it sudoers credentials with 'visudo', and use that account onwards. NEVER perform ssh connections as root!!!!So, overall, acceptable course, but the Nephology part needs to either be re-written from scratch and include more - and critically useful - material, or be removed altogether.",0,9,Fotis Baltoumas,59468201
