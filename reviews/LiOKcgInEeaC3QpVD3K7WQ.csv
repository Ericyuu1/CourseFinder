I have been really frustrated I started this course submitted two different assignments and never passed, I re-enrolled recently, so meaning I have paid twice for this course, submitted a new essay and yet have not been able to pass. There is no way to contact with the teachers of the course and honestly I don't think it should be left on the hands of other people than the ones to provide the course to qualify the last assignment which is the one that defines if you pass the whole program or not. Coursera also has not available email to reply for inquiries like this one, if you want an answer from them they just put you through an endless cycle of reading small articles regarding possible ways to improve your exposure of this type of assignments. Without ever giving you a proper answer or a direct channel to talk to them. Which makes me think this is quiet shady and they must receive lots of complains so their strategy is to hide.

That is, how to deal with environmental issues perceived as externalities by the existing strategic paradigm. Sustainability is a different paradigm, a different mental model, and a different worldview leading to a different strategic logic. On the basis of this course being labelled as strategic, I was hoping it would to address the corporate level strategic challenge of how business can transition from one mental model to another mental model.The course should be renamed so as not to confuse prospective students wanting to understand corporate level business strategy and sustainability.

The various historical examples gave points of reference for policy and helped one understand the material.  One major concern I have with the course was the professors dramatic shift in tone when discussing advocates vs. activists.  He defines activists as having no academic, legal, or genuine intellectual understanding of policy and purely becoming engaged for personally beliefs.    Greenpeace is used as an example,  and a story in which activists caused economic harm and physically threatened the safety of workers in his further explaining the negative impact and ineffectiveness of activists.    In his attempt to create a course structure and define effectiveness of certain groups the professor instead creates a negative false archetype and in the process immediately lost any credibility with me.   After that point in the course I doubted the validity and understood everything was more based on the opinion of the professor than industry accepted/embraced understanding.
