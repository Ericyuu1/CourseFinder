The actors doing patients were so real, we also got to see the physician patient interaction. I was able to follow along because I understand German (the subtitles were not synchronized), which might be troublesome for those who rely only on the script. Some lectures were very hard to follow, when the instructor was just reading the text shown. More pictures and showing him while explaining would definitely be more engaging for learners.
