25516397~COURSE!~puX6UjszEeeaawqep_smgg,1638244706807,1,0,"Honestly, I didn't like it all. I thought it was related to translation, it turns out it has nothing to do with it, yet it uses the name of it. Also turns out that I studied science - biology - human health & associated many years ago, and even it relating to it, the videos are too long and boring in my opinion. Yet, the first point is, there is no meaning in using a name correlated to translation if the course has nothing to do with it. This term is just a subjective approach of the objectives of research, and not an official subject in the scientific domain.",0,0,Bruna Bonatto,25516397

36318152~COURSE!~puX6UjszEeeaawqep_smgg,1540204203800,2,0,"The content of the videos is very short and consists mostly in interviews with researchers in various areas who even though are indeed indirectly part of the translational process (like we all are somehow) have little to do with its general spirit. The same can be said about the papers that must be read in order to complete the course : only few of them are really about translational science, while most of them are just about the current research of one of the interviewers and I can't help but feel these papers were mostly included for advertising purposes. In short, this course didn't bring me much at all and I find it particularly daring to ask 50 dollars in exchange for a proof of completion and for the quiz correction whose questions are honestly so easy that most people with the slightest link with research would succeed in them without watching the videos. Therefore, I would not recommend this course, unless you are a complete beginner in research or your background has nothing to do with science or medicine.",0,3,Thomas Baumgartner,36318152

65400598~COURSE!~puX6UjszEeeaawqep_smgg,1595389540476,4,0,"The course is short which I liked. The interviews with various researchers could be cut down or could be better labelled as to where they fit within the T0-T4 spectrum (why we are being shown them), but they are generally interesting. I think it would be better to focus on clinical trials classification which are more precisely fit into levels or to ask the students more thought provoking questions which focus on translational science. Some of the interviews feel like they are just showing off the research at Rochester and most of the papers you're asked to read are not really relevant or are overkill. I do think I learned something from this. I had access to this course for free through my school.",0,0,Christina Hendren,65400598

It was useful for me as I am about to begin a Master's Degree in Clinical Investigation, and that is a topic widely talked about in the course. For people who are already enrolled in a science area it will be a very easy-to-catch course, and even if you are not, it is not a difficult subject. The papers and publications provided were actually very usefull, and the fact that so many different researchers and professionals talk about their experiences and how they got to begin in the field is very helpful. However, I would only recommend this course if you want some easy-to-learn basic knowledge about this theme, because if you look for some more profound knowledge you would probably have to find a less introductory class, but overall I found it very interesting and well constructed.",0,0,Beatriz Maria Vargas Ricardo,79757521

The information about the mechanics of translational science centres and the various programmes for physician-scientists was also really elucidating. One of the best Coursera courses I've done.
