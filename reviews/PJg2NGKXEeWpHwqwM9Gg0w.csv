10890924~COURSE!~PJg2NGKXEeWpHwqwM9Gg0w,1458051418035,1,0,"Some of this content is glaringly wrong e.g that F Roosevelt's freedoms weren't seen by him as inalienable rights, that culture and education were attributes of Eleanor's approach to freedom  that were distinctive from FDR.

760302~COURSE!~PJg2NGKXEeWpHwqwM9Gg0w,1460603157607,2,0,"The lectures are too brief and do not go into details pertinent to the main theses  of the course.  While it is evident that each of the Roosevelts had a significant impact on their respective time in history, saying that it was a Rooseveltian century is going a bit too far.  Nearly all the reforms that they initiated were countered by the end of the 20th century.  Wagner-Pyser, Glass-Steagall were gutted by the end of the century and as for the UN we all know how in ineffective that has been at protecting human rights.  The only thing that has lasted has been Social Security and that is under attack by a co-opted ultra-conservative  Congres",0,0,Harry Foster,760302

780492~COURSE!~PJg2NGKXEeWpHwqwM9Gg0w,1459263811897,4,0,I enjoyed this class and learned a lot.  The intervening research topics did not seem to be part of the grading for this course and I am not sure if anyone did them after the first one.  The final peer assessment project just asked for a repeat of everything that had been said in the class since the final lecture went all the way up to Obamacare.  There was no room to add anything to what the course had already said.,0,0,Hilde Komoda,780492
