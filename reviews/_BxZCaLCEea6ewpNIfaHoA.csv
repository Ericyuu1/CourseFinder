I would recommend looking at the rubric after you submit and modifying as needed, there are some that are incorrect/you might fail if you aren't careful to match the rubric. One had the wrong numbers (some were randomly rounded up while others weren't and some were wrong all together). In the last assignment it said to do A or B but the rubric marks both seperately and you need both sets of marks to pass. ",0,0,Lisa Fritsch,76014166
58277084~COURSE!~_BxZCaLCEea6ewpNIfaHoA,1597257993547,3,0,"Material is interesting and relevant. Well explained. John is engaging and clear as an instructor. I wish there was a way to ask questions. The discussion board doesn't get much discussion - mostly comments that go there to die hehe. The transcript of the text is so full of mistakes. Sometimes completely different than what is being spoken. The tests are generally quite easy. The assignments are very relevant and practical which is great. However, the details on the instructions page and the submission page sometimes differ or are somewhat unclear. The peer-review is fairly straightforward, however there is no support is the peer who has corrected your assignment misreads your answers and fails you. You have to resubmit and wait, sometimes weeks for someone to finally review your work. Some questions only require you to complete portion (A) or portion (B), for example. However, when comes the time to correct someones work, you have to give points to both sections, which leaves it up to the corrector to give ""free"" points or take away points. This, in turn, can affect the student's final grade. Overall this is a good course that I would recommend. Only a few technical glitch that would require fixing for more stars.",0,0,Jesse-Ann Demanche,58277084
33756958~COURSE!~_BxZCaLCEea6ewpNIfaHoA,1578908246748,3,0,"The course is designed for beginners and has a lot of insightful information about how to start your first sustainability project.  You might find it boring if you have already some experience in sustainability. Additionally, the course contains several errors in the description of the assignments and some information is outdated which makes it difficult to complete the assignments. The tutors are slow in responses or do not give their feedback at all. Additionally, I found the B-Lab assessment is useless and it seems that it's just a promotion of BCorp.It could be interesting to learn about it, but not to spend 45 minutes minimum on completing the questionnaire which nobody cares about. BCorp assessment should be a choice made by a company and not a compulsory test area. These aspects made me decide not to continue the course series. I appreciate enormous work lecturers put into the program but encourage them to devote some time to it on a regular basis. I hope my feedback will be helpful. ",0,3,Kristina Kerbel,33756958
507498~COURSE!~_BxZCaLCEea6ewpNIfaHoA,1652099724421,4,0,"Interesting material in the course itself, but much of the optional reading was from pretty old sources. Those articles could use a refresh. Thanks. ",0,0,Greg Friese,507498
896503~COURSE!~_BxZCaLCEea6ewpNIfaHoA,1639638976142,4,0,"I come from a communications and marketing background with no prior experience in concepts of sustainability, business practice, and accounts. I am in the process of pivoting towards a career in sustainability and climate crisis management. This course is a deep dive into concepts of sustainability (from a planetary + business + citizen perspective of how we consume energy). It then moves on to showcase how businesses can become more successful if they incorporate sustainable energy practices across their vision/mission, operations, recruitment, and community impact areas. 

You do need about 1 - 1.5 hours everyday in order to watch the videos, read the additional articles, assess the information, and then apply the learnings in your assignment and quiz. 

The accounts/calculation and business assessment sections of the course were tough for someone like me with no background in math, finance, economics, however, the explanations and examples really helped understand these sections. 

In the end, the learning experience depends on how much you put into the course. There's not much in terms of community participation, so don't expect an active, engaged group of learners. 

This is a beginner's module in a 4-part course and I would recommend completing the rest of the modules as well. If you are looking to gain internship or entry level work in a company's sustainability department, doing the course will help you get familiar with all the right terminologies, concepts and ways of thinking about sustainability from a business owner's perspective and might get you brownie points at the interview.
