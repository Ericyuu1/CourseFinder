It would be better if the lecturer spend more time explaining formulas for better intuiation instead of letting student memorize them",0,0,Derek Thompson,100001701
40946736~COURSE!~hnz_3UVJEeu5YxIbcwLDzw,1636605264856,4,0,"A good course. Prof. Cutrone is pleasant and easy to follow. My only complaint is that the tests almost always seem to include significant amounts of material that was only briefly covered in the lectures or practice sets. You do get the answers worked out after the test, but I'd rather have slightly more comprehensive lectures that cover some of the more complex material.",0,0,Andrew Walvoord,40946736

93087880~COURSE!~hnz_3UVJEeu5YxIbcwLDzw,1635738221677,5,0,"nice class with professor Joesph, he is a fantastic mathematics professor, as he can translate complex definition of mathematics into simple and clear functions with the same meaning. For me, mathematics is a symbol of convenience and conciseness, so i truly believe that Professor Joseph is a nice teacher, and this is a nice class with topics including extrema for multivariable functions, Lagrange multipliers, tangent lines and tangent planes!

The quizzes are also significantly harder than those in previous courses and could take you more time than expected. Still a great course, would recommend to people who want to learn more advanced calculus. ",0,0,Xinyuan Xing,16393240
