37945525~COURSE!~r8zaNVu-EeW0ugrg2GGh4Q,1638592108766,1,0,"The worst course in motion planning for robotics. Reasons:
Material: Super short videos that don't explain the topics properly.
Assignments: Too complex for the amount of information that they provide. I got stuck in the triangle validation, how I supposed to know this kind of thins in videos that last 3 minutes. The autograder is basically useless, it does not provide any data to debug the code. 
Forums: Basically no info, I took the machine learning course and it was full of test cases, help. In this case all you will find is people complaining.

While the material was on the sparse side, the level of the course was more as advertised.  The Matlab assignments were not too difficult, but were relevant enough to the material to be acceptable.  Some of the assignment simulations/animations were not working, but I was able to submit the results and get full credit.  I was ready to give 2 or 3 stars in this review.Unfortunately, on the last assignment, the sample code and scripts was buggy (even towards the end of the course after it had been pointed out to the staff), and inconsistently written.The final project submit script would not work and it was a trial and error troubleshooting to understand why.  Some on the discussion boards were able to submit, but other couldn't.  Although my assignment would run as I understand the project should, I could not even submit it.  Judging from the discussion boards, I'm not the only one with this problem.Again, the University of Pennsylvania has missed the mark with this class and the robotics series.

Learning A* and Dijkstra's algorithm is great however the assignments require you to learn not just the little details but to ""discovery"" techniques not even mentioned in the course material.  In addition, you must have strong matlab programming skills and be familiar with much matlab functionality in order to debug some of the assignments.  You must have more knowledge concerning matlab than any of the course material or pointers provides.   Meaning that beginners will NOT pass this course.  The automatic grader provides no feedback at all except pass or fail.  This is unfortunate as it can look like your code is working correctly but, the grader is using some edge cases to grade the code but will not include any information indicating what to look for. This is really atrocious. Although the TA's do occasionally provide answers to questions.  The total amount of time TA's spend answering questions is just really poor.  Don't expect even well asked questions to be answered at all.  In addition, the coded template quality upon which your own code depends is horrible and thrown together.  You will spend way too much time analyzing it for clues as  to what went wrong.  Sadly, enough all of these issues have caught up with me and I was unable to pass assignment 2 part 2.  Even, though everything looks like it works and achieves the desired goal and even works with all of my own test cases.  The grader is merciless.  Perhaps, in the feature more time can be devoted to make this course better and I  can spend more time learning how the algorithms and maths work rather than matlab and the automatic grader.  At this time I don't feel like my money was well spent on these courses.   I don't think I would like to risk another 50 dollars learning matlab and debugging the automatic grader on any of the other courses in this specialization.

CJ Taylor is an enthusiastic lecturer and the material was presented in an enjoyable easy to understand way and having finished the course, I definitely want to learn more about computational motion planning. The problems I have with this course though are numerous. This is the second part of the Robotics Specialization and compared to the first part, this course was very weak. There was very little lecture material and the course felt thin - as if it were 2 weeks of material stretched over 4. There were many instances where the lectures could have gone in to much more detail and just didn't, I appreciate that you can't cover everything in lectures, but would it have killed you to provide or at least point to some good additional reading resources?The assessments were the worst part. The quizzes barely tested what I had learnt and could mostly be solved by common sense. What I find shocking is that there were so few questions with few multiple choice answer that you could easily brute-force these quizzes if you really wanted to. Compare this to the Aerial Robotics course where the quizzes took time and forced me to think and understand what was discussed in lecture.The programming assignments were shockingly bad.  They were hard for completely the wrong reasons. I spent most of my time on them not coding the solution, but trying to figure out what was actually wanted and fixing bugs that were in the provided code that we WEREN'T EVEN SUPPOSED TO EDIT. The autograder would never tell you why you were wrong, just ""I'm sorry, your solution didn't pass all of our test cases."" This meant that finding the solution was based on guesswork rather than considered thought. This was made even worse by the fact that some simulations took a long time to run which made iterating guesses very slow - and doing this on a time limit is just pointlessly stressful.One of the assignments had the solution already in the source code as the instructors had forgotten to take it out.The final assignment wouldn't even run out of the box without fixing bugs in the provided code. This would have taken seconds to check had the person who wrote it bothered to check their work beforehand.Thing is, the tasks provided in principle weren't that hard, they were actually kind of too easy. Dijkstra's algorithm isn't that difficult to implement from scratch, and yet all that was asked of us was to implement a small 10 line for-loop. That said, I appreciate that as a software engineer, I might find this sort of thing much easier than most, but even so I don't feel as though the programming assignments helped me learn anything.Overall, regardless of how interesting the material was, this course was very shoddily put together. I appreciate this is the first time the course has been run, but this really felt phoned in and unacceptable. I paid money for this course and the quality of it is notably worse than most free MOOCs I have taken.
