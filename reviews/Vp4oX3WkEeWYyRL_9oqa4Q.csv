But it has problems:First, there are technical issues with the automatic grader (the program that checks the assignments' correctness). Despite the proffessors' sympathy for the Java programming language, the grader uses a very old version of the language. I found that out the hard way after already writing the first programming assignment in Java. I had to spend 2 hours refactoring the newer Java features out of my code. And yet, the grader still didn't accept my submission because it could not find the main file, despite it literally being there! (Problem that was only reported after the Java compiler succssefully parsed all of my refactored code). I ended up giving up on Java and I translated the assignment into Python. This time, I had learned my lesson and I began with a dummy submission that printed the version of the Python language the grader was using to the standard output, which also confirmed that the grader was indeed working properly. At the time of writing this, the version was Python 3.8.6.Second, despite reporting, and posting about, the issues, nothing has been done to address the problem. And this is not ok. The maintainers of a supposedly high quality course such as this should regularly update the programming languages their grader supports to the latest versions, as well as inform the course taker about which versions are currently supported.",0,0,Tudor Jinga,73690322

Even though the course is for beginners don't think you are going to complete it like other beginners courses. It will take a lot more effort. Also, prepare yourself to devote a lot of time to it.

However, I can safely say that both part 2 and part 1 of this course are, without a doubt, the best courses I have taken so far (and the most complex at the same time). 

The course is flawless in terms of content and practice. You learn a lot at a constant pace. But I would like to highlight two characteristics that have been very important for me: 

The first one is the passion that teachers Schocken and Nisan transmit. You can tell that they love teaching, and that they have put a lot of effort into providing the students with the necessary tools to do so. 

The second one is that, finally, after many years, someone has explained to me what a computer is, from the most basic to the most complex. And furthermore, it has not only been theoretical, but has allowed me to experiment with it. For me that is something of incalculable value. 

Many thanks to Professors Schocken and Nisam, and to all those who have collaborated in the realization of this magnificent course.

My three main suggestions for improving this course are; firstly, to shorten the video lecture, as subjects are repeated somewhat throughout the individual videos, secondly, decrease the weekly projects' scope - they are too massive risking to loose the student along the way, thirdly, provide more information from a single source on how to complete projects - information is currently spread throughout video lectures making it difficult to synthesise, while the information provided is too ambiguous.

If you already feel quite comfortable with compilers and operating systems (for instance, you've previously implemented your own compiler from scratch), then maybe it suffices only to take the first part of nand2tetris as a course in computer architecture. If not, then I would highly recommend taking the second part in addition to the first as an introduction to these subjects (part 2 should probably not be taken without part 1 since the software hierarchy developed in part 2, particularly the virtual machine, is designed to run on the specialized architecture introduced in part 1). However, note that part 2 is signficantly more work (at least 2-3 times as much) as part 1. Note also that part 2 requires familiarity with a programming language; if you wish to have your assignments graded by the auto-grader, then this language should come from the list of supported languages. At the time of this writing (September 2019), the auto-grader supports the following languages: C, C++, C#, Elixir, Erlang, Go, Haskell, Java, Lua, Node.js, Perl, PHP, Python 2.7, Python 3, Ruby, Rust, Scala, Swift.One thing to note about this course is that it is not the result of combining ordinary courses on compiler construction and operating systems and many of the standard topics taught in these courses are not touched upon at all. Rather, the nand2tetris philosophy is one of ""learn by doing"". This means that, while the lectures do give very clear explanations of what it is you are trying to accomplish, as well as examples of how parts or cases of your problem can be solved, you ultimately have to come up with your own solutions. In the end, your solutions may not be optimal or very elegant, but you will gain a very confident understanding of the details. I believe this makes nand2tetris part 2 an excellent course to take prior to a formal course on compilers or operatings systems.",0,4,Ben,13253055

42011~COURSE!~Vp4oX3WkEeWYyRL_9oqa4Q,1499450933728,5,0,By far the best MOOC I have taken - the focus on actual projects rather than simple quizzes keeps one continuously challenged.The sense of accomplishment from building the entire stack of computing from ground up is really amazing.The course instructors are great presenters and orators - there's no chance of getting bored - they bring great enthusiasm and passion into what they teach.,0,0,Vivek N,42011
18225700~COURSE!~Vp4oX3WkEeWYyRL_9oqa4Q,1497367142062,5,0,"This course is a lot more demanding in terms of time and effort compared to ""Nand to Tetris Part I."" While Part I took me about a week to complete total, for Part II I actually needed the entire week per unit. They estimate about 10 hours per programming assignment, but I found that to be an underestimate. Unlike in Part I, you are expected to be proficient in a high-level programming language such as Python or Java. A lot of the assignments in Part II are similar to Project 6 in Part I (building the assembler). If you did the programming track for that assignment and enjoyed it, then you're ready for Part II. In the end, I feel like all the effort was worth it, since I greatly improved my programming skills and gained a greater appreciation for what goes on ""under the hood."" ",0,6,Jesse Ward,18225700

I think that the grading interface could be improved (output from the automatic grader), I'm not sure if this has been done already. But, this course is a real gem and definitely helps me understand the inner workings of computers, which is important for me as I come from a pure math background. Thank you!",0,0,victor312,15863069

20747726~COURSE!~Vp4oX3WkEeWYyRL_9oqa4Q,1488091433079,5,0,"The second part of Nand2Tetris is a magical illuminating journey to the inner depths of computer systems including virtual machines, compilers, high level programming and operating systems covering some of the main concepts in computer science such as dynamic memory management, text and graphic representations using input/output devices, math, strings and arrays library implementations...Like the first part of Nand2Tetris it is magnificently taught and I recommend it to anybody who wants to demystify (some of) the magics of computers for themselves.However I should warn you that it requires a great deal of commitment and many hours of study, research and programming each week in order to be able to complete the course; Specifically the high level programming project would require some well thought application/game so you might be able to implement it in Jack High Level Language in time and only in one week.Basic knowledge of a high level programming language like Python or Java is required in order to accomplish the programming tasks of writing an Assembler, a Virtual Machine, a Compiler and also would be helpful when writing the OS in Jack (the native Hack High Level Language).Finally the last two projects (compiler part 2 and OS) are extremely challenging, specially the second part of the compiler in which I literally was crying for help :DExcellent job Prof. Shimon Shocken!",0,7,Mohammad Ghaffari,20747726
