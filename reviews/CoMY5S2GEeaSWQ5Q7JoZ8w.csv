The lecturers are very biased and often manipulate the data ,or even lie about the subject matter, so it will fit their left worldview. (The most prominent lie is the portrayal of the Israeli right as those who want to overthrow the rights of Israeli Arabs.)The subjects in the course are not presented in an honest and balanced way, which is a shame because the course had a lot of potential.

Her tone seemed to be in sympathy of those young citizens who would rather not have to defend the homeland. As a career soldier & retired veteran, I must strongly disagree with that premise. The majority of veterans that I have met feel strongly the need for cumpulsory national service here in the US. Israel's policy of universal national service is greatly respected in this country.In that the geopolitical situation in Israel requires a srong standing military, the requirement for cumpulsory national service  should not be abandoned. The fact that some of the draftees feel either discriminated against  or not utilized to their potential really means nothing in that the military has a heirarchy (chain of command) that must be followed to be effective. New draftees soon turn into new trainees with basic military skills & must prove themselves before they are even promoted thru the rank structure. Their alleged discontent is evidence of their puffed up opinions of themselves.  Eighteen  year olds think they're smart but they really need to be guided thru their formative years.In closing, let me also say that it's a citizen's solemn duty to serve their country the best way that they can.
