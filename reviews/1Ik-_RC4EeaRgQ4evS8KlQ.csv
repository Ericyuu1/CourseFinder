31988377~COURSE!~1Ik-_RC4EeaRgQ4evS8KlQ,1521819349486,3,0,"Week 1 starts off where Course 1 & 2 left off... more lectures without course-directed opportunity to apply the lessons.  Week 1 is lead by guest Instructor Hunter (who led some of the weeks in earlier courses).  He's an expert academic in his field, but without more practical application of principles, limited benefit.Week 2 offers some hands on Tableau practice, which is great.  The Data Quality lecture is a waste and can be skipped, as the instructor just rambles for 18 minutes, and doesn't share any insights that weren't covered in an earlier course.  In summary... make sure the data is clean or clean it up (before bringing it into Tableau).  I thought there'd be some Tableau tips and tricks, but there aren't... (with the exception of maps/locations).Week 3, probably one of the best weekly sessions so far (for those really looking to dig in to Tableau).  The Instructor goes through creating multiple worksheet visualizations, and creating a Dashboard, along with interactive filtering (that has barely been touched on till now).  The most hands on / application to date IMO. The quiz asks questions not covered in this weeks lecture (covered in Week 4).  I felt like I wasn't quite ready to create the Dashboard (the assignment), especially after going through Week 4, where they go in more depth about Story-boarding.  If you're ahead of the game, skip the assignment in Week 3 till you go through Week 4 (much more context and examples to leverage).Week 4, starts out with Hunter sharing too much academia without practical application (as seen in most of my critiques, I find little value in this, but personal preference).  When it switches back to the primary instructor, things improve greatly.  Skip the last lecture... he spends 20 minutes telling you how to take a screen-capture and paste it into PowerPoint...?  The assignment takes what was learned from week 3, and building a story-board, which is great.  I mentioned in week 3 that I struggled with the assignment, as they're essentially asking you to cram a story into one dashboard, so week 4 I unpacked my too-crammed dashboard into different slides (story-points).

The neuroscience and cognitive aspects of visualisation that are covered in courses 1 and 2 suddenly start making sense. Also, the in-depth overview of Tableau that Suk provided in course 3 builds a fine ground to tackle the challenge that this course provides.Building a story really makes you think like an analyst. I felt that I learnt so much from the demonstrative videos, especially on the non-technical aspects of visualisation (and Tableau). You will learn subtle aspects of tweaking that make the visualisation from ""good enough"" to ""inspiring"".Tips: 1. Recommended background reading is aplenty. I would not recommend spending too much time on the research papers as many were far too abstract for my taste. 2. Recommended websites and readings from Tableau are good though, e.g. have a try at Brainpickings. 3. I have not read any of the recommended books, but will consider buying at least one as a reference.4. Do not attempt this course before completing the first 3.

Sometimes the in-video questions are too trivial to be useful (mere repetitions of what has just appeared on the frame before).A general comment on the Specialisation. This is last (4th) course (before the project) of the Specialisation on Data Visualisation on Tableau, I’d expected to see somewhere along the specialisation something deeper about creating complex calculated fields (e.g. explaining the usage of “fixed”, or “window” functions).",0,0,Luca Naso,12244867
