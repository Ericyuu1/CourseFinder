There is ZERO value in anything they provide in these ""Case studies"". Pure and utter bullshit. They are just begging you to hire Accenture or ask you to apply to work at Accenture.I wish there were a lower score than just 1 star. I'd give them a star in minus, for wasting my time.D​on't waste your time!",0,1,Anas Rjab,89060535

I liked the Canal+ TV case, but it is still high level. I wished this class defines more mature process to deal with practical problems.

It is not very in-depth but offers some good ideals if you are particularly interested in some of the industries on how they utilize data anaytics. For me the example of Bank of Ireland and healthcare sectors are the most interesting and inspiring cases.,0,0,carol,667243

You will be exposed to many different domains and see how business analytics can help solving real world problems. I worked for many years on IoT and digital transformation and even while the course is a few years old these case studies are still relevant. That said the course could use a refresher.

The course is mostly stories of real business cases and the application of business analytics. I personally would prefer more R scrips and actual analysis to be done. But the whole specialization in amazing and worth it. I'm really thankful that I could learn from ESSEC and ACCENTURE. I'd give 10/5 for the specialization if I could. ",0,1,Nino Požar,32304535
