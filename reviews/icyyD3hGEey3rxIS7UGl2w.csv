I did not mind doing it but this exercise wasn't clear from the beginning which not only delayed the completion of the course but also lowered the quality of the experience overall. I would have preferred to join a virtual session and be a part of a conversation where we could have discussed everything we read and watched throughout the 4 weeks of sessions. Not very realistic to expect a student to be dedicating all this extra time to write an essay while taking a masters. This would be my only suggestion the course was wonderfully designed and I am glad this is a must in our program!,0,0,Sandra Carrollo,116091746
