Duck-Joo Lee has put together an excellent course. The course tries to achieve something
which, from a spiritual perspective can take many years of dedicated meditation and practice.  However, the method taught in this course is
so simple and straightforward that anyone can do it. With regular practice, it
is definitely possible for anyone to achieve their true potential. In this world of sadness,
suffering and miseries, it is essential that all of us learn such methods and
practice them to bring the happiness and peace which everyone desire and by
birthright are ours. I am very glad that I joined for
this course. I will definitely continue to practice what I learned during the
course. I strongly recommend this course to anyone who wants lasting inner
peace and tranquility.  The course may
seems to be a bit dry initially, but I suggest that you stick on and complete
the course. Regularly and honestly practice the method and then see the magic
happen. Once again, Thank you very much

This was a life changing lecture series for me as I am spending a very critical time period of my life which will decide the future of my life. I went through some pivotal changes in my career, education and social life and it affected me in some negative ways and I kept doubting the decisions I made and keep reminding of all the hardships and bitter moments of my life. After following this lecture series I was able to reflect on those negative thoughts and I realized that all that happened is in the past and I must not relive them in my mind and go through the suffering again and again. Instead now I'm discarding all those memories that keep me grounded and focus more on the present moment and the future. Even though I practiced self reflection meditation as Professor Duck Joo Lee taught I was able to experience the positive effects in my daily life. I feel more light hearted and I'm more aware of my surroundings and the people. I'm also aware of my own emotions and feelings and I'm able to control them. I'm definitely going to keep practicing this method of meditation for the rest of my life and I will share this information with many people as I can. I would like to thank professor Duck Joo Lee from the bottom of my heart for teaching this valuable method of self reflection meditation and I wish him good luck and good health to continue this good mission in the future and I wish all his hopes and wishes in his life will come true.
