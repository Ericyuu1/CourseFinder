59771217~COURSE!~6OW7QJ3WEeWILQ7D3uPEMw,1600726038982,3,0,"Course was not up to par with other Coursera courses I have taken.   There was some very good content n the course but the course itself was put together very unprofessionally.   Beginning in the first introductory video there were many typos and errors in the translation from the subtitles.  One of the worst is when Ron Fry talks about helping with societal issues. the translation is suicidal issues. "" Your going to learn about novel cutting edge approach to leading and facilitating positive change that can be applied at all levels. In dyads, small groups, teams or work units, total organizations, communities, entire supply chains, across industries and even for suicidal issues.""   The Peer Review has been a problem in other Coursera courses but my experience was worst in this one.  I actually flunked one assignment getting 100% score from one reviewer and 0% from another.  The person who game the zero left no comments as to why.   One of the things that made the Peer Review scoring difficult is that the choice was to grade on a scale of 0 to 10 but 0 and 10 were the only options.  Many times I wanted to give a score of something in between but was unable to with this system.   The Peer review for the last assignment required three reviewers.  It took me about 10 days of going back each day, sometimes several times a day to get someone's assignment to review.  It seems that would be an easy fix of only requiring two reviews instead of three if there were limited assignments. Finally, unlike other Coursera courses I have taken, this one did not allow me to add my certificate to Linkedin.   I am glad I took the course, I learned a lot.  I wish the course was put together at a higher level quality than it was so that it would be on par with other Coursera courses.",0,0,David Randle,59771217
