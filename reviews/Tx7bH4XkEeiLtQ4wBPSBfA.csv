I began with no SAS experience and after I took the course, I could actually start coding a bit and understand basic syntax. I feel a lot more confident in engaging in coding :) I feel that the course could have provided an in-more depth exploration of different concepts and ideas behind the code we were doing - sometimes I could write the code and complete activities but I wasn't sure the purpose behind it so I brute forced the code to work haha. Also activities could have used more interleaving, e.g., have a practice activity that requires you to use all knowledge and skills gained from all weeks rather than test them individually a week at a time. At the end of it, I wasn't sure how confident I would be using the coding skills as I learnt each skill in isolation from each other (e.g., you learn how to prepare data in week 4 but only focus on exporting data in week 6 so there's little holistic learning).",0,0,Cheryl Ou,92841868
