117346700~COURSE!~HJ-ixLNjEeuulAq3NfAu8w,1666781655710,1,0,"T​he course is solid until the end, where you must wait for your peers evaluate your final paper.  Seems like a bait and switch tactic and students such as myself may never complete the course as one waits for a peer to pick my paper.  Furthermore, each student must evaluate four other peers' papers and I've evaluated six but yet I wait.  There are folks in forums that are waiting for their final score for months.  This is problematic and not the stated conditions when I agreed to take and pay for this course.",0,4,Matt F Riesenberg,117346700

The concepts build nicely from start to finish, the professors did an excellent job of explaining the material and the slides were a great visual supplement. This should all be basic blocking and tackling when teaching - but it's not. I've taken other courses offered by higher education institutions and the ""teaching"" tends to be just a compilation of different reading exercises and random video interviews or discussions with professors - the material may have been interesting and informative, but it wasn't oriented to teaching.With this course, I didn't have to work hard to grasp the basic concepts and instead had brain space to think more deeply about what I was hearing.",0,3,Ruthanne Smith,19594648
