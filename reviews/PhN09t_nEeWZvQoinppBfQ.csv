15842855~COURSE!~PhN09t_nEeWZvQoinppBfQ,1610131651410,5,0,"Excellent specialization. This is one of the best courses about soft skills that I followed on Coursera. This specialization is concrete, which is sometimes hard to do with soft skills.Warning: there is one important issue because there are almost no students in this Capstone... It means that you will have to wait up to several months to be graded (3 months for me)... Otherwise, I recommend this course, there is some amazing content.",0,1,Bernard De Villepin ,15842855
