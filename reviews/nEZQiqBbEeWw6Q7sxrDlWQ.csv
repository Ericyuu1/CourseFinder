It qualifies well as a support for further studies in microeconomics. We regret, however, to have seen few if any traces of where assumptions can be re-qualified and relaxed, how do the modellings apply in real life, within what conditions, etc. Case studies to prove that 'theory works', with examples from recent history, would have been welcome and useful.
