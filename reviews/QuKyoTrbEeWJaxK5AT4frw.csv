While I have no doubt the instructors know their subject, I feel that English is not their first language and it showed in the text that came with each video.  Syntax was not the best, nor was grammar or spelling.  This did in fact cause me so much confusion and while I took extensive notes, I struggled to find the answers to the quiz questions and struggled to understand what was being taught in the Manuscripts portion.  I loved the history part but felt that important issues were missed (as they did come up on the quizzes) in the lectures.  I think this is one I will work on my own research.  The text from the videos needed someone to edit them to make sense of them.  ",0,0,Sherry Sanders,82507618
61993318~COURSE!~QuKyoTrbEeWJaxK5AT4frw,1592320955519,2,0,"The historical context portions were probably all right, but I found the codicology sections troubling. I trained as a bookbinder and am now a book conservator. Most of these examples are from the final week because it is freshest in my mind, but they hold true for the rest as well. The videos and quiz questions are full of errors, both spelling and factual, and the video transcripts were clearly not proofread. Some of this can be attributed to translation problems, for example the two broad categories of paper, laid and wove, were called ""watermarked and non-watermarked"". There were many instances of incorrect or misused terminology, such as ""gauffering"" for ""tooling"" (tooling is the general term, gauffering generally refers to edge decoration) and the confusing insistence on ""quaternio"" when ""octavo"" is far more common in my experience. Again, this could be chalked up to translation issues.Others were simply careless, for example one of the questions asked you to select ""concave spine"" as an innovation of Gothic bindings, when a concave spine was actually a problem resolved by Gothic bindings by rounding the spine into a convex shape. There were some not just careless but actively counterproductive errors. One of the questions claimed that the use of sewing supports made the board attachment weaker, when the opposite is true. Boards sewn on with the thin sewing thread are much more likely to detach than a thick thong of alum-tawed leather laced into the boards. In the quiz, a model with a stereotypically Carolingian headband was misidentified, on the grounds that ""the headband doesn't look very Carolingian"". (I later checked the link, which led to a completely different model of a Romanesque binding, which might put this in the ""careless error"" category, except that the note on the quiz mentioned a feature which is not present on the Romanesque model.) In a previous week, the video and a quiz question on iron gall ink claimed that the reason iron gall ink causes deterioration was because it was acidic, when the acidity has very little effect compared to the excess of unbound iron ions, which cause oxidation reactions in the substrate. I wrote my thesis on this subject, and I grant that it might be easier to say ""it acts like it is acidic"" rather than explain the chemistry, but the correct explanation is given in one of the links for further reading, on a website for high school level science. I would not recommend this course, although the links for further reading could be useful. The Les Eluminures documents seem very well produced. The instructor for the history component was also very good, and I appreciated the recognition that history is complex and interconnected, and the links to projects on less-studied topics like Cahokia and pre-Colombian contact with the Americas.",0,16,Avery Bazemore,61993318

However, some links and readings are no longer accessible but thankfully, the missing readings are not detrimental. The instructions are largely present but you would often need to consult external sources for the detailed know-how. The time indicated in completing the weekly assignments need to be taken with a pinch of salt. What is an hour can translate to several as you need to account for trial-and-error or the time taken to buy the necessary materials for the project.

First up, even though projects assignments are one or the other, you have to submit both else Coursera will keep telling you you're missing an assignment. Also every video starts with a 35 second song introduction, and each week has at least 6 videos, so that's 3.5 minutes of wasted time on average per week. Then there's credits at the end of each video that is even longer. Learning from the videos are a nice way to learn something passively, but so much of the class is about manuscripts fine details that it would be nice to see documentation and diagrams in readable form instead of video. It's sad to see the message pop up saying 89% of your class failed the quiz, watch this video multiple times.

Her videos are the most instructional of the class. That said, there are two instructors, and Dr. Martinez-Dávila mostly introduces a series of reading materials, so there are hardly any videos on the history component of the class. Also, the weekly assignments are quite lengthy and require quite some work. For these, there is a deadline of only one week and the feedback from students is very diverse, depending on whether they are themselves librarians or not.

I realize English is not Dr. Sanchez's first language, but she was stiff and obviously reading the text. There was little or no inflection. Her attempts at humorous or light comments fell flat because of this and didn't add anything. I would also like to have seen the writing portions of the lesson integrated into the history.

More importantly, I now know the terminology used and can differentiate the different periods in which the books were bound.  What I loved most was the hands-on-project, which takes the students through the full process of not only creating an illuminated manuscript, but it also drives the student to one of the most important elements which makes up the codex, the binding.  Participating in the above process is invaluable.  If you're a lover of illuminated manuscripts, or letters, the freedom towards the creative process is quite ""illuminating.""  Coming up with the content for the copy and the corresponding illustrations was quite fun and somewhat unnerving at the same time.  I was nervous about approaching the illumination, not of the letters, but of the other elements such as the initials.  Once done, though, it was a very satisfying feeling.  The binding process was a bit unnerving as well, not because it's so difficult, but because I didn't necessarily have all the tools.Having said, this, I would have given the course 5 stars.  I gave it 4, only because, the binding process ""how to"" was not the most clear.  Otherwise, this is an excellent course which I highly recommend.
