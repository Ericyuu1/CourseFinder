39864187~COURSE!~nq1edvtDEeSsDCIACzaSPQ,1638808559203,5,0,"Having studied Popular Music and Production at degree level in the 90's, this is a great Music Business oriented course with a high level of detail. It covers historical developments in the Record Industry and the business of Publishers and Concert Promoters as well. Musicians who have developed their creative skills and want to find out about how the music business works 'under the hood' as it were, could extend their existing knowledge with this course. While it would cost a pretty penny to do a course like this at a University, Musicians can study here online with Coursera for free. Excellent!",0,1,Topher Neville,39864187

There are facts that I lived throughout the music evolution that I had forgotten. But taking this course not only reminded me a lot, but took me deeply into the many details I missed. Plus, this course showed me a lot of what I lacked in the past business ventures.This course also guided my previous acquired knowledge. Because of the chronograph order and the way professor Darko  exposed the facts, I was able to reorganize my knowledge and experience and re-save it in a much useful order in my brain.
I feel much more professional and ready to re-take my businesses and return to the music industry.Thank you so much Coursera, West Virginia University, professor Darko Velichkovski and all professionals involved in the making of this amazing peace of art.I sincerely recommend it.Andrei SoulsilenS",0,0,A01- C-Sec.,9684162
