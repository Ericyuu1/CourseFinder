hangouts at the beginning of the course should have been a red flag for how
tedious it was going to be. The information provided is several years old. Aric Rindfleisch did amazing job to keep earlier course

be kept current, this one is abysmal.  The
blatant idea theft and plagiarism are rampant to the point where students
were adding watermarks to their pdf submissions to try to stop others from
stealing their work. The peer
evaluation is a joke. I felt like my final project was downgraded because I
didn’t include pages and pages of rambling replies. One reviewer didn’t even
bother to look for word count or sources cited, etc. It’s disappointing and I

However, the biggest challenge and disappointment was the capstone. The case given is pertaining exclusively to the North American market. Students enrolling into the course are situated globally which makes it extremely challenging to gather data to understand and substantiate our work on the project. Several hours of extensive research yields no usable data which could provide a logical direction to the project. Reading material provided explains mainly the company profile, a few links are blocked due  to geographical restrictions, reports that are available are to be purchased etc. While the money invested is not refundable now, however coursera with university team needs to seriously resolve this point.

It was harder to understand what was said in the lecturer; some speakers were too soft/low (volume), unclear pronunciation and some was clear for sure. It was almost giving me impression that the call/ interview with clients were impromptu instead of well prepared. There was some part of video when Mr Sachdev mentioned ""Marketing in the Digital World with Dr. Eric Rindfleisch. Then the two courses on analytics with Kevin Hartman, and then two other courses on managing the channels or understanding how you manage channels in the digital age with Dr. Yannon Clifton."" At one point i got confuse who is Dr. Yannon Clifton???? I didn't attend/ take any course with her/him. The idea of capstone is essential for completion of this specialization.
