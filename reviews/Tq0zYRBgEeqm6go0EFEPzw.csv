DeFi is not really covered (at least not enough for being in the title of the course). Blockchain business models like bAirbnb... yes there have been some attempts, but 4 years in, it is not the killer application.Also, it has not really answered why Bitcoin would have value (or not). Nassim Taleb's 2021 paper would have been an interesting counterpoint. Why I give it 2 stars?
