I had a very basic understanding of what blockchain is by reading articles and watching a few videos on YouTube and really wanted to get into just a little more detail on 'how' it actually works and makes interesting new things possible. But this course was just more of the ""it's really great"" without hardly getting into any detail of explaining how it actually works. I've seen 5-10 minutes videos on YouTube that give a better idea of how it works than this course. To be fair, many reviewers seem to have found this course to be useful so I guess it depends on what you're looking for specifically. I just found it to be too theoretical without nearly enough practical examples of it's implementation or application.",0,1,RS,28061611

This course is absolutely not what I expected, lack of deep and technical explanations about the blockchain, if you are there for cryptography and computer science you are definitely in the wrong place. It is extremely repetitive so that it gets annoying, boring and especially frustrating. The Tapscott teachers keep throwing in the air quotes of Nobel price laureate and founder of blockchain start-up we never heard off.  The last course is only a peer to peer review. I have been stuck for three weeks waiting for reviews. The funniest part ? I actually bought their book and checked their other specialization ""Blockchain Revolution for financial services"", it is the EXACT SAME SET OF COURSES with different titles. I am seriously  questioning the incentives of the teachers/authors.    Finally I strongly believe that in the fast paced world we are living in it is critical for people to deeply understand the technology that surrounds them and it is not what those courses or this specialization is doing.

I'm not an absolute beginner, but I thought this class did a great job building knowledge- starting with how blockchain technology works.  My two issues with the course:  1) The discussion forums are such a waste.  This is Coursera's fault.  However, in such an emerging field, I really wanted to interact with others.  If you pay discussion board monitors, Coursera....fire them and have a program monitor responses.  (2)  Like the other courses I took in this specialization (I took them a bit out of order), the quality goes down hill as you go.  The first few weeks were great and I learned a lot.  Week 5 was all about objections with no real answers or opinion from the Tapscotts that were reasonable.  Like other courses, the Tapscotts introduce all of these objections and discuss them- awesome.  But then the solution is always Blockchain is awesome or we don't really know how Blockchain can overcome this.  Great also.  BUT THAT IS NOT A COURSE.  In real school, professors offer opinions- usually based on their own research.  The Tapscott's shy away from this and take an idealistic approach or no approach at all when addressing challenges.  The point of a course is that you might disagree with your professors, but that's the point- to think.  You don't have to be 100% right unless you're teaching like neuroscience.  This is a business class- take a position and actually back it up.  I feel like this makes the last session a complete waste of my time, and this is true of the other courses as well.

Despite having a strong background in blockchain technology, I benefited a lot through the technically-correct presentation of the big picture, given the history of technology and its adaptation in general. Another major strength is that blockchain is explained in terms of what it can do (real-world applications), not only what it is (technically). This is definitely a go-to course for anyone not wishing to get lost in the ocean of materials explaining blockchain-- nonsense-free. If you're more serious, I recommend buying at least the referenced books beforehand: the presenter's ""The Blockchain Revolution"" and Andrea Antonopoulos's ""Mastering Blockchain"" 2nd edition.
