44017534~COURSE!~p79Awdv8EeeCEw5jIEhNXg,1596410023090,5,0,"I had recently taken up courses on 3D CAD by Prof. Jessy Kang of National Taiwan University on Coursera. The courses were well organized with practical examples and quizzes to challenge students understanding all along. It was divided into two components, where the first one explained the fundamentals, and the second one was about applications in real-world projects.The most important thing about learning a skill is to be able to use it in practice. I was able to use the different advanced functions to create a 3D model for an upcoming industrial building as part of my company's project. By making 3D models, we can enrich proposals for space planning. If the owner has a specific idea, we can change the model immediately and discuss it. This reduces the time of discussion as 3D models are more comfortable to comprehend for the owner. In this way, we can make sure that the building, in reality, turns out the same as whats in the owner's mind.",0,0,Aneesh Keni,44017534

Though the instructors don't really teach how to read the floor plan and details (which makes it overwhelming), I was able to learn a thing or two from interpretation when doing the assignments (while following step-by-step videos). The only thing that I think can be improved is peer assessment. Having different versions from others makes it difficult to grade or be graded as an older version software can't open a newer version's work.",0,1,Tan Si Ying,49804940
