Especially the most of the software mentioned were really difficult to download and install as they were really out of date...,0,4,Srinidhi Chandrasekaran,48095479

46708107~COURSE!~wTIIEafpEei1dwpypT7buA,1583417592339,1,0,"The instructor knows what she's talking about but is difficult to understand - she speaks quickly with a heavy accent and even the course notes don't always accurately track what she says. The techno-music in the background during the lectures is very distracting - lower the volume or get rid of it. Finally, you apparently need a computer science degree to install the Apache Cassandra program for Windows as the installation instructions given in the course are wildly outdated - the installation procedures have completely changed since this was recorded. I was unable to properly install this critical program and Coursera was completely unable to help me. This course was a big waste of my time. ",0,3,Chris Benedict,46708107

17082196~COURSE!~wTIIEafpEei1dwpypT7buA,1564389499266,1,0,This course does not have much content. You can find most of the content with a quick Google and I don't see why anyone should pay for this. The exercise in week 2 was just a copy-pasting exercise. The exercise in week 3 and 4 are not doable since the data is not given. The exercise for week 5 was great and I enjoyed it. I feel that the exercises for the other weeks should follow the one in week 5. Week 6 just had two super short quizzes. I did not learn much from this course. ,0,2,Rayson Lim,17082196
