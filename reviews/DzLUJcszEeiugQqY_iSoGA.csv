10941522~COURSE!~DzLUJcszEeiugQqY_iSoGA,1630966104357,4,0,"I love the way Janet teaches throughout the course. Her explanations are clear, concise and very informative. What I think is that most of what she shares is only kept in the voice of the videos, not on the slides. So the slides are not really a helpful in the course, and I think they ougt to be. It would be great if they could capture and summarize what Janet is talking about in each lecture. For instance, in order to take notes during the different lectures, I could not rely on the slides, I had to listen to the video many times, pause it, take my own notes, go back and listen again, an so on. So looking at the slides on the screen was actually not helpful. Jane's narrative was what I had to focus on and summarize it myself.Another important point is this: I'd recommend the use of tables to summarize the information provided on EOs. For instance, for Week 4, a table with the EO names in rows and a columns to indicate (with a simple checkmark) if the oil is used to treat pain or anxiety, would be great. The same goes for Week 5 when dealing with nausea and fatigue. I had to draw those tables myself in my own notes, in order to be able to fix in my what each EO was good for. In a nutsell, bullet points on slides are quick to draft and share, but graphical information is way more useful for learning purposes.Hope this feedback helps! It was a great course to take. I'll be making the most of it in my everyday practice :D.",0,2,Paula Sanchez-Romeu,10941522

I have always purchased them already blended and have not known how to blend them myself or different delivery methods.  I am very happy to have learned all the things I learned from this course as I plan to volunteer at Hospice and I can use this alternative comfort care on patients if they decide they want it as another tool to help them.  Thank you so much for this great course!!!!!",0,2,Susan Fernandez,40690259
