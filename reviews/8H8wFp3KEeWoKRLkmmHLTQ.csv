82200228~COURSE!~8H8wFp3KEeWoKRLkmmHLTQ,1620939662103,1,0,"As of this writing (currently in the middle of week 3) I can't recommend this class to anyone that has never had a stats class. Week 1 and 2 are well done and easy to follow and I felt like I learned a lot. Then they change the teacher in week 3 (not sure why) but he's not very good, he has a lot of great information (I'm guessing) but he does not have an affective way of communicating this.  He's very math oriented and mostly lectures with little hands on or excel methods.  I've finished 3 of the 4 of his videos and he opened excel 1 time on the first video for approx. 10 mins regarding a histogram and again in the last video for approx 15 mins. The first question on the test is about figuring out how many times a hockey team with a 2/3 probability to win will win in 12 games. The only time in the first 3 videos that he's mentioned any type of similar real world example was on video 2 around the 1:44 marker. He never once opens an excel sheet to show you how to set it up or what kind of formula to use in order to figure it out or how to apply the information he lectured on to real world examples. It's a lot of variables, a lot of formulas, and a lot of vocabulary but nothing on the week 3 test has really correlated with what I've learned. I'm not even sure if I'm going to finish this certificate because I have no idea how I'm going to learn the information the test is asking for when the teacher didn't explain really any of it.

The good ones (in general thanks to Sergey) are that sometimes during this course you learn something new and useful. But not much... One can hardly say that you will get some sort of ""specialization"" through these 5 courses. It's highly inconsistent. I'm sorry to say that but it's not the Harvard level of education (at least I hope that the Harvard level is much higher). This part is still far from the wonderful introduction by Professor Waterman. And the 3rd week of this part is a total fiasco: we all know how to read, and mechanical reading from the screen by the teacher doesn't give anything for knowledge. I also didn't understand the part about 'time constrains' as a pretext to describe only normal and uniform distributions (we can read anywhere about these two probability distributions... but where is the value-added product of the teachers?). I would say that selecting the same (very long) range in Excel with a mouse cursor seven times in one lesson is total waste of time that could be spent more effectively.
