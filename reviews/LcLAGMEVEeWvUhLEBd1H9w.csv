A class Zoom meeting with the instructor at the start would be helpful to address the constant changes occurring in music technology like the free Bandlab Cakewalk DAW.   Students build on an original composition during each of the four weeks.   Unlike  a music business course, production really needs as much two-way feedback as possible when you are in the learning stages, and it's only provided by other students rather than by the instructor or a production pro.    A recommended viewing of George Martin - In My Life (1998) [VHS] available on Utube in the beginning would do wonders for understanding the role of a producer.  Taking a songwriting and mixing class beforehand is also recommended  so that you can focus on learning producing rather than wearing the  hats of songwriter,  musician and recording engineer while trying to learn producing.

What I loved about this course was that the videos didn't set the main goal to be overly complicated or use extremely complex techniques. Its actually the opposite for me. Many of the videos contained very basic but essential tips which help you shift your focus from an technical point of view to putting the feel and emotions that the music transmits into the spotlight. Moreover the instructor of this course gives a very positive and encouraging feel which made the videos a pleasure to watch. In conclusion I can recommend this course warm-heartedly to beginners but also to advanced music producers that feel like they got lost in all of the technical aspects to find the way back to the origin of the music: EMOTIONS,0,0,Pascal Schopf,87358443

The homework did at least a couple of great things for me. First, it disciplined me to actually finish writing a song! The First Commandment for aspiring writers is, ""Write every day!"" Now I see why. Striving for creativity even when inspiration was ebbing was a revelation. Having a completed song is icing.Second, the homework not only gave me a new perspective on music and art, it gave me a new perspective on myself and my music. In trying to determine my artistic identity and vision, I was struck by how little I knew myself as an artist. My influences didn't show up in the homework the way I expected, and I actually sound more like some artists I don't listen to. Disconcerting but really good to know!I also enjoyed classmates' music, goals, influences, and perspectives. While grading classmates' work I'd listen to their influences, which exposed me to artists I'd never have even heard of otherwise. Even cooler was enjoying a classmate's music that was unlike anything I'd heard before.  Finally, Stephen Webber is a fantastic, engaging instructor. His enthusiasm was contagious.

or worse, I’m a self-taught recording artist (lookup “Don Manolo Frutorama” in

lessons given in this course are truly valuable and empirically verifiable. On
top of that, Stephen Webber is a super likeable guy who explains complex themes
like reverberation, sound proofing or microphone types in a pretty
straight-forward manner without ever being condescending. I especially liked
his use of this famous quote attributed to Orson Welles: “The enemy of art is
the absence of limitations.” and his advice on avoiding the pitfalls of digital
audio. I also found very valuable the lessons about Identity, Vision and Intention and The
Rule of Threes. If you’re new to the world of music production or just someone

I audited it, so I couldn't/didn't do the assignments but I found it really interesting so I binge-watched the lectures in the space of a day. The way the course is set up as compared to Intro to Music Prod. it is a lot less detailed technical instruction and more of a broad look at the artistic/aesthetic/philosophical components of various aspects of music production. And since Loudon touches upon this in the other course, I would say the two courses nicely complement each other and are both worth watching all the way through. I think they could be taken in any order, but personally, even though Intro is more technical, I think I got more out of this one having already taken Intro. Even as someone who considers myself pretty good as far as lyrics/songwriting/composition, I still got something new and useful out of those parts and liked the way the instructor put these ""creative"" parameters in concrete terms. The way he talked about and clarified Vision, Identity, and Intention I personally found very empowering, interesting, and practically useful. I feel like some of these ideas had been floating around in my mind before, but it validated that they were valuable things to be thinking about. There are a couple specific things that popped up in the course that are really cool and useful: for example, the rule of threes, and the information on panning, delay, mixing, etc. Very glad I found it! I hope these keep being offered for free because I find them more efficient for learning than some YouTube videos, and at some point I would consider doing one not just audited but ""for real.""
