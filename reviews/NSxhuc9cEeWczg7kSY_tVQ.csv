In the third quiz, the professors clearly gave up on teaching.  On all quizzes, their egos were very apparent to show how much they knew and not teach us, students.  The job of teachers is to teach and then test absorption.  You will find terms in here not taught.  So you will need to read on your own.  The examples are so basic that when you get to quizzes, additional reading is necessary to understand how topics and concepts apply in the real world.  Quiz questions are also subjective enough that there are other right answers, but they want you to pick the best answer through their perspective.  I have a ton of respect for teachers and appreciate good ones.  I believe the professors of this course are good teachers.  It does not show here.
