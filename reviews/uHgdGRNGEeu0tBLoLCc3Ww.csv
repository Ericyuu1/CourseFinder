89917390~COURSE!~uHgdGRNGEeu0tBLoLCc3Ww,1647296684538,3,0,Has some good and useful content but like the rest of the courses in this specialization it looks a lot like a Google cloud infomercial. The graded labs are ok. I have mixed feelings about ungraded ones as a few are really good and some others are a waste of time.  I think that students need to be harder in the way they rate these types of courses to force the vendor to deliver quality labs end-to-end. ,0,13,Enrique Corro,89917390

If you don't you might learn something, i.e. regarding model serving. Unfortunately the labs are pure copy/paste exercise (qwiklabs) and do not yield any practical inisght.

The Qwiklabs were a bit harder to follow sometimes. I would recommend introducing labs where the student has to do more him/herself. This way, you can really understand the concepts better.

16693917~COURSE!~uHgdGRNGEeu0tBLoLCc3Ww,1657949504995,5,0,"This course is exceptional. Why? Because even for people that have worked in production environments (which the course is geared towards) professionals often ask themselves if there are tools they're missing or not optimally taking advantage of when considering new production grade ML models. This course provides that path of ""best practices"" when it seems like most cloud-based courses are 1-off's of a specific tool but not how they are, or can be, integrated together. Coming from a much heavier AWS-based knowledge it was additionally refreshing to get up-to-speed with what GCP is offering. The education around getting up with Kubernetes and Kubeflow was great. Often it feels like productionalizing ML models is hacking together components to get any solution rather ""knowing"" a best path. Again, this course does a great job of setting some finite path with different tools (albeit production machine learning is fairly subjective based on company requirements/budgets/etc..). I feel confident I now know enough about tools inside of GCP to help make those artistic decisions about when and why I might opt for more production-grade ETL tools (Dataflow + Apache Beam) and when an ""easier"" batch processing setup with less complexity is merited. Learning basics of specific tools like Kubernetes was also a big plus.",0,1,Kevin,16693917
