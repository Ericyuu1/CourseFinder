I miss the level of intensity if the previous course in the series ""Computer Science: Programming with a Purpose"", where completing each lesson was result of additional reading and hours of exercises, so the reward there was greater as well as the stickiness effect of the skills learned. The harder to gain the knowledge, the higher the chances it stays there for good.Overall the course is great and Robert Sedgewick is a legend with great touch and delivery. To sum up - just make this course harder to pass with more hands on exercises and circuits to build :) and maybe add some certificate as this gives much more satisfaction and purpose to the students. I think Princeton should change their policy for this even if the certificates are marked as ""figurative"" just have this badge for people to carry on with them as a sense of achievement down the road.Thank you, it was a great journey for me.",0,1,Petar Marinov,11069209

This course certainly allowed me to refresh memory on many  philosophical CS topics and even learn something new.The idea of teaching programming from the lowest-level possible and the introduction of TOY-8 assembly with !!!cpu schematics!!! is a very good idea. Gradual transition from mathematical concepts to physical hardware is what makes this course unique.This class is not about programming. This class is not about algorithms. It it a good CS 101 introductory course. It is for somebody who already knows math, logic, basic electronics and basic programming to give a taste on what CS is about. Or for somebody like me to refresh memory on rarely used topics.For introductory course it is too heavy-weight in my opinion.
