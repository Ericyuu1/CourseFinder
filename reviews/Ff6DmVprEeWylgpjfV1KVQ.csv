Lo malo esq he tenido que esperar mucho al final del curso porque no me calificaban mis compañeros y he tenido que ponerme en contacto con coursera y era porque no habia bastantes alumnos.

It is very well structured and presented in a functional and easy form that allows understand the language and the business matter. we are being guiding to launch a product or service by hand. By the language is fantastic because we receive a huge and proper business vocabulary as well as English  language without translation. Another point is that each instructor has a different accent, speed and way to talk . This is good because we have the opportunity to adapt our ears and be able to understand a little more. Now, the instructors are fantastic . Each of one of them do their Best. I want to thank you for the effort you do helping us. I also thank to my peers.. they gave  their time to read all my work and their opinion about it. And finally there is something I missed and was the comments about our work. I think it is necessary to have an input from who has designed, structured and given the course. Many thanks again. Maria  ",0,4,maria huitron,28512233
