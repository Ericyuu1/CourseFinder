I had this impression because of two reasons. First off, in a public speaking course, one would expect the instructor to be a professional public speaker. The instructor however felt like he's vastly overreacting and therefore unconvincing. The second reason is that the material felt like pseudo-science or opinion-based. I could not sense any power point in either the instructor or the material. Again, I might've been unfair in my review because I didn't watch enough, but I thought I should share this to allow people to manage their expectations.",0,0,Aly Elhaddad,16952674

Additionally, it seems that the system is very vulnerable to bots. I had reviews that made no sense at all.

It was great, enjoyable and very insightful and covered a lot of ground for an introduction course. The timings were manageable and focused. The teachings were clear and concise which made it much easier to learn and complete the assignments. The course had many positives but one of my many takeaways would be that It not only teaches you how to think about (and deliver)  your speech, it also touches on how to listen, break-down and decode other speeches from a listeners perspective.I fully recommend to anyone who is thinking of taking this course to do it, I found it very useful and it's a skill I'll be practicing and fine-tuning for a long time.

Let me share with you 5 skills I learned from this course:                      1) I learned to craft and evaluate a speech project by using the rubrics;                                                        2) In order to keep my speech delivery within the time limit, I applied the  speech structure and practiced a lot to deliver  my message succinctly. 3)  By understanding that writing is different from delivering speeches, I learned that I do not need to memorize each word . This allayed my fear of forgetting what I was supposed to say.  4) By recording myself in video format, I was able to conduct a self assessment on  areas of improvement in terms of body movement, gestures, mannerism, voice, pitch, rate based on the lecture and what was modeled by Prof Matt  on top of peer evaluations .  5) I learned to create an unlisted  you tube video.Thank you so much Dr  Matt McGarrity  and to the University of Washington for offering this online course!
