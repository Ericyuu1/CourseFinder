119667300~COURSE!~mlAZb8cEEeyduw6ktL3Xvw,1676128067712,5,0,"I recently completed the ""Introduction to Mobile Development"" course on Coursera and I am extremely satisfied with the quality of the content and the instructor's teaching style.The course covered all the basics of mobile development, including creating websites with HTML & CSS. The instructor provided clear and concise explanations, along with visual aids and hands-on coding exercises, that helped me to fully understand and apply the concepts.One of the things I appreciated most about the course was the focus on practical skills. The instructor provided a step-by-step approach to building a complete mobile app, and I was able to put my newfound knowledge into action right away. The course also included several projects and quizzes that allowed me to test my understanding and build my portfolio.The course's structure and pacing were also excellent, with each week building upon the previous one in a logical and manageable manner. The instructor was always available to answer questions and provide support, making the learning experience engaging and enjoyable.I would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in mobile development, regardless of their prior experience. The course is well-suited for beginners, but also offers plenty of challenges for more advanced learners.In conclusion, I would give this course a resounding 5 stars for its comprehensive coverage of mobile development, practical focus, and engaging learning experience. If you want to get started with mobile development or take your skills to the next level, this is the course for you!",0,0,Minh Duc Vo,119667300
