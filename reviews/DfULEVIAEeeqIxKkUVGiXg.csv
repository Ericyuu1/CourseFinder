6808403~COURSE!~DfULEVIAEeeqIxKkUVGiXg,1596593235072,1,0,"A disjointed collection of leftovers and odds-and-ends from the other three courses. A third of the course assumes materials not presented in the prerequisites. Like the rest of this ""specialization"", contributes only to practicing one's algebra, little to practical engineering knowledge.",0,0,TIMOTHY LINENBRINK,6808403

44777726~COURSE!~DfULEVIAEeeqIxKkUVGiXg,1594037817191,4,0,The videos and assignments were very much rigorous and the author explained everything in a subtle manner.  I request the learners to brush up the basics of Control Theory and Power Electronics before taking this course. ,0,0,Sangeerth P,44777726
21613637~COURSE!~DfULEVIAEeeqIxKkUVGiXg,1590141530518,4,0,"It's an advanced course which gives for granted lots of things of electrical engineering basis. However, the teacher is really good at explaining things without making them too complicated. I really enjoyed doing it and it will for sure improve your work!",0,0,Marco La Salvia,21613637

29820764~COURSE!~DfULEVIAEeeqIxKkUVGiXg,1629851273844,5,0,The topics were very interesting for me because I work as an automotive engineer on power electronics products. The professor's explanations were clear and easy to follow. I recommend attending the other specialization on Power Electronics from Colorado Boulders before this course.,0,0,Davide Cavaliere,29820764

79261101~COURSE!~DfULEVIAEeeqIxKkUVGiXg,1613591642180,5,0,"This class shows and gives tools that are very useful in design simulation and analysis of power electronics circuits. This is a great class if you are looking for these skills and knowledge. The content is always a mix of circuit analysis theory and application to modeling and simulation. I wish there was more to it, but since it is such a short class, the theory is very surface level. ",0,0,Rhett Crismon,79261101
3728918~COURSE!~DfULEVIAEeeqIxKkUVGiXg,1612453048106,5,0,"I had completed the course on Power Electronics given by Prof. Erickson in 2014.  As this follow up course very much builds on that  with Matlab and LT Spice based examples, I had to go back review the previous course. But it was definitely worth  doing so as I could tie the theoretical with more practical aspects  of the design of converters giving me thereby the necessary expertise I was looking for.",0,0,R.P Aditham,3728918
