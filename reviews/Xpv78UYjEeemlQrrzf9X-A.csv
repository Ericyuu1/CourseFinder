There are no videos explaining proposed solutions so you will die in doubts if it is the case.3 - However, they can solve points 1 and 2 by keeping instructors participating actively in forums helping and guiding learners (in fact, this is the reason why I have paid for the course) but the reality is that the instructors are near to ""invisible"" and a lot of questions remains unanswered.For these reasons I feel totally cheated and will not try to finish the course and will lost my money.if I wanted to learn android I would have signed up for a course on that subject and not in a UML design course.My intention was to enrol me in the whole certification but I have realised that all the courses are Android based (and none of the them inform about such requirement) and after suffer the lack of help from instructors I will not enrol (or at least I will no pay) for them.",0,28,Javier Leyba,5922835

Course makes some things unnecessary complicated or don't explain things well and that makes learning annoying.Long version: I found many shortcomings and annoyances with this course. Course requires you to draw charts and diagrams for assignments without showing you proper example how it should be done. You need pretty much guess how they expect you to draw the chart or find examples elsewhere. Also you need to review another person's work before you get to see correct chart. How can you review and give feedback if you don't know correct answer? Course requires you to make charts based on code. Isn't this wrong way around?

Oddly, the video lectures are not delivered by any professor, but rather by some student reading from a script.  Still, these are decent, if a bit shallow and short.  The weekly quiz is also reasonable and makes for a good review of the material.  Where this course really falls down is on the capstone projects, especially the last one.  The projects generally include a lot of busy work and the solutions given are poor examples.  The last project is particularly bad.  It claims to test one's ability to code from a set of design artifacts, but in reality it requires significant background knowledge in Android development to get it to work and the bulk of the effort has little or nothing to do with the course content.  I recommend just watching the videos and doing the weekly quiz without doing the projects.  They aren't worth the effort and the last one is completely unreasonable.  I finished this course with a near perfect score, but I'm a 27 year industry veteran (just taking this to review my UML diagrams).
