1416898~COURSE!~cYz0Y3QxEeSdOyIAC1STUg,1634146795444,1,0,"Horrible course that does not look at today's realities of violence and what men and women are that influence the Violence laws in employment, society, and family.  The course is Jaded and does a review of 2010 statistics.  We are in 2021, almost in 2022.  Men and women need to look at themselves and their own passion to inflict pain and violence on others before they teach these classes.  Many officers, lawyers, and judges take enjoyment in harming the innocent.  Many innocent children suffer at their hands today.

The content is VERY important, but the presentation was not my cup of tea. There were many different instructors, none of whom seemed to be versed on how to engage listeners through video presentation. May times we are left listening to someone's monotone lecture as we watched their eyes go back and forth reading a teleprompter. I hope that the presentations can be edited to be more engaging. I recommend watching high rated course and studying what it takes to engage an audience. The actual content is so important!",0,0,Katie Glick,74546590

27803026~COURSE!~cYz0Y3QxEeSdOyIAC1STUg,1549355529794,3,0,"The title of the course is misleading, focusing almost exclusively on GBV, gang violence and shooting incidents in the US and leaving out other important forms of violence, like war, terrorism and some general historical, statistical and global dynamics. Gang violence or shooting incidents are relevant in the US, but not in most other countries. While gender based violence is incredibly important, it is not the only type of violence and in this case the focus should be added in the title of the course. The title promises a global perspective on dynamics of violence, but the course adopts almost exclusively a public health approach, which is by far not sufficient for discussing such a broad phenomenon as is violence.",0,7,Simona Mencinger,27803026
