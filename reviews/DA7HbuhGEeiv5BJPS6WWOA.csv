2005353~COURSE!~DA7HbuhGEeiv5BJPS6WWOA,1627134419335,1,0,"In my opinion, this  ranks as one of the most abysmal courses I have taken either online or in person. Not because of the  course content which is highly interesting and a final assignment which is very challenging but the way the course was conducted, spearheaded by an inept instructor and an apathetic staff support  assistant. Plus its disjointed placement as the last course in the Python 3 Programming SpecializationThis  is the culmination course in the Python3 Programming Specialization and has very little  connection to the previous four courses which were taught by instructors who were enthusiastic, empathetic and incredibly good at delivering the lecture content supplemented with great assignments and an excellent interactive textbook. After you complete the first four courses in this specialization and you think you are reaching the finish line, you get sprayed with a blast of shotgun fire in this last course. In this last course we have an instructor whose idea of pedagogy is presenting a set of code and content in Jupyter notebooks and parroting those notes. And you have a staff member who, instead of giving encouragement to students and responding to their questions responds with statistics on how many times a question has been answered and rambles on around the original question without directly answering the question. The final project is a total disaster and not one worthy of being included in an MOOC. There are multiple bugs in the instructions, no help from any source. This is the type of project that should be given to students attending Go Blue in person with supporting resources such as Grad Assistant tutors and the instructor himself. Instead we are told what packages to import and then do everything ourselves. The first four courses do not prepare you for this poor excuse for a final course.I have decades of programming experience both as a faculty member and a lifelong student and I was therefore able to complete the programming assignment which is replete with coding and execution problems. The execution times are enormous – anywhere from 15+  minutes for a single run which means that debugging is a nuisance. In my humble and honest opinion, this course appears to be included in this specialization to enable the course instructor the opportunity to get some enrollment and earn some bucks from the hapless  students who have completed the first four courses and feel it incumbent to complete the  specialization. If it were a stand-alone course, I doubt he would have many takers. Computer Vision
and Recognition are specialized areas. This is a course that needs to be under the umbrella of another specialization. It is not meant for learners who start the specialization with no prior or little  programming experience as stated at the time of start of the specialization.
On another matter, when I was peer-grading the assignments, I found that 90+% of the submissions were plagiarized code which I flagged. Out of the 15 assignments I attempted to peer-grade I found only two that had original content. Never, in any online course have I encountered such numbers. This clearly indicates that the students were desperate to complete the specialization and resorted
to submitting plagiarized code. The faculty at UM should discuss this more fundamental problem and ask themselves why such a situation is prevalent. No one connected with this course seems to give a damn about this. This course is a dismal mark to an otherwise elite university and its great faculty and a revelation on how terrible an instructor and his pedagogy can be. It is a travesty to the thousands of students, some from poor countries, who have enrolled in this specialization and paid fees with their hard-earned money. ",0,7,Rameses,2005353

But even though you have the good will to endure this fight, Jupyter isn't prepared to deal with the huge amount of data processing (in my opinion), so, it's a wasting time game of trying, running and waiting forever to receive an error, instead of learning to solve problems. The assessment is overdimensioned for jupyter. Dealing with 25mb+ files is unacceptable, because as students we need to debug the code too many times on try-and-error basis. I felt like going crazy and nervous with this final assessment.

I did the first four courses in about two months (they were so great!), and this last one, it took me more than 5 months, because at some point in time, I just abandoned it. The course needs to continue with the pacing of the other instructors, that were so good, and I felt everything was chained into a purpose. This last one, does not have any purpose at all.

It just shows a demonstration of some function calls, and then tells students to use the internet to figure out the rest. That wouldn't be a problem on its own, but there is no guidance on how to succeed in the final project, which is very difficult, without proper guidance. Ultimately the 'trick' here is just to brute force the problem. You pass in a 7200x6300 large image straight into pytesseract to run ocr on it. no segmentation, no nothing sophisticated. just pass in all these huge images straight into the pytesseract and opencv algos, twiddle your thumbs for 15 minutes and then search for a couple of striks in the OCR output and then display the results of the opencv face detection.in hindsight, I didn't really learn anything of value from this course. i didn't even learn pytesseract or opencv. i just hacked at it to get it to give me the outptus i needed to pass the assignment. i spent over 20 hours reading docs on these libraries, and trial and error running code, getting tracebacks, debugging etc. finishing the assignment felt like a relief, not an achievement. the discussion forums are completely useless. there is absolutely no discussion there at all. and the only active ""moderator"" / ""teaching assistant"" is an obnoxious individual who has turned the forum into a small private fiefdom.

77986160~COURSE!~DA7HbuhGEeiv5BJPS6WWOA,1613170867503,1,0,"This course is a massive disappointment at the end of an otherwise high quality specialization. Unless you really feel that you must get the certificate for the full specialization, your time is better spent elsewhere. Bottom line, this course is bad enough that I will avoid taking anything from this instructor or using the Jupyter programming environment again.1. The Jupyter programming environment used in this course is awful. The final project (90% of the course grade) takes literally hours to execute after your code is complete. Most of the time, the service will fail and require a restart before the code finishes. It doesn't matter if there are any errors in your code. Jupyter probably will time out before you can actually execute the entire program, even though your program won't be much more than 100 lines long.2. The instructors could have helped this by choosing a better focus area, but instead, the course focuses on intensive image processing that uses a lot of memory and processing power. I'm not sure why they made this choice, but it doesn't work well for something that is required to be completed in an online environment.3. This course is poorly designed. One of the main goals of this course, as listed in the introduction, is to teach students to use program documentation to build their own code. Unfortunately, the tesseract and opencv libraries (two of the three main libraries in the course) are not well documented - the instructor says as much during the course - and the student is effectively reliant on the instructor's background knowledge to make them work. I don't know why these specific libraries were chosen, but the experience would be better if they were changed to focus on something that could actually give the student independent experience.I could continue, but it would be more of the same.

Installation instructions are full of errata and prone to conflicts in a variety of environments. This leads to frustrated students and teaching staff, who are losing their professional tone in the forums. I get it, I also would not want to be troubleshooting massive multi-library installations for a variety of OSs for however-many-students Coursera hosts. Figuring out ""what to do next"" requires excessive guesswork and assumption. For instance, simply downloading and moving the lecture's .ipynb files to your local environment is only _alluded to briefly, in an optional video, without ever showing it done on screen_. The course then proceeds into an unrelated lecture. Feels very disconnected and jarring.The lectures are poor. They consist of the professor talking into the camera with no accompanying materials, and again a lack of clear direction. A concrete example: the professor talks through navigating to /usr/lib/python/site-packages/PIL/Image.py file and opening it in a text editor, all _without showing the screen or terminal_, while explicitly spelling out ""See-Dee"" (cd) and explaining that's how you change directories... What? There are several problems with this. 1) It is NOT an effective teaching technique to talk through such multiple dir/file traversals without showing the terminal, as it's easy to get lost from where the prof is talking about. 2) Even if there is an assumption here that the students are *SO* comfortable/advanced with *nix already that you can just talk them through that many cd's AND opening a text editor without messing up the file, WHY do you feel the need to explain what ""cd"" and ""ls"" do as if it's our first time using it? There is a strong and jarring disconnect here that makes it feel like the course was unfinished - as if the prof believed he'd have an onscreen accompaniment that never materialized. BAD.The jump in difficulty from the first 4 courses is huge, but it's largely because so many intermediary steps are ignored entirely or poorly explained. The logical composition of this course is nonsense - simple things are explained while complex things are overlooked. If by design it's _intended_ to provoke solution-searching from the student, then at least let the student know that they're expected to find the solution themselves.Overall I found this really frustrating, and a huge disappointment. Poorly thought-out, poorly executed. I imagine the people actually finishing this course are the ones who are REALLY invested in learning computer vision / these libraries for their own needs, and if you have that motivation, you can give it a try.

This assignment however was filled with so many issues along the way. Firstly, computing image data takes a considerable amount of time, throw in face recognition modules like opencv and it becomes even harder. I have a few things I liked and did not like about this particular course:What I liked:1) The fact that the week 1 assignment was so intuitive and yet challenging actually kept me hooked on to this course and finish this specialization.2) There are a lot of real-world applications with the content shared in this course. This happens to be the most (at least for me) practical course in the entire mega course for python.3) This course offered a fairly good amount of interaction with the Jupyter notebooks.What I don't like:1) The week 1 assignment was actually fun and challenging at the same time but, the hints provided for this assignment were little to no help. I'm sure there are better ways to make students read the docs more but, this shouldn't be one of those methods. 2) The week 3 assignment was probably the most annoying assignment of this entire course. The assignment looks fairly easy but, the entire code takes over 20 minutes just to execute. This can be a real issue when you're dealing with experimenting with images and image data.3) The files for this assignment were not readily available for use. I found out that they had the assets up for download in a separate thread which was not even pinned when it is so important.4) The notebook was taking so damn long that I decided to install Jupyter and work on my local machine with those files. This was a great improvement over the Coursera Jupyter notebook, though the video guide on how to install and setup Jupyter is outdated. 5) After spending a ridiculous amount of time coding this assignment, when the time came for submission, it was an even bigger pain. The assignment requires you to post the code to a text field but, this text fields removes and destroys all the indenting and formatting. I spent hours on end trying to format it correctly before restoring to uploading my code to online codeshare platforms like GitHub.6) The review process is even more difficult. You would have to run the peer's code and cross-examine their results. This was a huge pain since running the code can take anywhere from 20 - 40 minutes to complete.I hope the team takes this feedback constructively and uses the above-mentioned points to help improve upon those aspects.",0,4,Samanth N,64719983

I think it was a mess due to the following reasons:  -There were uncorrected mistakes that seemed to be there for like several months or even a year without solving. -The submission system for the final project was a nightmare and the Notepad++ solution they gave us was not working at all (I saw other students complaining about this in the forums). I had to copy my code several lines at a time to ensure that it would not lose formatting and checking that it had the correct indentation at each moment. Even then, after ensuring that everything was alright and seeing my own submission, there were some lines that were not formatted correctly even if I did input them correctly. I had to put a disclaimer to say that it was not my fault if the indentation was not the correct one. This situation has been going on for months and action has not been taken. This is unacceptable. -We were required to execute someone else's code for review in our own environment. I could only copy and paste another fellow student's code for review when using Microsoft Edge (Chrome and Firefox did not do the trick). -The staff moderating the forums was not really helpful. I asked about how to download a file that could not be download through the environment, but he would not say that the pinned posts in the forum were intended to help. Normally you do not expect to have that many errors in your course material, so it is normal to NOT expect that many tips to be available in the forums. -Each iteration of the code is like really low execute. The instructor claims that the big file in the final assignment took like 10 minutes to process, but that is far from reality. This leads to my next point. -The theoretical contents have not been clear and useful. We were told that certain things could be done to improve processing of the image, but none of it seemed to actually make anything better. For instance, when we applied the bounding boxes to the OCR, it did not seem to actually improve anything. What is more, it made OCR to work worse. -One of the parameters that were needed to make the pyteseract module correctly was not explained during the course. I would get really bad results over and over until I found one of the parameters and set it to a reasonable value. Even if the course is based on kraken, pyteseract and OpenCV, it is maybe a bit ambitious to expect the student to try and use those parameters, one of them without even mentioning it in the lectures. It would be understandable if the material provided was much faster to compute, but exploring two parameters, each with its own set of values is a really time consuming process. -It feels like most of the content in the lectures is junk and only 10% of that is really useful in the assigment. The other 90% actually makes things worse (as I said previously some recommended techniques did not work) and is presented in a convoluted way. I had this sensation many times during my university years, were the classes would be totally disconnected from the exam and with real practice.

After weaning us off of the on-line workbook (which is a very nice tool) and completing the previous four courses (which were very well done), this course takes a jarring turn.  For starters, the video to install Python went so far into the weeds I had to uninstall everything I was told to install and search for assistance from the web.  Because I work full time, I lost about a week just undoing and redoing the installation in my spare time.  The video lectures are average, although I found myself doing searches several times to understand why something was coded the way it was.  The Jupyter notebook they provide is unexpectedly unstable; I found myself copying all of my code to a separate file after losing portions of it, and more than once the kernel stopped and restarted itself, which really required a reboot to get it working properly again.  My final observation is the scoring - it's entirely pass or fail.  I don't agree with this - the project has several facets that I think can and should be assessed individually.  Yes, I understand that some university courses choose to grade a final project in such a way, but in a case like this I don't think it's appropriate.  At one point, my frustration level was high enough that I seriously considered forgoing the specialization certificate because I was spending too much time on it.

Ideally, this course would force the student to apply everything they learned in the first 4 classes to produce something interesting. Instead, it's a meandering skimming of a few image processing libraries. Was the goal to teach us how to read Python documentation? There are plenty of other ways to do that with simpler libraries that don't require long detours into abstract details about graphics.Lectures and instructions are riddled with errors. One video features a head shot of the instructor giving a verbal narration of navigating a console window. It feels like they meant to overlay it with someone actually performing the actions on a computer, but instead you get to imagine in your mind what a command prompt must look like. The python installation instruction video is wrong top to bottom - while the narrator reads out the instructions, the video actually shows them failing on input... but the instructor moves on. The final project is too complicated for the Coursera Jupyter environment and it takes ages to run. You can install the environment on your own computer, but the instructions for that are wrong too and don't have the right libraries (one isn't available for Windows!).

Courses 1-4 have the objective to teach you about Python language, how to solve software problems with Python, and to understand programming concepts like classes & objects.For someone who is starting with Python and never had learned concepts about image processing, this course could be somewhat overkilling. Image processing is usually more geared towards developers who want to get started with artificial intelligence or data science. There is another Michigan specialization in Coursera to accomplish that. I also think is somewhat difficult that a novice student could complete and understand the topics in this course in three weeks. This course requires, at least, five weeks and more homework, questionaries & examples.The lectures/videos mention a LOT of things (like Kraken) that are not required for the last project.I will repeat the first statement: the concepts are great, I loved the contents at some point, but this is not for everyone who is starting with Python.I think the University of Michigan is able to improve this course a lot.

The firsts four courses are awesome, well structured, with an interactive tool as Runestone which helped me a lot to understand the problems to pass the assessments.

The projects require you to learn new modules with minimal help, which is excellent for those who want to become a real programmer. The ability to learn individually is invaluable to any programmer, and this course did provide good training on self-learning. The problems with this course are also obvious. For example, there are quite a few errors in the jupyter notebook setup video for MacOS. Those errors might not be a big problem, but for people who did not have previous experience in setting up a virtual environment, the typos in captions could cause problems. That particular video did tell us what we need to do, but it just missed some details, and that made things a bit confusing.The next problem is with Coursera's peer review system. In the final project, we are instructed to paste our code to the Coursera textbox. However, the textbox is not code-friendly at all (it messes up all the indentation and spaces), and Coursera won't let us copy the codes other people submitted. These problems made it very hard to review other people's work. I am disappointed about it because I think the peer review session is, in fact, a good chance for us to learn from other students. The Coursera system is not making it easy for us to read and copy codes from others, and the instructor did not give us a proper workaround instruction in the submitting page. All these problems could actually be avoided if the instructor suggested a better submit option. Last but not least, I hope the instructor could make the videos more engaging than it is right now. Honestly, he did not add much value with those videos. He was reading the text on the jupyter notebook most of the time...I don't need someone to read the text out loud, I can read the notebook all by myself.

I was looking forward to a comprehensive project which could cover all the concepts and skills we learned from previous 4 courses, plus a little expoloration of new library.

I do recommend this project to those who have some experiences with python and would love to explore more python libraries.

So splitting down the middle with 3 stars. I appreciate what the instructor was aiming for, to push students into a hands-on, realistic programming project using third-party libraries, but the execution was quite lacking.Pros:1) While I felt the other 4 courses of the Specialization were too basic and too easy, this one is quite the opposite. It throws a real-world type programming project at you and gives you a serious challenge. Being challenged is when you learn the most.2) Learning how to integrate third-party libraries is a very useful skill.3) Nice to use a real Python environment like Jupyter Notebooks instead of a sandbox online environment.Cons:1) Enormous difficulty jump from the previous course in the Specialization to this one. If I didn't already have programming experience with other languages I would have likely found this course borderline incomprehensible.2) The course can't quite seem to be decide whether it wants you to setup your own Jupyter Notebook environment or use the Coursera Notebook. At first it seems to encourage you to create your own, but then doesn't give you a link to download the accessory files (images, etc) that are required to follow along. You have to search through the forums to find it. But, later on, you're introduced to a package Kraken that simply does not work on Windows (without actually telling you this so I wasted hours trying to install the complicated dependency chain through Conda only to find out the main Kraken package is Mac/Linux only). So then you're forced into using the Coursera notebook anyway for that part, and it is extremely slow.3) While it's good to experience integrating third-party libraries, I feel like this project uses too many. Including one (Kraken) that isn't even used in the final project, so why complicate things by covering it? 4) The way you submit the final project is a total mess. You have to copy & paste your code into a text box and then submit it. Another student then has to copy & paste the code into their Jupyter environment to test it out and give you a grade. But Coursera messes up the formatting to your code when you submit, which makes your code unusable by the other student. So you have to copy & paste your code to an online document like Google Docs and provide a link to the Google Doc.

makes you to do a lot of things by yourself. Of course, there are lecture
videos, but they show you some examples, not explain thoroughly every step of
your future assignment. For some of learners it presents a huge gap in the
learning process. Also, it raises such questions like “For what reason there
are lectures if you need to solve a lot for yourself?”. Well, I think that they
give you some direction to go in; give some insight how to deal with tasks that
you encounter in this course. At the same time, this creates for each learner
some kind of creative freedom. Those assignments of others that I saw during my
reviews were unique. I also learned a lot from them. The sad

There was absolutely no difference between the oral and written material. this is in principle a good thing BUT not when there's info lacking. For instance we're at the PIL discussion and the comment is ""I think that Image looks interesting""...well ok but why do you think that? what makes you think it's interesting. I've read the material first as per recommendation so I was hoping to get some insight as to why you chose one over any other...but nah. I don't know how difficult it would be for you to address this or you may choose to ignore it altogether but i've figured i should share since you're asking for feedback.There are a couple of things i've found fairly annoying and it would seem to me that they can easily be addressed. looking for image.zip for the last assignment -- I spent at least a couple of hours trying to find a copy of the image.zip file. I ended up downloading the py3.zip of 2 years ago or so. This is wasted time not time well spent. Why can this not be a link to the description of the assignment, meaning ""go to the appropriate google share and download py3.zip"", since the existing links to image.zip seem to be perpetually broken.Kraken does not run on Windows -- this came as a surprise; not your fault but it's important enough to be posted up front so folks with windows machines, like me, can get their setup going. it takes time to setup a docker container with the python development environment etc to make it useful.

But don't forget that this course is flagged as 'intermediate level' instead for 'beginner's level' (frankly, the fourth course, which is also flagged as 'intermediate', is not up to the mark in comparison with other 'intermediate' courses on Coursera -- it should have been flagged as 'beginner'). That being said, if I were the instructor, I might want to smooth the learning curve though. I found a lot of negative comments in the comment section before I actually took the course, so I was a little bit worried.

The four courses before built a strong foundation in python programming.

If one is not willing to do the work, then maybe programming isn't  her thing. I found this course challenging, but absolutely doable. It's an awesome feeling when you finally get your certificate.

While the previous four courses provided a great enviroment for zero background beginners to built up their basic Python skill set, the way students achieve a successful final project was always through intensive guiding (almost translating the code you're going to write completely in English with names of variables and objects all set for you). In this final course students are half-way pushed more towards the wild to work on something more like real-life projects that you may encouter at work and put your Python skills and programming mindset to a real test. It's much more difficult compared to the previous four and students need to take more initiatives to actively think as a real programmer.
