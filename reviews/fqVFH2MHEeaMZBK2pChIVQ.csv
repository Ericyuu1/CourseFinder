Each week, each class equips a student with a practical instrument that enables them to master the art of public speaking. This course provides valuable tangible knowledge on how to structure, arrange, style, prepare and deliver a speech step by step. Such knowledge in turn builds a foundation of confidence. Although the fear of public speaking is rated highly in polls worldwide, I believe that the instruments, the approach, and the knowledge I learned in this class will enable me to conquer that fear once and for all as long as I follow the guidelines and practice.
