116925135~COURSE!~GuAIe0ScEe2teBK0oFBFtQ,1668563133343,1,0,"worst course ever. Terrible accent. After i finish the quiz, i don't know where i did wrong because the stupid teacher disabled the feedback function. I tried to tick randomly but the result is always 73% correct. This is a serious techinical fault. Even if i did 100% correct or 100% incorrect the result is always 73% correct hence fail (the respiratory part). Wasted my precious time.
