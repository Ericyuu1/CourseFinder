83020111~COURSE!~VvbwL3Z-Eeeobg7O-NRcDA,1676630117965,1,0,"Worst course ever. I am very desappointed with Coursera's lack of quality control.- It way too outdated: made in 2017 and not updated. For example, the link of the reading of ¡2014! about Tesla: ""The Tesla IoT Car"" by Anna Luo | AUGUST 21, 2014 | https://blogmitcnc.org/2014/08/21/the-tesla-iot-car-case-study/ - The delivery is poor. The professor reads a script. The videos lacked of visual aids.- The lessons are not structured, the script is not clear and the professor rarely gets to the point. - The transcriptions of the lessons are full of errors. For example, instead of ""chat bots"" it is written ""Check bots"", there are sentences written 2 times, there are parts that are not transcripted and you can read ""[inaudible]"".

This was disappointing to say the least. The videos lacked visual aids. The visual aids were few and far between. There was almost zero engagement in the forums. No one actually responded to a peer. Student participation was absent as was the professors. The graded assignment was not well designed. Instructions limited. Peer review was a chore. I had to solicit peers to review my assignment in order to receive a grade to complete the course. Overall, the content and optional readings were helpful in building knowledge in the area of digital transformation/new technologies. Having said that, links to YouTube videos were broken and outdated. Some of the readings no longer existed online!  The delivery was poor and not what I was expecting. I did not expect zero engagement in open discussion. The platform and how it was executed did not offer an engaging and stimulating environment. At the end of the course students were encouraged to connect with the professor on linkedin but you cannot without his personal email which was not provided. Doesn't seem right or again, engaging. I would not recommend this learning platform if you want deep learning experience. ",0,2,David Silvestri,75952520
