52392326~COURSE!~QQVzGrY7EeWbNBLZhfEI2Q,1643217340747,3,0,"This is an interesting course, on a rivetting, if tragic, topic. However, we noticed a few flaws. The parts about writing a memo and about islam are off-topic and/or of not much use. The confusion or assimilation of islamist thinking and muslim theory is not warranted. More would have been needed on the sociology and criminology of the groups who see themselves as representing a version of islam, and on the possible strategies on both sides of the war against terror.",0,0,Fred Vacelet,52392326
93109116~COURSE!~QQVzGrY7EeWbNBLZhfEI2Q,1642455732674,4,0,"If anything this class dispels all of the conspiracy theories.  It's worth taking based off of that dynamic alone. David is humble, passionate and knowledgeable about this topic.  Be ready for regular student undergraduate type reading assignments.  I like the grading system of presenting something other than a regular multiple choice exam.  It was a fantastic change.  Don't take this course unless you are retired or have a good bit of time on your hands due to the heavy amounts of reading.  It best to take while you are in between jobs and looking for something to do.  Can be stressful if you are a student or have a full time job. I did not mind the reading myself, yet I'm explaining to everyone the commitment you must make time wise.  I now want to come up to Durham and visit to hear David in a workshop or symposium. This course makes me want to do that even more.  Another 'grand slam' Coursera, Duke.  I'll miss both of you.",0,0,John C Brown ,93109116

I thought that the assessments for the course were really interesting. However, I didn't like that the assessments were peer marked and only marked by one other person as I think there was a variation in how much people understood what we were asked to do and so the marks weren't always fair and accurate.",0,0,Eilidh McNaughton,51872712

This understanding will affect how we deal with future cases and grievances. The material was excellent and the readings were very applicable. Dr Shanzer presented his course in an excellent manner and in an engaging way. My only ask would be that the material be brought up to 2021. Thank you!,0,0,Alan M Dawes,74936517

Really helped me gain an insight into what radicalization actually is, how it happens and how it is nothing like what the media in my country tell me it is like. Manageable deadlines and I did this alongside studying for my A-Level examinations which is in essence a full time job. The certificate was affordable at £36 and I now have something to put on my personal statement when applying for university. Would strongly recommend for people wanting some further understanding of what is a major historical event or just people who want something fun to do to broaden world understanding. Suitable and relevant for people across the world not just US citizens as I am from the UK and took great benefits from the course.",0,2,Isaac Ian Muirhead,75315179
