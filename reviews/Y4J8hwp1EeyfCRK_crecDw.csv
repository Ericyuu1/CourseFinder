I do recommend going through Dr. Cutrone's other calculus courses first, since there's a few discontinuities in the course flow. Those who are new to calculus might struggle a bit.

113502468~COURSE!~Y4J8hwp1EeyfCRK_crecDw,1665675937185,5,0,"I​t is one of the best courses in what is described on the syllabus. The teaching material is quite well organized providing amazing learning process in Python programming with Sympy. The first week a brief introduction to Numpy is provided with emphasis on what is important from Python programming to remember. It is not an introductory course neither in Python nor in mathematics.The course gives a first idea on how the differential and integral calculus can be applied in business economics and in the training on numerical computations either by hand or by algorithm writing. Further, it gives a good understanding in numbers rounding that is important in computations. After each video lecture before the quizzes there is review theory and several short examples on programming for personal improvement. Thanks John-Hopkins University for this interesting skillset.
