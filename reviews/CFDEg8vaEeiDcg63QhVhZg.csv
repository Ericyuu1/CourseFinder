39821380~COURSE!~CFDEg8vaEeiDcg63QhVhZg,1564265058394,5,0,"This third course in the Computational Thinking for K-12 Educators follows the same general pattern as the two before it:  solid videos that simply and thoroughly detail the topics, excellent activities to help foster deeper understanding and helpful tips that predict where k-12 students will have trouble and what to do about it.  These courses have many strengths but what I find most beneficial is that the simultaneously train me to be both a better coder AND a better coding teacher.  Well worth the time!",0,0,Margaret Macalister,39821380
