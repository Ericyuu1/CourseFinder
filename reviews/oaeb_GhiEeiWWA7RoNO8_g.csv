This method has helped me a lot in learning Mandarin. My recommendation for those who want to get more on the course is that you practice the vocabulary words a lot so you don't forget their meaning. ,0,0,才卜文Сергей,91048244

The grammar points explanation is acceptable but could be better with more examples. I can't really understand the peer review at the end... it would be much better to have (in addiction) a ""professional"" evaluation from the course instructors. After all the certification is not free of charge and a native chinese instructor would need just a couple minutes to evaluate such a short talk.Overall a nice experience, I'll try the orher courses in the specialization 4/5 stars ",0,1,Luca,12416205

4852111~COURSE!~oaeb_GhiEeiWWA7RoNO8_g,1557840134616,4,0,"This course was very helpful in continuing my Chinese studies. I loved the real life application of the lessons. The one thing I don't like is the peer review in order to pass the class. After doing this, it became clear to me that many people are on different levels in regards to their Chinese ability. I'm not sure a peer review is the best way to grade if someone did well in the class or not. Someone who has a very limited ability would find it difficult to properly grade someone with a much higher proficiency. It's very possible that people receive low scores due to others' lack of vocabulary, proper pronunciation, or grammar. While I think a peer review is okay, since I'm paying to complete the course, the least a professor could do is take the time to review my final submission and give me real feedback on what areas I need to improve in and what areas I'm strong in. That way I can know for sure that I'm receiving the grade I earned rather than a grade based off of another student's ability to understand. ",0,14,Kelly Pratt,4852111
25264150~COURSE!~oaeb_GhiEeiWWA7RoNO8_g,1542605877276,4,0,"Dear Instructors and Coursera team,after finishing the Beginner`s Course in Hello Chinese, I was excited to receive an E-mail announcing the Intermediate part course. The structure fits my learning needs, so I am totally content.One star is missing in my rating. I do miss some more grammar practices, which are not dependent on the current lesson. To me, it would be very helpful to do more excercises, where I have to tranfer the new skills to unknown sentences. However, you cannot match the interests of all learners, so I consider it not as a major issue.The parts in which Anna explains new grammar could be a little longer to help the knowledge to settle ""deeper in the brain"".Overall great job with just minor flaws in my view! Thanks for offering the course!Stephan",0,1,Stephan Rietz,25264150
