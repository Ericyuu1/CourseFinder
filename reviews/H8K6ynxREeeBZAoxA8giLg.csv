I did my work, but because there weren't other students also taking the course I was delayed in progressing (and charged $63 per month!)",0,0,Michelle Morrison,36177162

66454771~COURSE!~H8K6ynxREeeBZAoxA8giLg,1609168406410,5,0,"I liked the content of this course - I think it was the best among the 7 courses on Patient Safety Specialization.  I found the instructors very engaging and examples provided were very practical.  On the downside though, it would be beneficial if feedback provided particularly for the Graded Assignments would be more constructive.  I also encountered difficulties with grading my peers because I found some submissions not to be aligned to what was being asked - sometimes it was as simple as following instructions.  It was also frustrating that course could not be completed because there were no submissions to review, which was obviously not the learner's fault. As for the discussion forum, most were just appeals to rate their submissions, which was really not helpful at all.  I look forward to applying what I have learned to our setting.",0,0,Teresita Castillo,66454771
