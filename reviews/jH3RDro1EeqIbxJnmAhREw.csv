72920433~COURSE!~jH3RDro1EeqIbxJnmAhREw,1605081191622,2,0,"Really like the learning method and this was my first guided project on Coursera. However I felt very frustrated because I can't watch the video alone and have to constantly press the zoom button just so I don't see the rhyme window. Rhyme window was also quite slow and would often lag so it affected how fast I can make changes along with the instructor. The video is also outdated because Google Analytics now requires the existence of a website prior to making a property so we can't locate the gtag code. Not a bad course, just needs to be updated along with Google's changes.",0,2,Clarence Abiera,72920433
77727507~COURSE!~jH3RDro1EeqIbxJnmAhREw,1607787283915,3,0,"                 This course took far more time than expected.
Trying to follow the instructor on ""code script"", was not expected
and costs a lot of time, paper notes and video pauses. Additionally this script was not completely functional as you are
able to watch the results in Analytics, few days later. Therefore we spend huge time focusing on script, for almost no reason. After all, on final tasks about Goals and Conversions, my Cloud Desktop has
expired and I was forced to keep paper notes. About content: there is an error
on Task5, line 74 (time06:35 on the video) which is obviously missing in
Analytics (time08:34) Event Label. Took me more than an hour to find what was
wrong there. I do not rate with 2 stars, because I appreciate the knowledge and
the instructor. Just please try to keep the videos and schedule updated.    ",0,3,Constantinos Vassilakis,77727507
75030090~COURSE!~jH3RDro1EeqIbxJnmAhREw,1604111494107,3,0,"This needs to be updated because the software/layout shown has changed. This might not have been as much of an impediment to learning the basics if it weren't for the fact that I was required to log in to my own Google account and not preset one. But because what I was using was different I couldn't find some things the instructor was showing us because they had been changed/removed or moved to other sections. Also, there was some kind of distortion, like this was being recorded over a webcam, which made it difficult to understand the instructor at times and turning on closed captioning didn't help because the subtitles were sometimes translated as gibberish. It's not that the course was bad, it's that it was hard to follow because of these issues.",0,3,Mark Johnson,75030090
