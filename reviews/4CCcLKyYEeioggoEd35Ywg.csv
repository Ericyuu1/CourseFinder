I have a B.S. in biotech and I am going for my master's right now. I've taken a lot of courses in the life sciences. The content was very boring and confusing. That is probably in large part because immunology has very confusing terminology compared to something like biochemistry.

I would suggest working with people who are experts at visual presentation of information. People who make science documentaries, and people who can put together some inexpensive but visually appealing animations that make sense.

At the end of the day, it's not enough for professors to understand immunology. That information has to be conveyed to students in a way that is readily understandable.",0,0,Gregory Muhs,60444796

Prof. Novotny knows her subject very well and she is a teacher at heart - not so common among scientists.The problem is that she goes into all the details of the subject. but fails to present the overall picture. So you learn all the details of gene rearrangement of the T cells, but at the end you find yourself confused as to the the general workings of the whole system, B cells, T cells, complement system etc. Sure, the information is buried somewhere, but it is buried under so many details that it is hard to see the wood from all the trees.
