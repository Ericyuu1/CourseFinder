59494051~COURSE!~5GGrGM6fEeuv8RLqjtEE6Q,1655153460305,1,0,"I'm sure the marterial on the whole is informative, however students should be given the option like in the courses to buy the certificate at the end of the course, instead of ""we'll only grade you exams if you pay us"".this course was a waste of time for me, & I don't recommend it.",0,3,Brian Hayes,59494051
111761607~COURSE!~5GGrGM6fEeuv8RLqjtEE6Q,1675508042952,3,0,"Good course on suicide prevention. The pace of the speaker isn't too fast and there are enough images to understand the context.I feel like this course could be better if it is more focused on psychological prevention and what's going on in the individuals' mind. Only a few lessons cover the topic (Like Three Step Theory). It's more like a course that goes through all helping material for suicide instead of a psychologic class, which I initially anticipated by looking at the profile of the speaker.Would recommend to take this course if you have enough free time, but not entirely aimed for the psychological factor of suicide.",0,0,Joshua Choi,111761607
74761973~COURSE!~5GGrGM6fEeuv8RLqjtEE6Q,1650910570558,3,0,"There was a lot of good information here. However, i​n the middle of one of the intervention videos, there is a long discussion about the script that could easily have been cut from the video. Additionally, some of the links to videos are not working, especially in the last module.I​ know links particularly are hard to keep current, but the video should have that piece cut out, it's clearly an editing mistake. It makes me think that not a lot of attention was paid to this course, and considering the subject matter, that's a shame.",0,3,Amanda Cotten,74761973
87454060~COURSE!~5GGrGM6fEeuv8RLqjtEE6Q,1648148410302,3,0,"I thought the course was okay, not a lot of in-depth interventions like I had hoped for, it was more of an overview of suicide, and I thought a bit too much focus on the history and statistics. The week four 12 minute video needs to be edited, there are about 2 minutes of dead space and the two of the video links for that module do not work.",0,0,Sarah Ali,87454060

36610851~COURSE!~5GGrGM6fEeuv8RLqjtEE6Q,1673277155546,4,0,Its very Informative and a lo to learn. I will suggest to add some case studies to be analyzed such as clinical suicide cases. I know that's not in the scope of this course but  it could be kept optional.,0,1,Mohammad Sheraz Akbar,36610851
114764374~COURSE!~5GGrGM6fEeuv8RLqjtEE6Q,1667219586910,4,0,"I​ do a PhD study on language and suicide, and even I got positevely surprised by this course, because I learned so many new, relevant things! Another plus for me is the online quizzes with unlimited attempts to pass, since the main goal is to learn, not to be tested in a traditional “pass now or never”. The care for scientific evidence and clear explanations is another pro on this course. It’s worth noting that the teacher gives plenty of examples, so you can quickly visualize what she said.I just don’t give it 5 stars because there were no real pictures or videos on the presentations, only diagrams, charts and the like. Anyways, most of the time, it was text over white background plus the teacher’s voice and image. At some point, my brain got bored and I had to force myself more and more to study something I like, so I figured the problem was not lack of interest. I don’t mean there should be suicide pictures and videos, but objects like a handshake when talking about support, a smiling health professional, maybe photos of some researchers etc.",0,0,Roger Vinícius da Silva Costa,114764374

Week 1 the graphs were difficult to read as the colors were too similar in the graphic. There was no guidance for the discussion forum. Several links did not work for the assignments. One of the videos, very awkwardly, included a conversation with someone off camera that was not edited out (when discussing the ""No Suicide Contract"". ",0,0,Megan,82047548

86036287~COURSE!~5GGrGM6fEeuv8RLqjtEE6Q,1664139971441,5,0,"I like it so much. Researchers often talk and complain  misconceptions about suicide in social sphere but do not talk about their stubborn persistence in their own misconceptions. This course has done a great job with the touching the  clinicians' acceptance of ""normal"" and persist their attitude to continue their blatant errors, such as the suicide contract's iatrogenic effects. I wish there were more courses on the topic of suicide. I would be very happy to see a collaborative course of interdisciplinary researchers here.",0,0,furkan çabuk,86036287

34482445~COURSE!~5GGrGM6fEeuv8RLqjtEE6Q,1637581371930,5,0,"I like that the course keeps the modules brief and to-the-point. It gives learners plenty of space to process all the information, and the way it was put together allows that information to be retained for longer and more clearly. I enjoyed the readings and the activities suggested as well. However, some links in the readings are no longer functional and need updating. Also, in the last module, there is one video in which the professor pauses to fix some mistakes in the text with her coworkers, and I think that segment should be removed from the video. A great, well-designed, and insightful course overall!",0,0,Andrée Khoury,34482445
