28289060~COURSE!~10W6Te_sEea7DBK-0BPzLg,1517573296052,2,0,"Overall, I am not wowed by this program. The multiple projects angle was helpful, but could have been added to the previous three courses as most of it was repetitive. The team project was simply a mess. While I understand the point was to work with a virtual team, with the global classmates and the fact that we are all working adults with varied schedules caused far more frustration than needed.",0,5,Lauren Rauchwarter,28289060

40587172~COURSE!~10W6Te_sEea7DBK-0BPzLg,1612763410653,5,0,"This final course Project Practicum with Multiple Projects was useful. However, it helped to better understand what it means by Managing Multiple Projects and provides confidence to the Project Manager to manage any single or multiple  projects without any  fear.  Though, several exercises completed throughout this course constitute the fundamental and the backbone of the success in the profession of the PM. Finally, the Instructor contributes a lot for the success of the Course.Again thanks a lot to Coursera, UCI and the enthusiastic course instructor, Shelly.

28382601~COURSE!~10W6Te_sEea7DBK-0BPzLg,1575282822287,5,0,From the 4 courses this final one probably is the best. I like the hands one applied project management aspect very much. It cements the knowledge gain previously and turns it into skill. The additional aspect of being in a virtual team worked out well. It can be somewhat stressful but also very rewarding as it matched reality as best as it can. ,0,0,Jan Rhebergen,28382601
