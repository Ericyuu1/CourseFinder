77780465~COURSE!~dTCK9ETfEeaDRhLb8lAaNw,1609430943627,1,0,"I am quitting this specialization/courses. The presentations were very light on actual information/teaching. I tried skipping ahead to see if there was something more meaningful about solving complex problems, and, while I did not check all the courses and modules, I didn't find much that seemed helpful to me. Honestly, the first parts seemed very set on promoting evolutionary theory.",0,1,Daniel Hamilton,77780465

It was more of an exposure to big history and a few big problems.",0,0,dh,34734858

41139489~COURSE!~dTCK9ETfEeaDRhLb8lAaNw,1584881179173,4,0,"The course and the teachers are really good. The material is very impressive. If you combine the four courses and choose a good topic, than every step leads to more and better understanding.However, the peer grading aspect of this course isn't really working. I must have scored over thirty assignments before my own assignment got scored. There are probably more than thirty other studentes waiting for their final grade - the longest wait I encountered was 34 months.Sure, if not many students follow the course at the same time, then it gets tougher to grade the assignments - I was lucky that it only took a month longer.",0,0,FJ Kist,41139489
