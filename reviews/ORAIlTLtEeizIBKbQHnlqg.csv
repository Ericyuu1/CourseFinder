Nevertheless, I experienced my first frustration with this course. And my frustration grew exponentially with the amount of time wasted.
(1) the first problems relate to the Theia tool and the very approximate support. And since the final submission is a Dashboard, I spent a few days installing my own tools. And trying to find a solution to submit my Jupyter notebook and run it. Typically Github and MyBinder*.
(2) On the last day, I discover that the final submission consists of ""screenshots"". I wonder how such a bad idea could ""germinate"". The questions are confusing. It took me a little while to understand what the teacher wanted. Overall, I spent more time preparing the answers than writing the code.
In reviewing the submissions of other students, I found that many had not understood the questions. One of the students got a 0, for submitting his Jupyter Notebook pdf to all questions. My frustration escalated.
-------
There is an urgent need to redesign the submission process for this course! Either a Jupyter notebook on IBM Watson, or on Github with MyBinder* for the execution. The submission and correction process will be greatly improved.

Thanks for reading me.

As a course on data visualization, it should focus primarily on how to VISUALIZE the data. In other words, when we have the processed and formated data, how can we turn it into plots. But in the videos, especially week 2, the instructor over and over again repeated the data processing for Canadian immigration. After watching the videos, what I remember most clearly is not how to make the plots but the total number of immigrants to Canada from each country. And for the most important part, that is, the details of how to generate the plots as well as applying various features, the instructor just spent very little time in the videos. Yes, a lot of them are covered in the lab, but remember that for a course, the lab should just be supplementary of the lecture. The instructor should teach those skills systematically in the VIDEOS, and the lab should only be used to reinforce our understanding of those skills. In particular, as has been mentioned in many comments, the final assessment requires using the artist layer which was only introduced a little bit in the lecture but NEVER taught in detail. This is not responsible behavior. Overall, I am very disappointed. And I hope that IBM can ask another instructor other than Alex Aklson to create a new version of this course.

No explanation, just: this is how it is, live with it. Secondly, they changed from Jupyter to an IDE based on THEIA. It is horrible, impossible to view your code as a whole, full of bugs and hard to navigate. Just scrolling in it was like a course on its own. In week 5 you get the biggest shock of all: the final assignment is solely based on the work that wasn’t explained to you, in an IDE that makes you want to pull your hair out. I struggled for a day and a half with the assignment. Most of the time was spent battling with the IDE. I had to reopen it at least a dozen times (frozen, files won’t open), and that is when you learn the hard way that all your work gets wiped out when you do. So, copy and paste your work in Word or GitHub, you will need it. There is also an error in the code provided by them. I’m not sure if that was part of the assignment, but it seems very cruel.

The final assignment grading also wasn't well conceived. The way the guidelines/questions were asked were very unclear, so sometimes you didn't see what you actually needed to upload until you had already taken the screenshot or submitted the assignment. This carried over into the grading--there were times the directions said to remove points if certain things weren't present on a student's answer, but then as a grader you actually didn't have the ability to remove points for that reason.

The very first lecture focuses around efficient 'less-is-more' figure design, which I certainly agree with.  However, much of the course (and most of the tested material) focuses on making extraneous graphics such as waffle charts and chloropleth maps in situations where a simple bar graph would be the most efficient way to present data.  Meanwhile, the standard module Seaborn (which is EXTREMELY expansive in data visualization utility) is given only a single 2 minute lecture.  Second, unlike all other courses I have taken in the IBM certification, the assignments and workshop sections of this course are largely unhelpful.  In addition to my point above, the workshops focus on manipulating aesthetics of simple graphics (i.e. changing colors in a bar graph)  as opposed to showcasing the broad number of figures that Python is capable of generating.  This left me disappointed with what I took away from the course in terms of usable knowledge.Finally, the final assignment is arduous and poorly documented.  There is no structured notebook that provides guidance on solving the problems, which is particularly troublesome when rendering uncommon figures such as chloropleth maps.  I found that I spent >80% of my time on the assignment chasing down unintelligible error messages, as opposed to developing a real understanding of the logic behind generating graphics in Python.

I think the purpose of this course (visualizing data) and the different ways of doing it is really motivating and awesome, specially when you realize all the things you can do (types of charts , maps etc...). This is actually awesome! However, on the down sides: -Each video repeats the steps on how the database used in each course has been ""cleaned"". I agree with the feedback from other people, reminding us one or two times is fine, but in each video... This is too much!-I would have liked more practical exercises, specially to plot multiple linear regression models (and polynomial of different degrees, in particular), to display on a chart, and to make predictions. That would be great ! -Labs: they are of unequal difficulty: some are relatively easy to complete, some require more  thinking/research and time, while some have no question at all or very little. Maybe it would be useful to re-organize the labs ?...-Week 3: as everyone mentions, the ""artist layer"" method is only briefly covered in one of the lab. It would have be really useful to spend more time on it, and on all the things we do with it. Like others, I spent lot of time searching online, and it took me a full afternoon to complete that part of the final assignment !To summarize: it's a very important and interesting course, but video lessons should be re-recorded with deleting all parts repeating the initial database processing, and adding more topics such as artist layers, etc. Also, maybe split each lab in 2 since there are few labs in this course, but if we follow them correctly, it requires quite few hours to spend on each lab (at least for ""beginners"" like us starting learning about this topic).Thank You !",0,0,Louis JULIENNE,44370045

Importing the data could be done simply using the Pandas library, whose functions somewhat overlaps with the Matplotlib library. 
Although in the last week, the author introduces the Folium library, which is a library to visualize Maps and other related things that could be shown on the Maps, like the population density of different cities in a country, the main focus of the course is on the Pandas library, which is, of course, need that lots of attention and time. 
In summary, this course is especially helpful for those who want to become familiar with the Pandas library. 
The author also gives a very short amount of time to show how seaborn could be used to plot the regression plots using seaborn.regplot function, which is also showing wise time management by the author since it does not need more amount of time to spend on.

I wrote them very upset because I did Not get at 1st time the results expected as I  use to. Sorry for that.!!! Said that; I want to give you a feedback in order to improve the courses yet to come. It is Ok when teachers show you the A, B, C of any topic and then, expect from you with the final assignment the students´ showing the the X, Y and Z of that topic in question. I do not have any problem with that. I fact I remember at The University the the teachers did exactly that. The diference is, they did explain those expectations at the very begining of the course. This course is far from copy or paste code as someone said on the Forum, but although all of you were very diligents with the doubts, mistakes we made, the problem with the Jupyter lab, etc. I think that you should had explain better the A, B, C of the course making the Quizes more challenging since the begining.

It was when I needed to create charts for my job and I was actually working with Python to do those assignments that the concepts in this course finally clicked. Once they did, I was able to push past the finish line. With this happening, I remembered the important truth of coding skill: it's like a muscle. It only grows when you exercise it. That said, I wish this course offered more exercises (perhaps ungraded FYI exercises, or expanded lab work) in creating various charts. The maps section rocked! That was, I think, my favorite part of the course, especially when creating the choropleth map for crime in San Francisco. I remember when I did GIS projects in my work 25 years ago, when specialized software ($15,000 - $20,000 per license) was required. Now, in just lines of Python code, you can create an even more precise map. Once I complete my certificate for data science in Python, I will be looking for GIS courses available at Coursera!

I liked how the labs really explored different options and played around with the code in a variety of ways to show a more complete picture of what the code instances can do.  I especially liked how sometimes the labs would purposely use incorrect code which users might enter, and then explain why that code didn't apply or work for given scenarios.  I liked how the videos (specifically regarding Canada dataset) would repeat the cleansing of the data and introduction of the data for each type of plot because it really reinforced the concept, however it could have been better if the corresponding code were displayed alongside its effects instead of just showing its effects because then it would drive home the code and the concept instead of just the concept.I also liked the fact that the final project asked students to make connections beyond the individual class scope, as a way of teaching that mimics real-world projects and learning.",0,5,Stephen Peterson,37964334
