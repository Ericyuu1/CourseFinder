Moreover, I feel that categorizing this course as a ""beginner"" course is somewhat questionable, as a complete beginner will face a lot of hurdles, given the number of new topics introduced in each lecture, the succeeding (often difficult) assignment, and the brevity of explanation. This course is more of an intermediate level, and some prior experience of Multivariate Calculus is required.

Both courses so far would really benefit from another couple turns at the wheel in terms of polish, making sure that concepts are covered adequately and nothing is lost in the gaps. Also there is room for more and better 'further reading' pointers for those who are interested.The biggest issue in both courses so far is the discontinuity when the lecturers (for whatever reason) switch in the last 2 weeks of the respective courses. Things seem to get lost or forgotten. For example, in this course there's no mention in week 5 of how the previous week's topic relates to the material being covered, even though in the assignment there is a very interesting application of the topics in week 4 being presented, but it's completely hidden. And, judging from the forum posts from that week, the vast majority of students missed that insight.  I'm not sure why this course hasn't received any updates since it launched over 2 years ago.

At the same time, some other explanations were on the obvious side, so I'd say the instructions are kind of inconsistent in their difficulty. The real-life examples were relly good though. The same concerns the quizzes, some are absolutely great and intuitive, while the others just leave you puzzled about what you are even expected to do with no extra info offered when failed.  The course is kind of sloppier than the first one and the reviews say the third one is even worse, so I won't be doing it.

It may not necessarily go deep enough to make you an expert in solving  problems in multivariate calculus that might be seen at the university level; rather, it  goes just deep enough to enable you to understand  how multivariable calculus operates in various machine learning scenarios. Some of these scenarios include: (1) The process of backpropagation in basic neural networks. (2) Using the Newton-Raphson method to find the roots of a function in the multivariate case.(3) Use of the Taylor series to approximate a function in the multivariate case, and how such an approximation can be used for optimisation. (4) Using gradient descent to reach the nearest minimum points in the parameter space, so as to optimise the parameters in a machine learning model with multiple parameters.T​he quizzes provide a few example problems for us to work on, but as mentioned earlier, they are of the more basic variety; it is quite unlikely that undergraduate courses have examples that are this straightforward. However, I feel that this is a good thing, given that their aim is only to allow us to get a feel for multivariable calculus without bogging us down with needless complexity. T​he overall aim of the course is to build intuition, which I think it accomplishes.H​owever, compared to the previous course in this specialization, it is harder to draw the links between the material that is covered in one week as compared to the next. It is harder to see how they are related, and how the material for each week fits into the overall picture. This was not the case in the previous course. The concepts from the previous weeks would be seemlessly integrated into those from the current week. There seems to be an unspoken expectation that the course participant should refer to external resources to fill in the blanks, and find the coherence within the material by themselves. I feel that the course instructors can do better at integrating the concepts taught across the weeks, so that it does not feel quite so fragmented. ",0,0,Kaushal K. Kaslikar,25966819

I did not need any background knowledge of python, because I only needed to write arithmetical equations, pretty much using python as a calculator. In that way I had a chance to focus on the subject matter while leaving python do all the calculations.
