6319789~COURSE!~MTVdFqgyEeWbLRJn4j8c4Q,1627299520045,1,0,Way too much advanced statistics. This course is meant for those who have a PhD in statistics.,0,2,Dr. Bharath Sampath Kumar,6319789
32751016~COURSE!~MTVdFqgyEeWbLRJn4j8c4Q,1525312355141,2,0,Lot of information. Almost no useful instruction. I saw that the instructors knew about lots of cool things. I did not learn how to do any of those cool things.,0,3,Jordan Miller-Ziegler,32751016

875457~COURSE!~MTVdFqgyEeWbLRJn4j8c4Q,1483473604515,3,0,Pretty good lectures that touch on many aspects of fmri but doesn't really get into enough details to really learn about the difficulties with this methodology.   Would be nice if they had some real data processing exercises to demonstrate someof the concepts.,0,2,Richard Kennan,875457
25521106~COURSE!~MTVdFqgyEeWbLRJn4j8c4Q,1666590116626,4,0,"I​ think this is a great course for an overview of fMRI in experimental studies. I love how the course makes fMRI analyses engaging and mostly digestable. The fact that they return to the same fMRI pipeline over multiple modules makes it really reinforce some of the central themes of conducting fMRI experiments. I find that Tor Wager gives great examples from real research studies.  Though Martin Linquist is obviously a brilliant statistician, I think he often gets too technical and glosses over jargon too quickly. This makes it difficult to learn. I've had trouble sometimes keeping up with the material when certain jargon is not spelled out always. I was also hoping to see real fMRI data in some sort of programming software that might make it a bit more hands on. Though, this is a good introductory course if you are already familiar with statistics, and have read a handful of fMRI papers. It may be too technical to people who are completely new to fMRI. All in all, great work.",0,0,Harley Glassman,25521106

3495558~COURSE!~MTVdFqgyEeWbLRJn4j8c4Q,1589850249945,4,0,The course assignments were bit easy and it would be good to provide more thought provoking exercises. The explanations by Dr. Tor Wager was unsatisfactory many a times. The course can be made practical oriented where the students get to implement the algorithms learnt.  Overall the course was good in giving a broad overview of various topics. ,0,0,Anirban Sengupta,3495558

The only downside for me were the mathematical parts by Martin which got complex, messy and seemed to be explained not as clear as in previous course.
