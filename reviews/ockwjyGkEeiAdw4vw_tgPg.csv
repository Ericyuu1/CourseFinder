85575452~COURSE!~ockwjyGkEeiAdw4vw_tgPg,1629812659443,1,0,"I felt that this course started out pretty easily. It covered basic things in probability / statistics. I felt at the start of the course it was an okay fit for me since I already knew what it was talking about. But that changed pretty abruptly.Assignments were not very useful in building a solid understanding of python using pandas. Almost all of the code was there for you. And sometimes they were just ""Look at this code and see what it does"". There's not very much hands on learning which is important for solid retention.With these in mind, I really don't understand who the target audience was supposed to be here exactly. It seems like you should know both some Python and Statistics before taking this course. Probably more than the intermediate level. I think that could have been fixed if this was a Specialization instead of a single course. I think that is where the issue lies. If things were expanded into multiple courses, this concept and course could have worked better.I ended up abandoning working on this course in Week 3 and shifted to two Specializations on Python and one on Statistics.

38655880~COURSE!~ockwjyGkEeiAdw4vw_tgPg,1547969399760,1,0,"„ÄêNow you know Prof. Xuhu Wan, please avoid his course in HKUST„Äë0. Course EquivalenceüòêThis course basically covers 50% content of MATH2411 Applied Statistics (I heard there is ISOM2500 that is similar to MATH2411?). Accidentally I took 2411 right before this winter when this course is out, so I found this course quite disappointing because I expect some practical manipulation of Python is covered while it doesn't. More is discussed in #3.  1. Teaching ‚òπIf you have the experience of recording a video presentation eight hours before the deadline, with scripts written three days before and you hadn't recited or even gone through it in these three days, you will find the professor the same unpassionate. You will find his tone flat enough and gestures unnatural enough as if he is not emphasizing on anything but focusing to recite his scripts. You will find him lag a lot at strange and unnatural spots as if his brain goes blank and he quickly reads the copy of scripts next to the camera.  I thought business people cares a lot about presentation, but I was wrong.  2. Subtitle üò°There are tons of me steaks in the subtitles, not only tipos but also worlds of cellar pronunciation.  (There are tons of mistakes in the subtitle, not only typos but also words of similar pronunciation.)  I enable subtitle because I sometimes can‚Äòt understand the professor's perfect Mainland accent, but it turns out the subtitle is on his side but not my side.   I thought business people are very strict about the material that comes along with their presentation, that they always carefully spellcheck every sentence. But I was wrong.  3. Content üòê3.1 Overall: Please rename this course ""Python and applied statistics"". The professor spends sooooo much time talking about the statistics concepts and spends soooo little time applying the knowledge to financial analysis. It is not about ""Statistics for Financial Analysis"". Replace the data he uses for demonstration with GPA of every student and it becomes ""Statistics for Being HKUST President"" or ""Statistics for Anything"". I feel I am taking an introduction course to statistics and financial analysis is just an excuse the teacher use to show us the content he teaches is somewhat useful.  3.2 Pace: You MAY find the pace quite fast because:     The teacher throws many statistics concepts     The teacher cannot fully explain the concepts (or it is not a 4 week course) so he moves on before you ever (perhaps never will) digest the previous concepts  This is extremely annoying in week 4, e.g. Multiple Linear Regression is taught without introducing a single formula, merely Python codes and black boxes behind them. (Actually this is the way I originally expect the professor to do, but it is quite inconsistent with the style in week 1-3)  You MAY find the pace quite slow because:     After all this course introduces formulas and codes and let you to use them without knowing why.   So I would say this is a 4-day course if you can spare 1 hour each day. After all you are not asked ""why"" but only ""how"". If you haven't taken MATH2411 or ISOM, you can spend more time on week 2 & 3 to understand the underlying knowledge. Week 1 is simple and week 4 is needless to comprehend.  4. Jupyter Notebook (JN for short) üò°4.1 Poor Exercise Almost useless. Just a copy of the codes appeared in the video, with some variables assigned None instead of the correct expression. Your job is to change the lines of variable assignment (usually one or two lines), and the rest is done for you. Some notebooks are even 100% done for you, and all you need to do is look at it and appreciate. Even if you are fiddling with provided exercises, you don't know how to use JN, because...  4.2 Irresponsible adoption of JN If you want to do some real exercise, you may want to append empty cells below the given content and type codes from scratch. But oh, this course does not teach you how to use JN! It just throw you a tutorial link of how to INSTALL JN ON YOUR COMPUTER{https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook}. What a shame!  Quickly gone through the linked tutorial, it assumes you have installed multiple instance of Python on your desktop, and know basics of pip, conda, docker, and virtual env, and teaches you how to install and configure JN in various dev. environments. But you just mentioned we can use Coursera's pre-installed JN out-of-the-box, why you want us to learn that huh? And to create cells, run cells, run several cells in order, run all, and other basic operations, is hidden in the last seconds of GIFs, not explicitly explained. I guess the professor is TOO UNRESPONSIBLE to not only teach students how to use JN himself, but also SPEND AT LEAST SOME TIME to check if the external tutorial really ""explains how to use Jupyter Notebooks"". Please, not every one taking this course is CS student like me, SBM students they may not know how to use Python stuff.  5. Coursera Technical üòêQuizzes do not provide correct answer. So it is not that helpful. But getting 80% is not that hard either. But given the assumption that you can't use JN (explained in #4.), you lose at least 10% in Quiz 3 and 20% in Quiz 4. Oh that hurts! (Since Notebook 4.4 is done for you, another 20% in Quiz 4 related to JN is okay.)",0,52,Zeyu HUANG,38655880

Below I will describe main pros ans cons of the course.To the benefits of this course I will attribute, firstly, its low entry threshold for beginners. Secondly, it was quite close to practice: methods of munging the data, visualizing the data, building simple trading signals with the help of Pandas library methods as well as evaluating the strategy with Sharpe Ratio and Maximum Drawdown coefficients will be very useful in real life and I hope will safe many hours of exploring technical issues in Stack Overflow and similar resources. Thirdly, the structure of the course was very intuitive: we had an overview of main statistical concepts before we needed to apply them to real data.As to the drawbacks of the course, first of all, the overwiew of statistical concepts was too superficial. The listeners who don't have previous statistical, economic or engineering background will certainly have a lot of questions unanswered because they won't go to the proofs of the concepts and ideas presented. Secondly, though we've built trading strategies, they can not be applied in real life because we've not touched such topics as trading fees modelling and bid-ask spread modelling. Thirdly, I don't understand how the signals we have created may be technically applied in a trading environment as we didn't bother these questions.To sum up, it was quite good introductionary course to the signal-based trading with the help of statistics. However, I think it should be further developed to cover more practical aspects and suggest different ways for listeners to improve their expertiese in the field of trading and quantitative finance, for example, by links to other courses in this sphere.",0,0,–ì–ª–µ–± –í–æ–ª–æ–¥–∏–Ω,74223185

The videos, along with the subtitles at the bottom of the page, were clear and easy to understand.  The exercises were a little disappointing in my opinion. I believe the best way to learn most programming language is to type out the code from scratch and test at every step as you go along. I understand that some sections of the code we used to the analysis were complex, so my suggestion is to only include those parts of the code in the exercises, and have the student type out the easy parts repeatedly. For example the from excel, print, head, tail  and other easy code can be filled out by the students instead of already having it in place. This will really help nail down the syntax and nuances of the language. You can include a help button that shows the correct code if the students can't figure it out themselves.

The course is presented by the instructor who is an experienced data scientist and financial analyst, and he explains the concepts in a clear and easy-to-understand manner.The course covers a range of topics, including statistical analysis, time series analysis, and asset valuation. The course also teaches students how to use various Python libraries for financial analysis, such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.One of the things I appreciated most about this course is its practical approach. Throughout the course, the instructor provides real-world examples and exercises, which allows students to apply what they have learned in a meaningful way. The course also includes a capstone project, which requires students to use their new skills to analyze real financial data.The course is well-structured, and the lectures are organized in a logical and coherent manner.

95822575~COURSE!~ockwjyGkEeiAdw4vw_tgPg,1645888672453,5,0,"The course is well done. 
I appreciate that some minor things about Phyton are ommitted in order to explain the important things more rapidly.  
If you have never coded before (like me) and you want to follow this course seriosuly, understanding every line of code, then you have to do additional research online, to read for example the exact synthax of a certain method or function that is being used. I truly wish there was a follow up to this course, to go more in depth and to see more examples.

Sometimes the accent of the teacher and the wrong (english) subtitles can make it harder to understand certain part, one funny example is ""shot"" a stock instead of shorting it. Only in very few instances it actually made it tougher to understand certain parts as for example the verb-noun agreement was not easy to understand, english is not my first language so take what I said with a grain of salt as well! 
Thanks a lot for this course! Again, I really hope you decide to do a Part 2 ! I would enroll immediately

It is a very good course to learn the basics in python to analyze 
financial stock market data. However, if you don't have prior knowledge 
to statistics and financial data (variance, histograms, regressions, 
value at risk, hypothesis testing, ...), the course might be to fast to 
understand the background, because you cannot explain all these things 
properly in 2-3 hours of video. But I guess most people who want to 
analyze stock data in python have this knowledge.
