(Which is what I was looking for).U​nfortunately, for $10 it is overpriced. Really. I would be willing to pay $10 for even a wee bit more content that is more thoughtfully presented (editing, structure, transitions, compare/contrasts, better use of screen). And more content wouldn't necessarily translate into a longer course, but perhaps a stronger ""Get started with..."" and more tightly presented.",0,0,Steven P. Meyer,3450358
