The  required readings were not well selected  (23-page literature review!) or specified: ""explore this website"" - how much exploration is ""required""?  Some of the material presented in the videos was helpful as an overview but the assessment questions were atrocious!!  They seemed to be autogenerated by an algorithm selecting sentences from the video transcript or written by non-native speakers.   In the LD section in particular they were so far removed from the main learning objectives that the only thing they tested was your ability to go back and find the relevant sentence within the transcripts in the alloted time.
