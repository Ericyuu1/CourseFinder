Especially in ""weeks"" 3 and 4 when things get a bit more complex. If the teacher alone cannot provide more exercises, it would be very appreciated if he could suggest for every topic some other ones from another online source.

After completing the course, I feel like I have a better understanding of linear algebra but also that much more self-motivated learning will be required to gain even better understanding.There are several areas for improvement in the course content and also some additional things I would love to see as far as building upon this foundational course from Professor Chasnov:1) Professors Chasnov's teaching style is excellent and the use of the lightboard is impactful. Future courses taught in this way and style would be beneficial for students.2) Although the lecture content is great, the solutions to many of the follow-on exercises that required proofs were too condensed and didn't seem adequate with regards the rigorous steps required to prove things.3) The flow of video content going from vectors spaces to solving the least squares problem took a big conceptual leap that wasn't easily apparent to newcomers to linear algebra. I think there needs to be one more video prior to the discussion of the least squares problem designed to fill this gap.4) It would be great to have a follow-up course dedicated to four or five engineering and business problems and using the linear algebra tools from this course to solve those problems. This would solidify not only the concepts learned in this course but also why these concepts are critical and impactful to solving real world problems.5) It would be great to have another follow-up course dedicated to computer coding of the content from item 4 using a language like Python.6) Specifically, it would be great to have a course on machine learning and the critical role of linear algebra in the context of developing machine learning solution. This course would take smaller tasks within the broader machine learning solutions and demonstrate how to use linear algebra to tackle those tasks (for example PCA to perform dimensionality reduction).Thank you for an insightful class.Nick Jathar",0,7,Nikhil Jathar,22386121

Jeffrey‚Äôs explanation is very good. Easily understandable to learners.I am engineering graduate but I got some additional
knowledge of null space range space Lu decomposition methods.This course covers all about matrices, and briefly covers
the linear algebra that an engineer should know. Professor Jeffrey R. Chasnov (The
Hong Kong University of Science and Technology) described the Gaussian
elimination algorithm used to solve systems of linear equations and the
corresponding LU decomposition of a matrix. He explained concept of vector
spaces very well.  Ultimately Excellent course, thank you so much! This is fantastic
fact that the videos were backed by a comprehensive set lecture notes with problems
and solutions, including proofs. This made consuming the concepts much easier

At the same I think prospective students need to be aware of the amount of content covered and previous knowledge required. As I understand it, this Coursera offering covers half a semester of a second year university course. In other words it covers in one month what students cover in about two and a half months. And in the universiry syllabus, this course has math prerequisites. So while basic concepts are introduced, they are done so in a way that I found to imply previous familiarity. And once a concept is introduced,  the material assumes students understand and can manipulate it.  Whoosh! This course moves quickly.The prof is personable and lectures in an engaging manner. Lectures are well set out. It was great that he facilitates screen capture at the end of each lecture.The text and exercises are sparse but adequate. It is great to have both in pdf form included with the course. This comment is not to complain, but to encourage a little more filling out of details in the lectures and worked examples of the problem sets.In conclusion if you have completed senior high or secondary school math and are willing to put in the effort, or want a concise review of matrix algebra, this is a worthwhile course.",0,13,David Soknacki,14805531
