Due to the fact that there is so much and that this course is trying to account for the fact that there is a wide range of learners with various levels.The course says that it is fine for true beginners and I agree withe the sentiment overall but there was still a sizable amount to this course that left some things to be desired.For one, I personally felt that the course content for week 3 and week 4 should have been switched around. Also if you are a true beginner when it comes to computing languages, particularly C#. You should start with a course like that. I personally wish I had taken a C# class and then come here as it would have made the assignments far more digestible.The course quickly goes from teaching you how to walk, and then suddenly expects you to learn how to sprint. This is an unreasonable jump in expectations in my opinion, especially when the course markets itself as being suitable for true beginners and not requiring programming skills.This course is also taught partially by a TA. With that in mind, they are a TA and not a full fledged instructor so we can't expect that from them. However, the TA works a little too quickly and does not narrate what they are doing all the time and it can get easy to become lost if you are not constantly pausing and reviewing the lesson to see exactly what is happening step-by-step.Not a bad course, but it has a lot of room for improvement. Take a beginners C# course before coming to this one and expect a lot of pausing and reviewing if you are just starting out.",0,3,Richard Daniel Russell,47523696

There are some caveats however that I have to point out.- The lessons given by the TA (which are like a third of the course) are very confusing to follow and are of considerably less quality than the others. - The introduction to programming in C# was very rudimentary. - I""d have preferred the final project to be something simpler (say pong) but where you have more understanding of the mechanics you're working with. Like this it felt like re-skinning a game that is based on pre-written components made by others without knowing what you are really doing.Still I'd overally would recommend this course.",0,0,Moritz Geremus,9305373

It was taught by the TA who was using a different version of Unity, I also lost hours of work because of this. The TA also spoke fast and brushed over a lot of topics, making it difficult to understand.The part of the 2D shooter project that asked for 3 modifications was extremely difficult if you have never used Unity before (this class says it is for beginners for haven't used unity before). Most of the modifications asked for us to create our own artwork/music or use assets that were not provided to us. We were not shown how to create our own assets or find assets elsewhere. We also weren't shown how to add new behaviors that weren't provided to us or add things like powerups. People with expereince in Unity or other game engines were able to do this and make great games that had 3 or more modifications. However, those of us that are using Unity for the first time and are relying on what we are taught, were left with barely any modifications we knew how to do and our grades suffered for it. I would have loved to do several modifications and make a great game that followed the assignment but I just wasnt shown how.Overall I did enjoy the course and learned a lot!

I really dislike the Peer-Graded Assignment system. Yes, I learned a lot from my peers but I think there are some issues with the system. For example, I had a pretty good description of my project and I clearly had more than two screenshots but somehow my reviewers decided not to give me any points for it?

For the week 3-4 the 2d shooter project, it depends on what you want out of it.

Which is fine and useful. But if you want to make it more your own, just know you'll need to be prepared to scour the Unity manual, internet and any friends you have who code because there is almost zero instruction on how to do any C# scripting at this stage of the class.

The criteria for the peer reviews are objective, not subjective like (did this include two out of three build types)  One reviewer clearly made a mistake and marked one as wrong and there was no way ask that reviewer to look again, or report an inaccurate review to an instructor.The course was great, but the review process is annoying an can affect your grade.",0,2,Joe Zimmerman,32027212

However, instructions for building the actual game are delivered with much less clarify by the teaching assistant. He skims through important details while repeatedly mentions common knowledge as how to unzip a file or how to save a project. By the 3rd course (3D shooter), I still have no clue how to do vertex snapping consistently (the part where you hold V to line up edges between objects), and I just figured out myself how to scale an object uniformly (and no, it's not ""hold alt"" - it is ""hold alt after starting to scale the object).",0,1,Frank Pan,88288590
