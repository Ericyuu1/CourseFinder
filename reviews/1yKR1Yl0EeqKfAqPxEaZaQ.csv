92294224~COURSE!~1yKR1Yl0EeqKfAqPxEaZaQ,1635994580297,2,0,"the content is presented in a bullet manner without any deep dive into any algorithm. You can get a good overview of various models in DL and RL, but nothing in details. I would not recommend any DS to use this course as a learning module. But maybe it is quite suitable for people without data science background. Even though, the presentation is not interesting. Just read-out of bullet points for each model.",0,3,Rui Tan,92294224
76397458~COURSE!~1yKR1Yl0EeqKfAqPxEaZaQ,1627316630342,3,0,"This course has a larger scope than the other ML certificate courses and is a little out of date. While it introduces RL, it does not discuss TD learning or Deep RL. RL seems ""tacked on"". Similarly, there is a brief introduction to Attention, but no substantial discussion of Transformer models (I suggest dropping LSTM and talking just about Transformers). Unlike the other courses, which introduced the concepts and also covered practical steps on using these methods, the DL/RL course is a little light on the practical side of DL. There is little discussion of why particular architectures are chosen for specific problems or how sensitive those architectures are to various hyperparameters. You will know what DL, CNN, RNN (and to a lesser extent, RL) are is when you finish this course, but there's a big gap for any practical use of these tools, which was less of an issue for the (admittedly simpler/more scoped) topics in earlier courses.",0,1,R Wray,76397458

A few more practice labs on CNN and RNN would have been awesome!Cons : The only difficulty I found was with the english accent of our dear trainer. Sometimes it was really very difficult to comprehend what was being said and one needed to rewind the video multiple times and read the subtitles. Other than that, nothing to complain.Cheers!",0,1,Ashish Pandey,77435468

The only minor thing is that other peers are grading your final project (but this is just a small portion of a final grade). Some participants can submit their reports written not in the English language. Some supervision of the final project would be helpful.,0,0,Dmytro Ivasiuk,11614369

The second last course of this professional certificate Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning is a good courses which tries to introduces Neural-Net, CNN, LSTM, Reinforcement Learning and other deep learning concepts. As deeplearning is a vast subject and there are several specialization available in Coursera. This single course provides  a good introduction of the subject matter.I​ highly recommend this specialization for anyone who is aspiring to become a data-scientist / Machine learning expert.",0,0,Bishal Bhattarai,13258830
