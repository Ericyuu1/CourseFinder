17958459~COURSE!~XSLeWQ6pEeu9ZBLzQTJEhw,1631295587256,3,0,"T​his course covers quite a lot of the historical background of Hangeul, its creation and its creator. While that is interesting I found that some of the content was very repetitive, and the delivery also felt a bit slow to me (I had to watch on 1.75 speed to not lose interest). It would have been nice in my opinion to have less repetition and instead have more time in the videos spent on actually reading and writing Hangeul. How to write individual letters was easy to follow but diphthongs were glossed over briefly, and batchim pronunciation rules were not explained either, so when it came to writing common phrases at the end of the course, it wasn't always clear why a ""b"" sound is suddenly pronunced like an ""m"" sound, for example. All in all, I think the course is interesting for people who have 0 knowledge about Hangeul yet and want to know more about its history but it is not enough to get you to the point of reading Hangeul fluently.

I really liked the historical facts and the explanation of each letter and vowel of Hangeul. However, I noticed that in the Self-check sections, one could choose any of the options and get a score of 100. In my opinion, this can make the person assume that they understood the topic perfectly instead of leading them to read and watch the resources again to correct themselves.
