37653407~COURSE!~qvN49o9eEeebBBJ8AIlx3A,1647222422643,1,0,"This specialization should be called... `HOW DO I SEARCH FOR COMPONENTS FOR A DRONE ON THE INTERNET ´. You lose a lot of time searching for components for the drone, which could have been used for designing with Fusion 360. A waste of time in my opinion. If the assessment of the last assignment of each course takes at least one week, then this also means a significant financial loss for the student. Apparently the tutors from Autodesk don't take the evaluation of the course assignments very seriously, since about 80% of the submitted assignments by the fellow students are some crap. I could have saved myself a lot of time AND MONEY by also handing in csome rap to pass the course. Very frustrating...
Autodesk should revise the specialization and take assignment evaluation more seriously.",0,1,Jens Erdmann,37653407

That means for every lesson you learn how things used to be done and where tools used to be, then you teach yourself how to do it with the current version of the software.  Assignments and quizzes you then need to recall the process of the older version in order to pass.  While some things are still accurate it is unnecessarily time consuming to memorize instructions for an outdated program version then teach yourself how to complete exercises in the new version.
