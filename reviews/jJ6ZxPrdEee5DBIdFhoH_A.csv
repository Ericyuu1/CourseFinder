It feels more like an overview of the content creator's opinion or (scientific) standing about psychology instead of an introduction psych class which is supposed to be unbiased (less personal), full of scientifically proved theories (the annimation and poor presentation are not helping!) and psychologically interesting and helpful towards an online audience (instead of students trying to get an easy A). Learned all the way to week 5 and decided not to continue due to the poor scientific quality. I'd like an intro psych class NOT about understanding how certain researchers think (that's not introductory), BUT on what psychology is and how it can help! If I'm knowledgable enough of psych, then it might be good to attend an advanced psych course presented in a smililar style where I know how to extract the information to form my own understanding and research more into a subtopic I'm interested in, or intereact for clarification if I'm in an actual classroom.

If I only want to talk about a lump of meat and how it works as put in this course I can concentrate merely on physiology. The Greeks clearly made the difference between a healthy spirit in a healthy body. To just claim the brain is a lump of meat and is triggered organically is very ignorant and not scientific. Humans are not just bones, meat and blood. The spirit dwells in every organic fibre of our body. Body & spirit is one unity as long as the spirit dwells in it. When a human suffers from a trauma, no matter whether the attack has been on a psychic or physic level it always hurts both parts of a human. An attack with matter hurts the body and the soul. Whereas an attack on a spiritual level hurts the soul and can further influence organic damage. To just ignorantly state that this is not the case, is so very wrong.

It has incredibly outdated language around gender and sexuality - to the point of being offensive - and shockingly detrimental and outdated content with regards to mental health, trauma, and mental illness. Some examples: 
- In the video lecture on parenting, Bloom talks about the idea that children are to blame for their bad/abusive parents: ""So, for instance, children who are spanked tend to be more violent. Now, one possibility is there are genes that make parents likely to spank and children likely to be violent or genes that proposed people say to low impulse control lean both to the spanking of bad behavior. A second possibility maybe the one that most people believe is that parents spanking their kid makes her kid meaner. But a third possibility is if you have an aggressive and violent kid, you're more likely to spank him or her and that will be a child effect.""
- The comment, again, in the parenting lecture, ""Which is that parenting doesn't matter anywhere near as much as people believe it does."" This course doesn't have ANY discussion of attachment theory or trauma. Parenting matters HUGELY in terms of its effects on children with regards to so, so many things. It actually changes their brain structure, in the case of emotional neglect or abuse of any kind. I was shocked that none of this was addressed. It ignores a huge portion of psychological findings in the past few years, blames the victims (your parents are spanking you because you're bad/violent). I was absolutely appalled, as were my psychologist friends with whom I shared this information. 
- In the first lecture in week 5, entitled ""Mental Illness,"" I was once again SHOCKED to hear this statement, ""What you find in these pages is a lot of things, this includes some crazy people muttering on the streets as in schizophrenia."" In a lecture on mental illness, a psychologist labels someone with schizophrenia as ""crazy""? Unbelievable. First of all, there should be compassionate, people-first language. Secondly, to label someone with mental illness as ""crazy"" is offensive and inaccurate. I was totally shocked to hear that in this course. 
- Later on, and I have to find it, Bloom talked about ""alcoholics and drug addicts"" - again, I was shocked to see a complete refusal to use people-first language. I expected to hear ""someone with alcoholism or drug addiction."" 
This course, as I mentioned, desperately needs to be updated. It needs:
- something that addresses attachment theory & the impact of trauma
- people-first language
- a more nuanced, scientifically-updated understanding of gender and sexuality
This course is far, far behind the times. It's victim-blaming and heteronormative. ",0,2,Megan Gilbuena,99830648

I really wanted to give it five stars, but I couldn't do so considering the points where the course moved from psychology to indoctrination against faith perspectives. Different views should be presented, and the professor is certainly entitled to his, but his approach to the philosophical ""discussions"" and deliberate use of sacred text to negatively influence seemed designed to disparage and offend. The reference to the Book of Matthew, which I understand has been used for some time, is an egregious misuse (not even just a misinterpretation) of scripture. The use of Ecclesiastes was better, admittedly, but still degrades its sacred meaning to those who choose that faith. There are places for meaningful discussions of this kind, here it came off as opportunistic influence of eager, younger learners.",0,0,April MacDicken,1430340

I did have a number of issues with a few areas, like another commentator mentioned there’s a strangely aggressive attack on all forms of spiritualism due to the fact that we think with our brains (?) that’s never really justified in my opinion (declaring atheism true over agnosticism, which seems more scientific to me).And there is a point later on where a large segment of a lecture is dedicated to Judith Rich Harris’s extreme take on parenting methods, which is that they have 0 psychological impact on adults later in life (even if abusive) and that the only real factors in upbringing are genes and outer social environments. This has been highly contested since it was published in 1998, but we aren’t provided any in-depth legitimate alternate perspectives. It was confusing to see it’s inclusion as it seems to stick out as contradicting large portions of other lectures and raises a number of serious ethical questions that are glossed over.

Otherwise, the information was easy enough to understand, and what little couldn't be immediately ascertained was defined for me usually at the end of the reading portions. The reading portions were marked as 10 minutes each, which is just wildly inaccurate. They were 40 minutes at minimum for me, and I'm sure others with faster reading skills could get it done in half the time, but it is still certainly not ten minutes worth. They have captions on every video, I wasn't aware of that in the first 2 weeks of the course, but after that, I realized where the subtitles button was (the [...] in the bottom right corner).

I took intro psych in college years ago and thought this course would be a good review and would update my knowledge. I was surprised to find that very little was review; most of it was new to me! I realize the course is not current. Professor Bloom has apparently since retired, though it looks like someone is curating it because some of the readings mention very recent studies.Since it won't be updated by Professor Bloom, suggesting improvements seems pointless. I do wish it had been a full semester-long course, or at least followed by a second half with many topics getting more in-depth coverage. I would have liked more on intelligence, for example. Also, the information on autism was outdated, since Asperger's is no longer in the DSM. Now that's part of autism spectrum disorder. In one video, he shows a video of Harlow's experiment with wire and cloth monkey ""mothers,"" never names Harlow as the experimenter, and then refers by name to Harlow in a subsequent lecture. Had I not known this from my own college course, I would have found it confusing.In the final video, he says he's provided a list of further readings. I can't find the list anywhere. Presumably it was there when the course originally ran. Please restore it.Last thing: The discussion forums are pretty bleak. I realize this is because people aren't taking the course as a cohort, so you really can't get into a discussion. People just aren't there. The other problem is that it's littered with posts by people wanting to form study groups elsewhere, like on WhatsApp. It would be nice to have a separate forum just for these posts so the weekly forums only have questions and posts related to the course material.",0,0,Lisa Vend,97681111

In fact, if he was to live today, I would be signing up for his classes. It's hard to find a psychology class that teaches Sigmund Freud's theory. There are a lot of statements by the lecturer of this course that I am a bit disagreed with and there are things that I agreed with. I hope one day there will a platform available for students to interact with the lecturer to discuss the materials. I felt like the course is too short and I only learnt a little. The course is a bit biased on the materialism concept. The dualism concept hasn't been spoken much. It seems like this course is filtering the whole psychology field towards with materialism concept.

In my opinion, the most important aspects of an online class include exciting visuals, interesting lectures, and use of outside sources. This class exhibited all three!This course had plenty of interesting visuals that floated in and out of the screen that kept me entertained and interested. It also helped me to understand certain things that Dr. Bloom was explaining which is important for visual learners. 	The lectures were interesting and Professor Bloom used many different real life examples to aid in understanding. I really felt as though he was knowledgeable about his field of study as I took the course and I felt as though I was being taught in a way that I could trust.	One of my favorite parts of the class was when outside videos were played about real life experiments in psychology. I found this extremely interesting. Even the TED talk included somewhere in the middle of the course was excellent because it gave us a different person’s perspective. My only negative about the class would be that I wish more outside videos had been displayed because I feel that they showed us as students how the subjects we were studying could be applied to the real world.	In conclusion, I really enjoyed this course! I can honestly say that I was excited to sit down at my computer and watch the videos every day.

61674711~COURSE!~jJ6ZxPrdEee5DBIdFhoH_A,1610386076588,5,0,"  Introduction to Psychology is a journey through all of the major psychological concepts and principles. The knowledge gained from this course will allow students to critically evaluate psychological research and have a more in-depth understanding of human thought and behavior.  Psychology is the study of the mind and behavior, according to the American Psychological Association. It is the study of the mind, how it works, and how it affects behavior. ... Psychologists and psychiatrists work together to help people with mental health conditions, but they are not quite the same  Psychology majors  develop a broad understanding of human behavior as well as the skills  to understand and interpret research findings concerning human behavior.  The psychology curriculum includes courses in cognitive, developmental, behavioral and neural studies, learning, personality, social and clinical psychology.   So as you have learned, the four primary goals of psychology are to describe, explain, predict, and change behavior   Intro Psych will always be a hard  course because the material is complex and broad, but it may be even  more difficult for you because you may lack background and experience to  tie all this new material to, and because your academic skills may be  less-than-perfect.   The three branches are: 1) the basic science of psychology,  whose proper subject matter is “mental behavior” which translates into  the behavior of the animal as a whole and includes thinking and feeling  as well as acting; 2) human psychology, whose proper subject matter is human behavior at the individual level and   Psychology is the  study of the mind, its thought, feeling and behaviour. It is an  academic discipline which involves the scientific study of mental  faculties, functions and behaviours. ... Psychologists attempt to understand the role of mental functions in individual and social behavior.   So, yes, it is possible to learn anything. ... The core of it would be your own passion towards psychology - if you are determined to learn, no one and nothing will stop you from reading materials and educating yourself. You can go on any college website and get a list of books/textbooks for courses and read them yourself.   Psychology is very important  especially because it deals with the study of the mental processes and  behaviour at the same time. It is also applied in our daily lives and in  many things. ... Psychology is also used to better understand and help those with pervasive developmental disorders such as autism.   The five major perspectives in psychology  are biological, psychodynamic, behavioral, cognitive and humanistic.  Each perspective provides its own view on the roots of why you do what  you do.   The four main goals of psychology are to describe, explain, predict and control the behaviour and mental processes of others. Describe. Psychology aims to understand the behaviour of others and gather information about the way the brain works in order to better serve humanity.   Define Psychology in your own words. Psychology  is the study of the human brain and the scientific factors that follow  it such as the behaviors one has. ... It changed from the study of the  soul to the study of the mind and the brain.  The Different Types of Psychologists and How Do They Help You    Biopsychologist.    Clinical Psychologists.

But sometimes it can be hard to know how to interpret feedback, especially if the comments aren’t what you expected, or if you’re unsure what they mean.It’s important not to take feedback as personal criticism. Lecturers mark thousands of assignments, and their end goal is not to point out your mistakes, but to suggest ways to improve your writing. Keep an open mind – at the end of the day, your teachers want to see you getting the best marks you can.In fact, feedback is the ticket to academic success, so think of it as an opportunity, not an obstacle. Here are some tips for reviewing the feedback you receive and using this knowledge to improve your assignment writing. 1. Interpret the feedbackFirst, try to determine exactly what the marker is commenting on. Is it the expectations set out in the unit learning outcomes and assignment marking rubric?Or, maybe it’s the structure of your writing or the language you have used?Maybe you need to pay attention to your use of sources, including the way you have referenced them?If you are unclear about the feedback that you received, make sure you speak to your unit chair, lecturer or tutor to clarify – in class, on the unit discussion forum or via email.2. Analyse and apply what you have learntThen, identify specific areas that you need to address for your next assignment.How can I improve my sentence structure?Am I showing adequate evidence? Enough analysis?Am I making my paper easily digestible for my reader?Am I providing too much or too little information?Keep a log of the comments you receive for various assignments – are there common issues that you need to address in your writing? And don’t forget to note any positive comments made by your marker: it’s useful to know your own strengths and build upon them.3. Talk it out and ask questionsIt really helps to discuss your feedback with someone else – it could be a classmate or a friend. The Study Support team can also help you do this. We have Writing Mentors and Language and Learning Advisors who can help you to interpret and review your feedback. 4. Utilise resources to improve your skillsBetter planning for your next assignment will help provide a better result. There’s an Academic Skills guide for almost every aspect of your university assignments, from integrating sources to proofreading to note taking. And, one of the most important things to do when you begin your next assignment is to read the assignment brief carefully to understand what is being asked of you. As one lecturer says, ‘when marking, we ask ourselves: did the student fulfil the task, and how? If not, what was missing from their assignment?’ You should ask yourself the same questions when writing your assignment.",0,6,Dr.Mohammad Kabir Hussain,61674711

His way of lecturing isn't by just telling us information, but also by making us a part of a discussion, this discussion helps us to understand and explore the topic of that week.  There are extra readings, discussion forms and so many more recourses to learn more. Next, the videos used elements of visualization along side other elements to aid to the process of diving into the topics of the lectures. In addition Coursera has a few options that really made me see that online learning may be as beneficial or even a bit more in some fields. Some of those options: saving certain moments in the videos as notes, the transcript, etc. Lastly, the whole team behind this course must  be at least applauded since this is a unpaid course.

Now, I'm relishing the course, and definitely taking all the time I need to LEARN it. I'm constantly behind schedule, but that's because I want to make the best of it, and I have other obligations as well. The second module gave me great insight into language teaching; I already had some knowledge of Skinner, Piaget and Chomsky, but it was superficial. Do I need it to teach English? Maybe not everyone, but I do. I need to see the foundation of the building in order to feel safe manipulating the top floor. I'm in the third part now, and the information I got from your talk as well as the appended articles about attention (esp. inattentional blindness) is going straight into a PP presentation I'm making about why my students shouldn't be checking Instagram while we're doing grammar (with proper referencing, of course).

I have learnt so much and this course gives a fantastic overview of the subject of psychology. I took this course because I have always been interested in the way people think and curious about the motivations for their behaviours. But more importantly, i wanted to understand my kids more, and help them in their pursuits in life, if I could. Some of the biggest challenges are in the areas of understanding their motivations and capabilities, and one current challenge is in memory retention for their studies. This course gave me a good overview on that, from encoding and methods of encoding information and how failures of memory can occur. But the sum of all the other parts, in understanding their personalities and perceptions are also important, because their ability to learn and retain information and translate them to knowledge also depends on how they think and where and why they are having challenges. I am reviewing the materials again and again because each time I learn something more than my initial reading. Prof Bloom has managed to condense the breadth and scope of a very complex and wide subject into a highly informational course. I am very grateful for these materials, to have an expert summarize the critical areas of learning to be further explored, if desired. The world is made better by generous contributions as these, for those who wish to understand oneself and others a little more, there is no parallel as starting point.I also found the animations cute as helpful mnemonics, well done to the animator! And to the Prof who understood that some of us especially an auditory and visual learner like myself need these to help make the points more distinctive and interesting. Lastly the last chapter on The Good Life, Subjective Well-Being, so needed to tie everything together, for we are a species who can not only intelligently process the causes and effects of our condition, but to also by our actions and design enrich ourselves and others if we so wish.

61453083~COURSE!~jJ6ZxPrdEee5DBIdFhoH_A,1590716803454,5,0,"I started this course merely to see if Psychology is a field that interests me. Due to some circumstances, I never had the opportunity to study any part of psychology in high school so I wanted to see where my interest stands to pursue higher education in psychology or even neuroscience. I recommend this course to all the people who are in the same position that I was or who are interested in building a good foundation to their knowledge on psychology. I found this course to be so interesting that I completed it in 6 days rather than the average time of completion being 6 weeks. Maybe a smarter idea would've been to have gone through this course gradually as it's meant to be completed in 6 weeks but the fact is that I became so interested that participation in this course seemed not only educational but fun too. Until 6 days ago I was unsure of what I want to major in college but now I think I can say I know the field I want to study for the upcoming 4 years as I had so much fun studying it. This course was very helpful and efficiently educational. The methods that were used were engaging and always left you wanting to research even more on the topics discussed. While taking this course I found out that many questions in psychology are unanswered. There are a lot of theories left to be proven. The good thing is that upon completing the course I feel motivated to do my own research and find possible answers to those questions. Whether I do find accurate answers is not nearly as important as the point that I have an interest to research those theories. To sum it up this course left me feeling inspired to further my knowledge on psychology.",0,0,Jonila Shehu,61453083

The course wasn't too difficult to understand and Professor Bloom was always asking deeply thought questions which required his audience to think a lot more about their own behaviors.  Throughout this course I myself was able to come to my own hypotheses and theories as to why I and others act a certain way and I'm ready to ask even more questions after doing this course. I'm not an Ivy league student by any means, (I'm in high school.) but I really do think that this course is well fitted for most people. Professor Bloom provides much visual representation throughout his videos. (He's a cartoon.) and speaks at a rate that's not too fast or too slow. (Plus subtitles help.) He further provides articles that are very reliable and relevant to what he's teaching and quizzes that can be redone easily if the student answers a few questions wrong. (or a lot.) I think it would be really interesting if Professor Bloom added courses that a person could do after Intro. to Psychology that were more focused on the specific subcategories of psychology, rather than psychology as a whole itself. For example, a whole class on developmental psychology, personality psychology, criminal psychology, and much more. Overall, I would recommend this course to anyone who just wants to understand people a little bit better. I give this course a 5/5.",0,0,Elise McKenna Acuff,52337466
