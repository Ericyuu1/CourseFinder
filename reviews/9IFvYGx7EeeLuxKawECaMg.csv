The quiz items were all in the videos but we just have to be more keen with the information. I was not able to score higher during the first week because I was not able to see that we can take the quiz three times every eight hours but it's all right. I was not able to get the required readings through some links provided in this course but I was able to get the materials through scanning the discussions and I found that someone posted a ink to the materials needed and I'm very thankful of that. I hope this course would be easily available in many hospitals and institutions, especially here in the Philippines. Patient safety here in the Philippines is poor (I experienced it firsthand) and I hope many would be able to commit to improve patient safety everywhere. I was able to attend this course through a scholarship grant and I'm very thankful of it. This course resonated to what I have in mind back when I was in the hospital (we're currently doing online work due to COVID pandemic and we, postgraduate interns, are going back to the hospital this January 2021) and I hope I could really share this relevant information to the hospital I'm in.
