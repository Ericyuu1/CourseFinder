92681031~COURSE!~-nRRAPmuEeSndSIAC7LTLQ,1633366423299,1,0,"T​his course is almost useless on the Coursera platform.  Fully 90% of the time, videos only play ""black screen"" i.e. you can hear voice but no video.  The rest of the time, the videos play, but with no audio!!! It is beyond frustrating when you have limited time to study and the website contunues to fail.T​his has nothing to do with my connection... I have superfast broadband here. It also has nothing to do with my ability to use a Macbook.  I have been an audio industry professional, using Logic (and Emagic, as  logic used to be called) for 23 years.I​ keep seeing that projects are ""overdue"" which is extremely unhelpful when the problems are entirely due to website failures.  I would be happy to pay for this course and access wider course material as I think the teaching is first class (when the platform is working), however, it would clearly be a frustrating waste of money while the Coursera platform is patently not working properly.P​lease advise if there is a different way to access this course material that is properly robust.  In addition, this course is for Live 10 and I am a new user, so I have only got access to Live 11.  Please advise if a Live 11 course is upcoming with Berklee and Erin Barra, because there are evidently significant differences that are not addressed in this course.T​hank you.",0,1,Jenna Bradley,92681031

Week 1 and 2 do scratch the surface of some Ableton topics, too fast and forgetting all the necessary details. All instructions were just done random clicking, nothing musical. Often she did not even let us hear what she did. Nothing is properly explained.The quizzes were too easy and the peer review assignments were all three weeks the same.Week 3 is totally useless and suddenly only explains advanced stuff not available in Ableton Intro, or explains how to google.Finally, this course requires (only for the assignments) to install Blend, create a user account there, and submit all your assignments to the Blend open online collaboration platform. Available for the whole world. This is totally irrelevant for this course and many students have technical problems with this. This can for example be seen the forum (BTW: the discussion forum questions are unanswered by Technical Assistents - normally, for Berklee courses, also that is much better)  So, in my opinion, this course should be redone completely.",0,1,Barend,15701414

I learned a lot in this short class and would love to see an ""intermediate"" Ableton class in the future.  My only complaints are related to the collaboration software that you need to use for this course, blend.io.  Site navigation in blend.io can be painfully slow, and the site is buggy.   I would have preferred to simply share information via dropbox or some other file sharing method.  The peer review process is a great idea, although I think it's really tricky to do this in a music/art, because there is so much subjectivity and not much of a rubric.  (There are some quantitative questions just to verify that the student follows instructions, but the open feedback is totally open).
