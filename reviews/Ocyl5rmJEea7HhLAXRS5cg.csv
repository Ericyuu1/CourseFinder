90159~COURSE!~Ocyl5rmJEea7HhLAXRS5cg,1603891554626,1,0,This is one of the worse courses I've taken on Coursera. It seems almost abandoned. The additional material linked are simply wikipedia pages and the video lectures simply talk through the subjects with very little explanation or examples. You end up scrubbing through the videos to find the two seconds that you need to answer quiz questions. I found myself using external resources so much to answer questions that I had that it made this course almost useless. Many of the quiz questions are unnecessarily tedious. I need to understand the algorithm not prove that I can do arithmetic that will always be a fraction of the speed of a computer. ,0,3,Zachary Whitley,90159

Although I'm mathematician, I've learnt new important facts in this course (especially those that refer to history or computation, including algorithms like trial division, Miller Rabin and RSA).However, a couple mistakes were found in the correct answers of the graded assessments.  In my opinion, the slides are nice, but not enough. There should be a formal document to explain in more detail and more rigorously each step of the mathematical procedures, since several of them cannot be explained in a video or in a slide.Also, the assessment should include more mathematical and programming exercises to put in practice the things we've learnt through the course.To conclude, very nice and indispensable content, but not as excellent and well prepared as in the first course lessons.",0,6,Eduard Gonzalvo Gelabert,33726802

86647~COURSE!~Ocyl5rmJEea7HhLAXRS5cg,1511798132969,4,0,"I love the way that this course presents the basic group theory and number theory concepts central to so much cryptography. For example, I've tried to teach myself about the the Chinese Remainder Theorem and its use through my own self-study, but never really grokked it until this course. The same is true of primality testing.The lectures really are outstanding, and the practice and graded assessments are extremely well constructed to help one get a real sense of what the theorems and algorithms do. The numbers in many of the problems are chosen to make certain things clear if you do those problems ""by hand"".My only criticisms are not about substance, and are things that may not apply to your sessions or have been addressed by the time you are reading this. There were some errors in the early problem sets, the course slides are distributed at powerpoint only (and not PDF), and during my session there was virtually no interaction with staff or fellow students on the forums. These are minor issues, probably specific to the session I was in, but in combination are why I'm rating this four stars instead of five.It is hard for me to assess how accessible this course is for most of the people who might take it. I found it ""easy"", but I've been doing self-study of this sort of stuff for a while. I also think that this is a ""what you get out of it depends on what you put into it"" sort of things. I got a lot out of it, but that is because I did the exercises both by hand, and then also wrote code to solve those same sorts of problems with bigger numbers.",0,4,Jeffrey Goldberg,86647
