The description should not be merely mathematical and formalistic, but should be accompanied by a ""didactic"" explanation from the teaching staff to the students.
Here what I have observed is that the teacher gives the lesson as a preacher reads the epistle, without any faith or feeling. Read the lesson, period. I think that although the training of teachers is exhaustive, the didactics, the transmission to the neophyte, is nil. And the mission of a teacher is to transmit, not read. If so, the technical notes are enough and your presence is not necessary.
Because of this I unsubscribe. Sorry I can't keep up.

I can say that I have a masters degree in nuclear astrophysics and a PhD in nuclear physics. Not to be unkind, but I absorbed very little new information from this course, and I know very little about particle physics. I think a major problem is the language barrier, even though the target audience is English-speaking, the accents were so thick and pronunciations so bad, that I had to turn on subtitles just to understand what was being said. This is especially true of the two female instructors. If there were ancillary materials, I somehow missed them, but the videos were less than adequate for passing the tests. I often resorted to trial and error to pass the individual tests. Thus, the course became more of a test for my test-taking strategies than mastering any new understanding of physics. Perhaps, it might not be popular with your target, but improvements might be made with at least some required reading and a few homework problems in each module.
