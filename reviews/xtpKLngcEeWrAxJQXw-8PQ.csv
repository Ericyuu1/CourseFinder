The writing assignments are fun and sometimes challenging. The interviews with the visiting writers are interesting and the instructors for each course are well qualified. BUT - there are some major defects with the learning platform used by Coursera.The most frustrating aspect of the learning platform is the peer feedback system. To be a good writer, one needs to hear critical feedback from readers that will help the writer hone their skills. In each of the four courses, the ""feedback"" was beyond weak, nearly non-existent. Most of the ""peers"" who reviewed my assignments would leave one word as their entire feedback. Or one dash sign, or one period or one comma. How is this helpful? It isn't and Coursera needs to address this major flaw in their platform.In addition, some of the writing submissions that I received to read and provide feedback on were sometimes 5 years old. I understand that there may not be enough submitted assignments at any given time, but I would prefer to wait and receive fresh assignments so that my feedback might actually help the writer improve their skills. I'm sure that my feedback on a 5 year old assignment will never be viewed by the writer.Unless and until Coursera addresses this annoying and frustrating weaknesses in their learning platform, these courses are practically useless and I cannot in good faith recommend them to anyone.

For the most part the course material presented was good, especially the courses on plot, on setting, and on style.  The course on characterization was a little vague.  From the syllabus, it looked like it would be a good course, but the instructor did not follow the syllabus and was often very unfocussed in her presentation.The weakness with this specialization is that all the feedback to the writer is provided by peers in the course.  This I found very disappointing.  Many of the other students were honestly very poor writers, and as a result, the feedback I received on my assignments was very superficial.  In addition, rather than being able to learn from reading the writing of others, I found for the most part that the pieces submitted by others were very lacking.If you take this course, know that it will provide you some good information about writing fiction, but the feedback you receive on your assignments will not help you learn.

The instructor is incredibly erudite and poetic, which made this module more challenging for me (beginner). I felt that this module requires a mastering of basic knowledge that I didn't have, as a beginner, and despite having gone through all the previous courses. Perhaps this is why it's the fourth course in the specialization (though one can take them in whichever order one likes) - the degree of difficulty of the subjject goes up as one moves on. The assignments were also the most challenging, but that, to me, made them more interesting; one needs to push oneself more, go back and review what was taught in the other courses in the specialization.  (-) The peer reviews remain the major minus of this and other creative writing MOOC courses. The tips on how to improve one's writing, provided by mentors, are excellent but rare, in my experience.  The reviews by by beginners like myself - doing the best one can, offering constructive detail advice within our limited know-how and experience - are helpful but a small a minority. Many are  too brief, or consisting of monosyllabic answers (""good"", ""great"", ""ok"", etc.) I suppose it's part of the creative arts MOOC experience, all the people that with moderate to little interest in the subject that just want to fast forward their way to a relatively inexpensive certificate - no expense tuition and living costs, no stringent admission requirements - by a good university...ALL IN ALL a good experience like the rest of the courses in the specialization.

I have ended up following the thread started in the videos and researching more from those rather modest starting points . The better a video lesson is the more I am left feeling it could have been even more, given a little more, a longer, less compacted teaching/learning curve.

Having anyone read our work is great and hard to come by, but having a professional, at least from time to time - now that is what learning is really about. Way back when I was still a student in London I remember noticing the beginnings of this trend in the university I was at: ""peer feedback"" and ""peer learning"" became all the rage, the new buzz words. And yes they are very important elements of the learners experience, but they should complement, rather than substitute the process. It is so very convenient to have learners teaching one another, both in an online as well as presential course, not the least because it decreases the time and money spent on a qualified teachers. The fact that this details is overlooked in the course description shows that it is a sensitive topic and that it might put a number of potential learners off. The course has value and brings satisfaction as well as surprising (self) revelations. Therefore it can afford to be more transparent.To cut this short, why not re-introduce the qualified staff and make this an even more valuable experience?

I thought it would be the most extraneous of the series. I thought the plot and character class would be more important but in fact, just paying attention to style helped the movement of my stories - it forced things to happen, it forced a plot, it forced a character to do things. Scribona's advice is practical - use more nouns and verbs, pay attention to how you describe the world through the eyes of the characters, learn how to edit and so on. He helped me finally get a handle the POV i use all the time in writing, but never really understood, and so I used it badly.  Some of the other classes in the specialization were too heady, and not practical.  But most importantly, Scribona's love for the written word was so apparent during the lectures that it elicited the same reverence in the students. ",0,0,salima hamirani,15192336
