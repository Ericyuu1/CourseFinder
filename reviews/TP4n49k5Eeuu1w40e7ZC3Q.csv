88005451~COURSE!~TP4n49k5Eeuu1w40e7ZC3Q,1657644387346,5,0,"(Note I am posting this review after each course since I am unable to post an overall review for the specialization)Hi,I recently completed this course as part of the 3 week specialization ""Image Processing for Science and Engineering"".  I think the Mathworks team really did a great job of walking a student step by step from initial concepts into direct applications.  I think many courses I have taken (for example for AI Computer Vision) can be overly theory heavy and can miss making the proper connection into doing something useful.  Here, with all of the courses, they made a great overview of the software technology and apps that are available in MATLAB and gave great examples for how to quickly utilize them.  MATLAB had many tools available that do a lot of the heavy lifting and function generation for you, so you can start attacking problems right away.  I also thought the challenge level was appropriate.  Some of the final projects are involved, but if you are doing the training properly you won't have much issue.  The course developers were very responsive in offering advice if I got stuck.  If you are doing anything that requires you to process/alter large blocks of photos (or videos) I strongly recommend you check these courses out.",0,1,Christopher Bellezza,88005451

 You should be familiar with MATLAB before taking this course.         ",0,1,Aatif Ahmad,47309932
49980842~COURSE!~TP4n49k5Eeuu1w40e7ZC3Q,1644666407632,5,0,"What I like about this course the most is their short videos that covers the basics you need to know. They try not to throw too many information at you. Then the provided practice examples help you deepen your understanding. I like that approach and I find it very practical. However, I felt some of the quizzes questions were not very well written. I have been using Matlab for almost 15 years and have been using it for image processing for more than 10 years, yet some of these questions were confusing to me.",0,1,ESLAM TAHA,49980842
