It has no vidoes, just a few pages telling you to copy and paste code and just at the end of week 1, it's telling you to actually work it out it yourself which is mimpossible as you haven't actually learned much of anything yet.

2023951~COURSE!~vyHp91woEeugOA4J84JY3Q,1677203100707,5,0,"Great intro to Python! At first I was disappointed by the lack of video lectures one expects from Coursera. However, this material is so logically presented, that my general take away (as someone who has taken other coding classes), is that the producers of this course are not simply programmers or computer scientists but pedagogists of a caliber higher than a simple subject matter expert that other courses may feature. First, the material is appropriate for beginners. Second, the challenges are appropriate to the level, and build in complexity with each subsequent section -no more and no less. And most importantly - no awkward giant leaps in knowledge gain are required from one section to the next, that one might experience in other classes covering this subject matter.Highly recommend!",0,0,Terry O'Gara,2023951
