59146032~COURSE!~wpn4egf-EeuLJgpoLwc6uQ,1610746531641,3,0,"Gives a history of globalization in the Arctic, and presents some indigenous views regarding it. Unfortunately, there is not a lot about indigenous cultural values and despite the fact it talks about the importance of listening to and respecting the values of others it does not usually show both sides of the argument on e.g. the reasons some conservationists campaigned against polar bear hunts for tourists, or commercial fur production and whaling. Some facts are also wrong, for example the presenter claims that polar bear populations are not in decline.",0,1,Emma Brown,59146032

108994905~COURSE!~wpn4egf-EeuLJgpoLwc6uQ,1657280818269,4,0,"A few quiz questions had the wrong answer as ""correct"" (ex, in quiz 2 there was two - I live in the Arctic, and knew the answers so I went back and checked in the material when I got them incorrect, and the material showed I had selected the correct answer). Perhaps a technical glitch? Was able to re-do the quiz without penalty so it wasn't a big deal, just annoying. Overall, I learned a lot during this course!! Transcripts were challenging to read for videos (if that is what you like to do), but the material was good.",0,0,Erin Everard,108994905
40894917~COURSE!~wpn4egf-EeuLJgpoLwc6uQ,1623166127431,4,0,"I​ found this course very interesting and increased my knowledge of the Arctic and its economies. I have taken the Indigenous Canada course previously and have the same citicism of both. When the subject matter touches upon education, please note that many univiersties in Canada hold open places for Indigenous students across Canada. I learned this while living in Yellowknife. Also, there are many incentives for the students from northern Canada who attend  university in the ""south"" to return home. I think we would all do well to remember that the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches are more responsible for residential schools than politicians. This was a wonderful course for capturing the world's north and I thoroghly enjoyed it. Keep these coming!",0,0,Elisabeth Reib,40894917

As at least one other reviewer mentioned some of the quizzes had iffy answers---and question one of the final noncredit quiz was genuinely annoying---but at least these quizzes didn't have the typos found in the other MOOCs.A​lso the speakers were very good but I don't believe were ever identified---as with other U of Alberta MOOCS the advertised speakers were not the ones actually presenting the lectures.S​o 4.5 stars rounded up to 5.,0,0,michael parmenter,69915545
