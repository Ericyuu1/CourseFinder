24288539~COURSE!~Qjj3KjrWEeWO-Qq6rEZAow,1499275518040,3,0,"Good information, you learn a lot about Veteran care and makes you aware of the unique issues faced by veterans as well as tools to help you better care for your veteran patients. Unfortunately however unable to get the certificate of completion in a reasonable time. I turned all my assignments on time but they never got graded on time even if you turn your assignments on time. Even when you enroll on a different session in an effort to get your certificate, and you grade multiple students Still dont get your assignments graded. Its like a vicious circle, hoping that some point you get lucky enough to be worthy of being graded. It is frustrating to spend the time and money to go through the course and complete the assignments, yet unable to obtain the certificate. My second time around and it seems to be in the same predicament as when I took it for the first time. ",0,0,Angelica M Smith,24288539
