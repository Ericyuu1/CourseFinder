mental exercise that would get me out of my comfort zone. Thank you for the
opportunity you gave me to learn a little more about solar energy,even though I
do not live in New York,I learned to have the roadmap of how an expert should
learn to deal with various aspects,from compliance with fire codes, generation
calculation, the electrical system involved and its design,Learned about
instruments used for installation. I was surprised at times by realizing the
greatness of knowledge that is inserted not only in the area of mechanical
engineering,electric,civil and various
correlated professions. Thank you.And congratulations for the didactics, it is remarkable the
love that the instructor of this specialization has with what she does.
Congratulations.",0,3,Davi Furuse de Barros,51749477
