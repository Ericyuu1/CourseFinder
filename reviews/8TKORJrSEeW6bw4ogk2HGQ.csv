Also the readings were important and added value to the learning experience.On the other hand there are - in my opinion some aspects that made this course a not so rich experience. First, there are some audio issues in the videos. Second, the quizzes are excessively easy and the in video quizzes should not appear in the weekly assignments. If there are required readings, some of the quiz questions should relate to those readings. This way students had an incentive to go over those readings. But the most salient thing that made my experience very limited was the fact that one of the instructors - the one that presented most of the videos, was excessively nervous and all that he did was read the slides, in most cases not doing so naturally and committing errors, rephrasing, stopping, changing speed. I found it very, very difficult to follow along what he was saying. I had to focus only on the slides, otherwise I would get distracted. I think it is ok to be nervous or at ease, but the team should alerted him to this, and shoot the videos again and again until they had acceptable and balanced quality. A minor thing, I would like to had available the weekly slides to further reflection. I think the video issues that I've mentioned should been carefully planned before this course made it mainstream.This is my opinion.

This covers civilians, criminals, and of course associated government activities. There is a strong component on the motivation of cyber attackers. This is crucial for any cyber analyst, since there is the potential to dissuade or even eliminate the motivation for the cyber hacker to carry out attacks. Another really interesting aspect of the cyber space arena is the comparison of it to the traditional war space. Is it the same? This gets to the heart of the nature of cyber space, it's intangibility, and its no-boundaries, classless nature. The final analogy drawn is between the cyber tools/war race and the nuclear arms race. Readings support the fact that we are in the early stages of cyber space, but are they really the same? I enjoyed this course, and it's different approach to more technical cyber courses. My only comment would be that the quiz content would be more broad, and not relate directly back to smaller quizzes in each lecture. In other words, to allow for more thinking on the topic relating to the readings, and understanding of the materials, since this is not a cut and dry cyber course, it is quite subjective.
