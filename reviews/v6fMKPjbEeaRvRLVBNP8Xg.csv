I have done already more than ten different courses on Coursera, but this one is the worst.First of all, here are not enough students and the grading and peer grading is taking lot of time, so you have to wait for certificates. Second, Unity tutorials are old and very bad. There are project submissions, but nobody will tell you how to upload and what to upload. My project file has 2GB and I have no chance to upload it to My submission. In other courses are exact instructions how to upload in new Tools we have to learn. Here is nothing and also the tone of the teaching persons is very bad one. I regret that I started this course and I am not sure if I will finish it. ",0,1,Alexandra Streckova,93276737

30797576~COURSE!~v6fMKPjbEeaRvRLVBNP8Xg,1528670664866,1,0,"The tutorials leave a lot to be desired, and I have some expertise on this because I'm a college instructor and have been producing video tutorials for years. Most of the videos are more like demonstrations, as opposed to instruction. The first couple of courses in this specialization are fine, because it doesn't get deeply into the meat of using Unity. If you already know how to use Unity3D, then you'll probably be able to complete the 5 classes without a problem. If you didn't know how to use Unity (or Unreal, etc.) when you started these classes, then I wouldn't recommend that you take the 5 course series. It just gets worse. The material gets more complex but the videos don't instruct. They provide a sort of general overview of what to do. Even when you are provided with some materials (such as scripts or Unity packages) they don't always work.Once you get past class 2, you better have A LOT of extra time in your life because you'll probably be spending many hours hunting down additional help online, watching loads of extra videos and doing a bunch of trial and error hours just to get to the point where you have a project you can upload to the course assignment page.

34453037~COURSE!~v6fMKPjbEeaRvRLVBNP8Xg,1599402399448,3,0,"I loved the first course of this specialization (""Introduction to Virtual Reality""), but I found this one to be a little underwhelming.To be fair though, I half expected this disappointment, simply because most of the course is dedicated to teaching Unity. If you are a complete beginner, I think this is not a good way to learn Unity. Learning how to use Unity is not about knowing how place a 3D object and scale it, it is about feeling confident enough when using the engine, that learning new ways of using it does not feel like a huge effort. This is better achieved through dedicated tutorials, with ""code along"" projects etc... If you do not know anything about Unity, you should be prepared to spend a lot more time than indicated here.If you know Unity however, I think it is cool to have to spend some time designing a VR environment for the assignments, I really enjoyed doing it!Regarding the theory, I loved the section about audio for VR, which was very synthetic, and really emphasized what audio can bring to the experience, and how to use it at its best. The graphics part was also good, especially if you don't know anything about computer graphics in general, but I feel that the specificities of VR for graphics could have been better discussed. Here I only have anecdotal differences (for instance, bump maps does not work well in VR.).At the end of the first course (""Introduction to Virtual Reality""), I had the feeling that I had learned how to describe a VR project with precise technical terms. Unfortunately, with this course, I do not feel as if I had learned a solid framework to set up and describe my environment modeling project (for instance: how do you scale objects to make sure it feels good? What reference scale should we use?).Last point, I have the feeling that the teaching staff has deserted the forums. Last message I could find from a teacher or teaching assistant was dated back 2 or 3 years ago. Now forums are flooded with students asking for positive reviews for their assignments, which I think is a pity. ",0,4,Ian Cherabier,34453037
