However, these assignments also task the student with writing code which is impossible to write in 10 minutes. Throughout the specialization, I often took between 1-7 hours to complete a reading/coding assignment.

4246900~COURSE!~Eeb34jesEeWXuQopUhAqaw,1617642331255,5,0,"My review is for Java Programming and Software
Engineering Fundamentals Specialization in general:It's great for beginners, especially if
you're somewhat intimidated by the complexity of programming as a
concept (as I was) and have zero or close to zero experience. You'll learn
basic concepts and Java syntaxis and you'll apply it a lot in your
assignments. The instructors are great and watching lectures was not only
useful, but entertaining as well. Note that course materials date back to 2015, Java have evolved since then, but basics stay the same. My personal result of taking the
Specialization was gaining some confidence in being able to write
(eventually) working code out of my head. And I consider it an
accomplishment, so here goes 5 out of 5. These were pros, cons are below.Don't get those % of people who
""changed their career"" after this
specialization mislead you. It is not enough to change ones career,
at least where I live. Enough to apply for unpaid internship -
maybe, but nothing more. And there are three problems
with this specialization which will affect you. First, if you have no prior programming
knowledge and nobody around to help you, you'll probably struggle a lot to get
through it. But the 4th course discussion forums are basically dead, mentors
won't answer your questions exactly like they haven't answered same questions
several years ago. Same with the Capstone (one of the most important tasks
in it is phrased so misleading that I spent a DAY trying to understand what I'm
supposed to do and trying various options to only fail the quiz again and
again. And the same question is all over the forum, dating months or 2 years
back, unanswered, the assignments statement not rephrased for better
understanding. But if you look long enough, you'll find the hint, given by the
student, not mentors). So by the end you'll be on your own.Second, BlueJ (the IDE provided for
practice) won't do you any good, because nobody uses it in real world. I
strongly suggest that you start using proper IDE (like IntelliJ
IDEA or Eclipse at least) as early as you can. It's a lot better for debugging
and you'll also be able to mention it in your future CV.Third problem is ""estimated
time"" for your programming assignments. If it says 10 minutes - it means
it takes 10 minutes to read it, not to complete. Personally, I struggled to
keep up with weekly deadlines, and the courses took almost most of my time
off work.To conclude - it's a great
opportunity for non-programmers to discover programming, but a lot of time
and effort will be required to get the certificate, if you want one. Hopefully my review will help you to make an informed decision. ",0,11,Ekaterina Voronova,4246900

The instructors not only teaches coding syntax but also walk the learner through the problem solving process which is specially beneficial to novices.   Though the projects and question statements of the first four courses were precise and easy to understand, in the last course the one with the project I really had to struggle to understand what is actually being required of in some part of the project.

They ask you to do a lot of coding, which is great since that's the only way to really gain proficiency. And the code they ask you to write is, in my opinion, pretty hard for someone new to coding.

However I really hope if there can be more content. The course is rather short. The quality is good but the quantity is a bit insufficient.I hope this course can be longer. Additional weeks can teach us how to convert BlueJ projects or Eclipse projects into EXE  or host it in the cloud.I also hope this course, in the future, teaches us to make graphical user interface, which would be a nice conclusion to whatever program that we makeI love the course. I really want to see more coming out of the Capstone project. I love the idea of the capstone building a recommender engine. However, to make it a complete package, I suggest a few things:---Teach learners to use main() to create apps and convert to exe---Teach learners, after the entire project codings, how to create an Applet out of the source codes---Teach learners how to implement graphical user interface (make buttons, input field for movie queries)---Teach learners how to, instead of getting data from a file in the folder, reads the data from a live-feed instead. That would enhance the learning experience of the course.Thank you for all those. I'm a hungry guy so I suggest lots of things. However I'm very happy with the course designs. Very engaging and fruitful course series.",0,2,Huynh Long Do,15854114
