40319565~COURSE!~S3Hq7-PtEeaH9Q51wS-wDA,1660718742753,1,0,"C​ompared to the first two courses in the Software Development Lifecycle specialization, Engineering Practices for Building Quality Software is of lower quality. The course covers a wide range of topics, without explaining any of them in detail. After completing this course, I feel like I learned only some random, tiny bits of information.I​ completed this only because I was already on my way to getting the full Software DEvelopment Lifecycle specialization, but in retrospective I would stop at the first two courses and avoid this one",0,0,Davide Toniolo,40319565

Most peer review evaluation having rating as 0 or 1/15/ other value, which make very challenging to evaluate and give rating. Candidates has written something however not enough inline with rubic, so what could be rating? Definitely not 0 as there is information and with this option left is next higher rating which is full value. And full value would not be right again as there is some information missing as per rubic. ",0,1,Rajendra Aswale,44211995
50198407~COURSE!~S3Hq7-PtEeaH9Q51wS-wDA,1589900947656,2,0,"I was really looking forward to this particular course, but found the technical issues with many of the lessons to be distracting.  There were sound problems on a couple of the videos and I found some of the course materials hard to follow.  I reported the issues as I found them, so hopefully they will be fixed in the future.  There were also some style issues with the materials.  For example, in all or nearly all of the videos the Instructor took up half of the screen (I don''t mind looking at the instructor, but in many cases the materials were hard to read on my screen because they were not the focus of the lesson).  The slides were almost all text, and often what was said and what was showing on the screen did not match.  Finally, I am a visual learner.  Diagrams, pictures, visual comparisons, charts and graphs can go a long way in helping me to comprehend the materials.  Reading text on the screen does not help me to learn the materials.  Using the one quiz per hour approach (rather than 3 tests every 4 hours) combined with questions which did not always map to the course materials created several lost hours of study.  Some of the source materials were world class, but many of the referenced links were to bloggers and opinions and often the references were several years old and did not reflect current state of the art. Finally, I had to repeatedly report one individual for cheating and it took almost a week to get the issue resolved.  I don't know if it was the support staff who resolved it, or a note I sent the individual when grading his blank submission.  I knew he was cheating when I saw that after I graded the blank submission, he submitted an exact copy of my work for three different exercises.  ",0,8,Michael Fairless,50198407
