It was pretty much left to the students of the course to support one another, and since students begin and finish course and all different times I found it difficult at times to get any responses in the discussion boards. Tip: Finish the final assignment several days early to give plenty of time for peer review. Mine was submitted about 9 days early with no peer review until about a day before the due date. Some on the discussion boards had no peer reviews even after the due dates. Again, the information and videos were great, but I would have liked to have at least a little interaction from instructors (or at least assistants) in the discussion boards.

It took 2 years, ""better"" times in general meaning did not happen - but a full scale war of russia in Ukraine did, so studying social psychology become much more obviously actual and today I finally would like to share that really great course - ""Unethical decision making in organizations"" - with everybody who is looking for answers what the hell is going on, how come bad things could be done by good people (bad ones are not so interesting), how to protect yourself, your organization and thus society from that.

You will find there the easiest explanations of such concepts like ethical dilemma, framing effect, ethical blindness, strong situation, will review a set of heuristics in people’s adaptive toolbox, will see how strong context, language and different types of pressure influenced decision-making at famous failures at giant organizations (Ford, Enron, NASA and others) and more. 

Additional materials to course's topics should be noted too, the most important for me was an essay ""Power of Powerless"", written by Checkoslovakian dissident V. Gavel in 1978 about the post-totalitarian regime of Soviet Union - how it influenced people's behavior, how weak it was and why it looked vise-versa - strongly recommend to all people suffering from totalitarian institutions (or its parody). Though the documentary ​​“Four Horsemen” with critic of capitalism will be not less interesting too.
