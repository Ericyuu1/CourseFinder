Pros: The videos are clear and concise, with high ""signal-to-noise ratio"". Tests during the videos were on point and exposed common misconceptions people commonly have when learning Kotlin. The solution videos after completing the weekly projects were helpful in making working code more efficient and readable.

Cons: The instructions for Week 3 incorrectly specified what was required, leading me on a wild goose chase for several hours. There were only solution videos for weeks 1 to 3.

It gives a pretty good view into the more useful parts of the language and definitely makes a great case for a Java developer to become a Kotlin convert. My only complaints about this course are in regard to the GameOfFifteen assignment. The README on what they are looking for points to a web version of the game and basically says to implement an isEven function to check if a permutation is solvable and then implement the game interface to get everything working. The problem is this: I implemented my game just the way the web game works - specifically, my game chose a random cell to be the empty cell upon initialization, just as the web game did. I also set up my ""hasWon"" state to be the case where the numbers are in order AND the empty cell is in the bottom-right position, just as the web game seemed to be showing. When I ran the tests on my project, they failed. I had to do a debug deep dive to find that the tests are expecting that hasWon can be true regardless of the position of the empty cell, as long as the numbers are in order and to find that the tests expect the game to always initialize with the empty cell in the bottom-right position. It was easy enough to fix my game to match their tests rather than the example game, but I lost some time unnecessarily to this. It would probably be helpful to others who take this course if a couple simple notes in the README were added to indicate that the game should initialize with the empty cell in the bottom-right position and that the game is won if the cells are in ascending numerical order regardless of the position of the empty cell.",0,0,Michael Smith,81647698

The best things: The Scope/Auxiliary Functions.  Live them, Learn them, Love them - pay attention to Week05. I actually became a better Java programmer while trying to get my feet unstuck from all the Kotlin mud you have to walk through to understand those functions. Extension functions are also nice, although not used as much as I would have imagined. The main presenter is amazing, she always seems to be one step ahead of a question you may have.The worst things: You will hear the word ""concise"" a lot, do not be fooled. Kotlin is anything but concise. (1) It seems to be designed to become an endless buffet-table of every possible desire and wish for any API call you ever wanted. Good luck maintaining ""concise"" Kotlin code.   (2) Kotlin is not ""precise"". This course seems to argue that removing type-declarations, return types, argument types, etc is good programming practice and called ""concise"". How is it ""concise"" to come back a week later and have to rely on mousing over statements in the IDE to see what hints the IDE provides? That is not programming, that is an IDE telling you what you should have done, what you should do, or will eventually do. As someone new to Kotlin I do not like Kotlin as a language, but this class is really amazing, well produced, and totally complete, prepare for a lot of work.",0,0,Gavin Pyde,50380227

me a little that Svetlana was speaking freely (i.e. not reading a
script), because she often interrupts mid-sentence and starts over.
But in the end I'm thankful that she did it that way, because it's a
refreshing difference to the often sterile presentations found with
other courses. You can almost ""hear"" her thinking. There's
this one moment somewhere in week 5, where you can hear her
frustration over not being able to transform her thought into speech
at first try. It feels authentic.For me, the time
estimates given for the assignments in Week 4 and especially 5 was
