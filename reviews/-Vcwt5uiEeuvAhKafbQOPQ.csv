1427998~COURSE!~-Vcwt5uiEeuvAhKafbQOPQ,1647811697414,4,0,"Similarly to my review of previous course in the specialization, course and the lecturer is great, there could be more video materias. I still don't feel the connection between the research part and AI part. I know it's important and it gives some understanding of design thinking process and use of creativity to solve real-world problems for someone who don't know that. For myself, as a designer there is nothing new or valueable in that part. It could be better if the lecturer gives a particular topic that could be solved/designed through AI. Apart from that, there are book suggestions to read and I think I should read them to fully understand meaning of some concepts that aren't covered during the course.",0,3,Ernest Warzocha,1427998
