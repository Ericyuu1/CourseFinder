Misleading information in readings and quizzes, dry reading of the code in the videos (yeah, I really like to hear 127.0.0.1 ten times in two minutes, of course), final project without boilerplate code (well, there is a boilerplate, but in video format and you should type it out yourself), and, of course, it's really important to include in final exam a question how much buttons are at the VS Code debug toolbar.There is nothing in this course which you can't read in five minutes articles.",0,0,Mykola Babych,9618069

Five previous courses were easy, but this one has tough multiple choice quizzes, and very hard final project. My advice is to study every week hard and don't go further if you don't understand EVERY part of this course (on final project you would need all of the knowledge)",0,1,Zejd Imamović,15210237
