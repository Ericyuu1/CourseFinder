The way material is presented is outdated, dry, and confusing. If all you are looking for is a collection of theoretical articles and chapters about e-learning, then this is great. But if you are looking for an engaging and relevant course about e-learning, this is NOT for you. These instructors need to remember the sayings ""practice what you preach"" and ""lead by example"". I am floored that these instructors can title this course ""Innovated Approaches to Teaching in the Digital Age"" and give students text PDFs, text PDFs, more text PDFs, and a couple magazine articles and boring videos. This review may sound too harsh but these instructors need a serious wake up call.",0,1,Erika Kisonas,121315629

The multiple platforms (Coursera AND Scholar) don't talk to each other in terms of getting credit for the work done. As a result, you sit around waiting for someone to review your written response and can't finish the course.

It talks about active learning but is actually based on watch videos, write an “update” and then review peer work.  The peer work of many does not follow the prompt at all.  Then 3 other “peers” review your work with possibly no comments on improvements or that they can’t follow the link you share. No valid comments- but yet you are to resubmit?  The peers could be one of the many that did not follow the prompt.  Very dissatisfied with the e-learning. There also seems to be nowhere to ask for technical help in regards to the url link to your post not being hyperlinked.  Also the points distribution is not appropriate.  Research shows that “peers” are tougher on grading other peers as that is not in their repertoire.  Horrible!    Nothing like a Professor-student relationship.",0,4,LaNessa Hof,75588344

Don't expect academic rigor.The professors essentially delivered the content in ways they said NOT to deliver content (stand in front of a boring visual and talk AT your class; have students do discussion questions). I found myself skipping the videos and only reading the transcripts. It was quicker and made me realize there was nothing in any of the videos that made video a preferred medium to deliver content. Why sit through 5-15 minutes of someone talking/reading their notes when I could read the page and get more from it? What a waste.Beyond that, the peer grading of assignments was foolish. Some of the grades/feedback I got from peers showed they did not actually read my full response or pay attention to the question asked of us. One person even said it seemed I hadn't watched the video--even though I quoted directly from the video and responded to it. In a different assignment I brought in relevant links and details that I have found/used/learned in my work as a college professor already versed in digital learning, but my classmates gave me a failing grade. When I revised my assignment to only reference Wikipedia instead, it got a full score. Baffling. My only take-away from this course is how NOT to do an online course.",0,32,Juliette Ludeker,1274193
