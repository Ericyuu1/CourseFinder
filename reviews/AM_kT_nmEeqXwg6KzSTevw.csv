Occasionally, though, I felt there was a gap between what was taught and what was tested.  Perhaps that was the intent so that learners would push themselves beyond the presented material.

103974991~COURSE!~AM_kT_nmEeqXwg6KzSTevw,1653424215636,4,0,"Instructor quite a good presenter of this material, generally not stiff and pretty colloqial in his language.  Made the material interesting and not overy theoretical.  I think a couple of the test/quiz questions were not fairly graded ( thought my answer was identical to the shown correct answer); but it was not often enough to be material to my end result. I would certianly recommend this course for the material, and be more likely to take a course with this instructor.",0,0,John L Cardos,103974991

948351~COURSE!~AM_kT_nmEeqXwg6KzSTevw,1631308435099,5,0,"This is the second module of the specialization in calculus, go through these lectures in sequence since the concepts build on each other. The explanations are very clear and even the real world examples are superb. The motivation for learning all these concepts is baked into these lectures through the examples. Would definitely recommend solving the quizzes and sample problems. The professor also explains some historical math while going through the lectures such as where does 360degree come from. Thank you professor for all these lectures.",0,0,Don Jacob,948351
