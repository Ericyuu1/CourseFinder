The quizzes can be safely tackled by going through 5% of the coursework and that is being generous. A deficit that a programming section could easily overcome.I do feel bad for the instructors, i am sure it is not what they had in mind when they set out to design the course.

42384945~COURSE!~gHycGx0uEeaP7xL2JHHq4w,1569696560510,2,0,"It looks like the course was influenced by reviews from 'Cloud Computing Concepts, Part 1' course that contained complaints about the programming assignment, fast pace of the course and complex quizes. (I don't share these complaints, for me that course was incredible)This course gives a too high-level overview of the topics presented. Also, like in the previous part of the course, Mr. Campbell's lectures are too long, boring and hard to understand. This is disappointing since the topics in his lectures are really imporant. The quizes are too easy, no programming assigment, there's just no chance to check if you understood the material deep enough.Spark, CAP theorem, Storm and a lot of other stuff is covered by Cloud Computing Concepts in a more informative and compact way.Almost no imformation about the TensorFlow. It deserves at least a lessson devoted to it.

I believe the course is a lot more relevant if you tried out some cloud framework (i.e. play with one of the Docker or Vagrant VM demos)
The lecturers are clear, and the audio and slides are of good quality. One of the most valuable pieces of information from this course (that you cannot easily discern from reading documentation on each framework) is how the lectures link strengths or weaknesses in a technology or algorithm to its inner-workings.
One small nitpick is that the quiz questions could be improved. A lot of them is regurgitation of definitions (or regurgitation of the order of bullet points in a slide somewhere), rather than analytical style questions that require the user to think of the concepts. The end result is that the quizzes are very easy but not valuable. I assume this course had assignments before, but they appear to have been removed.",0,0,Patrick Santos,5671247
