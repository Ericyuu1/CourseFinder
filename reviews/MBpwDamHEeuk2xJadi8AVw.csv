From Parsons I've been expecting excellent lecturer - it was fullfilled. Is it a chapter about AI? Yes, I've found some great new insights. Is it about research? Well yes but it doesn't give me anything what I couldn't explore on my own and it doesn't give anything for someone who is a designer. Business Innovation? Few minutes of videos and materials is not  even touching the topic in way it could be considered valueable. I don't know. I've had higher expectations.",0,2,Ernest Warzocha,1427998
