78494208~COURSE!~-nHVR6XDEeiCoxKpzipawg,1639340837819,2,0,"TLDR: The course introduces FPGA design nicely and gives people who don't know where to start a nice path to follow. However, blatant errors and misleading information built into assignments, quizzes, and readings make for many headaches. Check the forums for help.The good: This course is reasonably good at introducing FPGA concepts, terminology, and design methods to students who already have a superficial understanding of integrated circuits. It provides a nice path for those who don't know where to start when trying to learn FPGA. It also briefly goes into some of the more interesting features of FPGAs, without getting into textbook levels of detail. Most or all of the readings can be found free online.The bad: Some of the programming assignments are unclear in the instructions, leaving out important details. They also contain misleading code at times. Why is a reset signal provided if it's never used in the simulation? Why do the instructions tell me to use an increment signal to increase a counter, but then the simulation holds these increment signals high the entire time? These kinds of bizarre discrepancies between instructions and what is actually happening make the assignments a huge pain at times. Quizzes can be equally confusing. Some of the readings teach FPGA programming concepts but don't use proper syntax in their examples. The ""Introduction to Verilog"" text in particular has LOTS of errors.Professor Scherr will step through the code in some slides and explain what it's doing, which is helpful. Professor Spriggs points to code in slides and doesn't tell you what's happening. If you're already very familiar with programming this might not be a big deal, but it left me with lots of questions and no answers.Overall I would recommend this course as a starting point, but would suggest outside resources for further learning. If you're stuck on something, don't think about it too hard and just check the forums. Your issue could likely be a flaw in the assignment/quiz.",0,2,Alex Wheeler,78494208
