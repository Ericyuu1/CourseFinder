60941023~COURSE!~ahbOnuP5EeaUXhIpi7MC6A,1592842731517,3,0,"Course is good, but material is too theoretical. Some more practical orientation is requested. Also, in some assessments, the choices/options given are too close and more than one appear appropriate, even after going through the lessons over and over again. Since 3 attempts are allowed, it becomes a matter of trail and error, rather than a well-informed decision, which it otherwise ought to be. Some case studies, even if only for reading (not grading), can be of immense help, especially if they offer some insights on the planning and implementation of HIT/HIE, etc.",0,1,sanjeev sharma,60941023

41195652~COURSE!~ahbOnuP5EeaUXhIpi7MC6A,1667076775755,4,0," This introductory course overlaps with and complements the HI-FIVE Clinical Perspective offering, also from the same institution, in terms of content. The focus of the material is on the technical-analytical aspects of health informatics that a conventional physician is not expected to grasp naturally. Like the Clinical Perspective course, finishing the material won’t make one operationally competent in health informatics. However, the bird’s-eye view it provides is highly appreciated. My main issue with the course, as with the Clinical Perspective offering, is that the presentation seemed bland. The content is also due for massive updating.  ",0,0,Aedrian Abrilla,41195652

58465900~COURSE!~ahbOnuP5EeaUXhIpi7MC6A,1588620569788,4,0,I definitely wasn't ready for it to be over! There was one section I believe in section 3 where the wrong text did not match up with the slides or the audio. I would have loved a little more time spent on understanding the calculation of risk adjusted index's as well as c-statistics. Other than that I definitely now know how much I don't know about the Informatics in Healthcare world but I'm definitely intrigued to learn more. ,0,0,Laurel Hootstein,58465900
