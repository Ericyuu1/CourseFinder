Half the course was just them trying to convince me the value of branding, but why else am I here? The assignments and grading is laughable, I would really suggest they relook at their rubric system, it does not matter how good or bad the quality of the work you do is, as long as you've included the sections they ask. I've come out of the course with almost no new knowledge of branding strategies, no new knowledge of what makes a strategy effective, how to properly analyse data, how to properly asses and understand your target segments and test. The only thing this course has done is tell me the importance of a having a target segment, which is quite condescending in my opinion.

The only downside I would say is the peer reviews - I spent a lot of time on my assignments and then when I came to score other peoples the scoring system was so simple and just asked questions like 'did they include this' rather than scoring it on the quality and accuracy of the work.

There are no questionnaires/quizzes like in other courses (there is only one and it is only 10% of the grade). Most of the assignments are peer reviews, and sometimes even if you send the thing on time, you get reviewed by only one person and have to deal with his/her subjectivity.

Of course, I understand that an online course like this, only four weeks long, can barely skim the surface of what is the formation of a brand, but still, I am left with the feeling that I could have been better conceived to cover a broader base of the discipline.Personally, I did not mind the amount of work and assignments required because I feel practical work is a must for learning such abstract concepts and theories. I do think, though, that sometimes the assignments were unclear or confusing, and also the review sections sometimes did not match up to the instructions which made the evaluations more difficult.
