110135031~COURSE!~tpnHZ7eaEeuhvApQ-8cGMw,1658260246549,5,0,"I really liked the information and found this course very helpful in understanding the relationship between economics and climate change. It basically made me understand climate change in different aspects and then also related it with economics as well. Also the Excel parts were new to me and I felt very satisfied with myself intellectually since it made me see the points I read and learned about as graphs. The graphs and data analysing made all the information look biref but efficient. Over all really enjoyed it and as a high school student, even I could understand and process every information.",0,0,Ayten Nehir Ören ,110135031
