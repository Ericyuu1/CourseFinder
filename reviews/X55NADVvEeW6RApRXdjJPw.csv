He's too lazy to even type out the codes and has the world's most monotonous voice. He pauses often to read this notes and has 0 enthusiasm teaching this class. If this class is not part of the certificate specialization, i wouldn't even pay for this course. $64 gets you further with Nick Walter or Rob Percival's Udemy course. ",0,3,Ben Wong,20345797

25095166~COURSE!~X55NADVvEeW6RApRXdjJPw,1500694754094,2,0,"This is the 5th course in the “iOS Development for Creative Entrepreneurs” specialization. This could have been a great course, but sadly it has several flaws.1) The target audience seems to be individuals who have never programmed before. Not students half way through the iOS specialization.2) The material is based on Swift 2 which is fairly outdated as of this writing (July 2017).  The current version is Swift 3.1 with Swift 4 waiting in the wings.3) The presenter for most of the course is hard to understand both verbally and code wise.  To complicate matters, the videos are low quality which makes following along with the code difficult and can be frustrating if debugging is not your strong suit.4) Optionals are a big part of Swift, but are still a fairly new topic for many programmers.  The course used optionals but did not explain what they were or how they were used.IMHO, Coursera should contract with Don Patterson, the instructor for the other 5 parts of the iOS specialization, to create an updated Swift 4 course that better integrates with the iOS specialization.I would have dropped this cause but it is required for the “iOS Development for Creative Entrepreneurs” specialization.",0,10,Steven Marcotte,25095166
936041~COURSE!~X55NADVvEeW6RApRXdjJPw,1476109168063,2,0,"Week 4 was particularly tough to get through.  Instructor seem uninterested, and the constant hair flipping was distracting.  Videos came through blurry despite using ""high quality"" settings.  There was a lot of code to get through that could have been better organized.  On a few occasions, I had to back-track through the videos to find something I missed.  And, in one area, instructor had to go back and fix something but didn't bother to provide guidance as to were to go and do this yourself.  In the end, I gave up following along with the videos and built the app using my own research.",0,0,Ken Courville,936041

IOS, swift and Xcode have changed significantly since this course was written. And whilst it is theoretically possible, with a lot of hard work & research, to update the code yourself, the resources required to complete the final project (ie the API) simply do not exist anymore. Barring writing your own API (which is vastly beyond the scope of this course), the final graded project is impossible to complete.This is such a shame because the quality & content of this course would be fantastic with a little updating.Please update this course coursera!",0,4,Penny,66143339

3798708~COURSE!~X55NADVvEeW6RApRXdjJPw,1497359678980,3,0,"The course is ambitious and thorough in its instruction, but is badly in need of an update. Swift 4 is now on the horizon (previewed already at WWDC 2017), but this course teaches version 2.0. The language has evolved significantly (3.1 as I write this review). Not only does the learner miss out on many of the new features, but quite a few things in this course are simply not true anymore, and will be contradicted by the Apple documentation. In effect, to pass the quizzes for this course, you have to give an answer that was true for obsolete Swift 2.0, but it false for current XCode and Swift development.Aside from this, the two programming assignments are weak. The first is trivial, and the second is a nicely complex implementation of swift and iOS, but the learner is only responsible for making minor changes before submitting.Redo the course with Swift 3.1 and XCode 8.3.",0,0,Matthew McGuire,3798708
