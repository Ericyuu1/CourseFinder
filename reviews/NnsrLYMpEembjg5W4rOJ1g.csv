But it was optional for the grading, so was not an issue. I’d have liked it to work though.This course really opens up your horizons to  the world of computer vision. So I’d highly recommend it to you even if you’re not doing the IBM certification as it introduces to a very interesting open source library called OpenCV. Some (marketing style) material regarding IBM is expected. But I felt it was a bit of an overkill (especially In the first week). Fortunately all down to studying thereafter!",0,1,Rohit Bhingare,22935095
