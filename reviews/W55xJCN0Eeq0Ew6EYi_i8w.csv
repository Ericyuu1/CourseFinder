When the instructor shows a (very basic) integral and reassures us that even if we don't know what it is, we will be alright, he is pushing it too much. Anyone who hasn't seen an integral like that before is not in the audience of the course anyway. The projects are very interesting and relevant, it is a pity they have been dumbed down in the execution to the point that we are required to fill in missing lines at specific places.

The labs are amazing, as they really help understanding the models and how to use them. Some recommendations:- I really like the way that the course is structured and that you are beginning with naive and easy solutions to come up with better ones, but sometimes it wasn't explicit enough that they where naive solutions while you were presenting them. Therefore it was a bit frustrating because during the first videos, i was always like ""Oh man why is he doing that? I have a better way!""... only to realize that you were about to present something better afterward -  Too many pure computation questions in the quiz... I find it useless to have questions with a formula and the data and we only need to understand how the formula is applied... It is too easy and it doesn't help understand deep meanings and explanations.- The quizzes are not mandatory to pass the course and they should be!- When a model is presented in the video, you could also explain how it is going to be trained, because sometimes i didn't know if some weights that you were talking about were learned or were just hyper parameters (ex: in basic models exemples of week 1)Another example is at final week, in the video 'survival tree', you manually split the data but you don't explain how the survival tree will be trained, now that we don't have a labelled outcome 1 or 0 associated with each patient.- It is not stated if the models and solutions that you are presenting are the state of the art, or if we should investigate more.- It would be nice, for each course, to have an exemple of solution that is already used by some hospitalsDon't hesitate to reach out to me if some of my recommendations are not clear enough... My english isn't perfect :) Thanks again, i'm looking forward to do the last course!",0,2,Harold Somers,18748347
