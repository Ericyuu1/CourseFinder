It’s especially disappointing after taking the fantastic specialization by Andrew Ng, and makes this specialization feel like a cheap cash grab by Coursera and DeepLearning.ai. This series of courses fails to prepare you for three reasons:1 – The certification exam is done on whatever is the current version of Tensorflow (v2.6 as of writing). You can’t expect a specialization like this to update every minor release, but much of the coding is still on the v1.X version!2 – The certification exam requires you to work in the PyCharm IDE. The IDE doesn’t even get a mention in this specialization and it is all done through Google Colab.3 – The material is covered at a very superficial level. I was hoping to walk out of it feeling confident in using Tensorflow on novel problems, but I’ve barely learned anything about Tensorflow that I didn’t already get from Andrew Ng’s specialization. There’re a few minutes of lectures (some weeks less than 10 minutes). The programming assignments are either pathetically easy, or lack any guidance on what to do (seriously sometimes there’s no instructions at all, you have to guess what to do by the variable names), or both.

 overview of applying tf.keras to this topic.  Machine learning is 
clearly a practical discipline (i.e. theory alone will not get you 
there), so I appreciated the chance to write some code and read a decent
 amount of code.Laurence Moroney is a good, upbeat instructor.All
 the courses within the Tensorflow in Practice specialization on 
Coursera may be most beneficial after first taking Andrew Ng's course on
 AI (also Coursera), but if you know something about loss functions, 
gradient descent, and backpropagation (which can be learned 
quick-and-dirty online), then you should be fine to go ahead and take 
this specialization before Professor Ng's course.My one 
persistent wish for all four of the courses in this specialization is 
that significantly more time be spent on understanding the shapes of 
tensors as they flow through the models.  Invariably, the only areas 
that gave me real problems as I did the coding homework were those where
 my tensor shape did not match what the model needed to see.  
Documentation at Tensorflow.org was of little help with this topic.  
Looking at Stackoverflow, it is apparent that there are certain 
(unwritten?) facts about the order and count of dimensions for the 
tensors as they flow through, e.g. batch count is listed first, time 
step is second, frame is third, or something like that.  What if I have twelve dimensions in my tensor?  Do certain model layers require a minimum number of dimensions of input or output?  etc. etc.Finally,
 this specialization really teaches the tf.keras  framework, not 
Tensorflow itself, which I do not think was explained in the course 
info, but maybe I missed it.  Still  - keras is probably a good way to enter the subject.All in all, I do know a lot more than I did before, and have acquired new skills.  Clearly, there's more to work on, which is good.",0,0,John Killea,50153384

     layers such as CNN, LSTM, RNN, Conv1D, DNNKnows learning rate rough

to improve:Fix the typos, such as
