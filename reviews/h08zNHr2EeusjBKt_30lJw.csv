The quizs often has nothing to do with the reading materials. Some questions will mark your choice wrong even when the explaination says you are correct.,0,0,James Fang,6135306
9447702~COURSE!~h08zNHr2EeusjBKt_30lJw,1673403384105,2,0,"The course is nothing more than reading documentation on other websites. There is no actual educational material in this course from LearnQuest. Also, there are numerous mistakes in the quizzes, in that you can answer a question correctly, yet still get marked wrong. In fact, on one of the ungraded quizzes, you can give the correct answer and get credit for it, yet in the graded exam itself, you don't get credit for the exact same answer. That is unacceptable. This course had no QA whatsoever, I feel. I gave it two stars, rather than just one, since there is some educational value from the third party resources, but from LearnQuest itself, virtually none.",0,0,Dan Tinsley,9447702
