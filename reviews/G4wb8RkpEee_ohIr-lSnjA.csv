I truly understand that some of the materials on bioinformatics pipelines and tools here are outdated and require updates, e.g., the use of KMA instead of MGmapper for alignment purposes, tibble instead of tidy function (broom package) for analyzing data frame in R env. etc  Nevertheless, I really enjoy learning all the materials provided in this course and looking forward to other similar workshops/trainings on metagenomics.
