71053548~COURSE!~wl1_Y94qEeimBhLzG9huFg,1603234452720,1,0,"Granted, this is a swiftly evolving space, but course materials are quickly outdated.  More problematic is that the scoring system across the entire Esports specialization is a poor one: based on the math, any marks off in a peer review and one is likely to fail (less than 70%) and honest assessments across different language barriers on subjective reports make failing likely.  It is hard to re-submit and get another review.  This was my most frustrating experience on Coursera and more students seemed inclined to ""game"" their grades in a way that was due to frustration with poor course and grading construction.  Several complained high-level work was not rewarded and also went un-reviewed for some time.  It's an important specialization to include, but this is genuinely poorly done as it stands.

Below is why.The course is ok-ish, if you have no idea what Esports is about. But the information provided in this course is grossly outdated - all links and videos date back to 2017. Considering how fast Esports industry is growing, it’s kinda ridiculous to learn about it while reading articles and watching videos that are 4 years old. Besides, the peer-to-peer assignment review system doesn’t suit me. I don’t want my assignments to be reviewed by people who are the same learners as me and whose English is not native. I’m not being snooty because I, too, am not a native English speaker. It’s just I received somebody’s assignment for a review and was shocked how poorly it was written and presented. I immediately imagined that my assignment could have been reviewed by this person who was clearly not able to put two words together. Moreover, it seemed like he could not care less. My approach to studying is quite serious: I apply myself 200%. I put a lot of effort into completing my assignments, sticking to all the requirements: diligently researching the subject, carefully checking my spelling, punctuation and grammar; submitting it in time, even earlier if I can, and according to the essay formatting rules. But what’s the point to try so hard if you are studying a subject based on the outdated info and your essays are evaluated by people who clearly don’t care? Waste of time I’d say which is a shame because this was my first experience with Coursera. ",0,1,Anna Kavanagh,82597390

They give you the rubric up front, but don't give you the actual criterion until you have finished the assignment and are ready to submit it.  The assignments are supposedly peer reviewed, but if that's the case, some A-Hole failed me on the very first one.  I know I didn't write anything ground breaking, but damn, give me enough points to pass.  There is no way that paper was not good enough to move on.  It was literally about what makes a good Esports game.  Are you seriously telling me someone else, in my same position, read my paper and thought, ""no, this isn't worth 7 out of 10 points to move on."" Give me a break.  Who the fuck does that? If you're paper makes sense and is comprehensible, I will absolutely give you 7 out of 10, if not more.  What bullshit. ",0,0,Jared Cantrell,45713928
