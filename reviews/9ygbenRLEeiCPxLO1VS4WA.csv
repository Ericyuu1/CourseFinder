8179201~COURSE!~9ygbenRLEeiCPxLO1VS4WA,1626062640211,1,0,"Very hard course, especially with no background. They assume by demonstrating the words, that you know the meaning but no where do they confirm the meaning so you could be misinterpreting the words. Second is they do no teach characters but other than the first 60 seconds when the characters are shown, you are miraculously suppose to recognize the characters. The quizes include choosing tones but they don't really teach or review the tones. I've take Mandarin before and know some characters. I found this course to be too hard. Do not recommend for complete beginners. Better suited for someone who has learn Chinese and stopped for a while and want to review it again. If you are complete beginner, you will be lost and frustrated, though not because you can't learn but because this course is badly designed for beginners.

I will tell you everything that is wrong with the first part of the first week. I didn't continue because, despite how much the instructor keeps on saying ""we learned,"" there is no learning experience.This is my opinion as a high beginner Chinese learner and as a foreign language teacher: There is too much vocabulary and too many characters. Learners of Chinese with no knowledge of Chinese characters need a phonetic system such as hanyu pinyin not tens of Chinese Characters.The instructor introduces characters, but does not clarify the meaning. The students in the videos use words that translate to please, drink, tea, very, etc., which the true learner won't get from the videos on this course.And the most ridiculous part is, besides the poor audio quality, the lip-reading quizzes! What language skill is lip-reading?

While the material itself is not difficult, I found this course incredibly difficult due to the teaching format.  New vocabulary is introduced in-context, however the video role plays in which they were introduced were at times very unclear, and in many scenarios I could not hear the audio clearly. I had to pre-teach new vocabulary to myself using other resources before beginning the lesson to comprehend what was happening. Each lesson teaches about 40-50 new words, which I found to be overwhelming with not enough tasks provided to really practice the new words. This course also teaches traditional characters, not simplified ones, which made memorization very difficult, and reading a struggle that, in the end, made me lose motivation. As a first-time learner, I do not know if this is how Chinese is usually taught, or if it was a choice made by the course instructor. I also would have appreciated some time dedicated to learning correct stroke order.While the teacher is clearly very passionate about teaching Chinese, and the course uses many interesting and at times funny video role plays, I found the course difficult for the above reasons. I will continue to learn Chinese, but perhaps through another platform.

I went through the course very slowly and it was not my only source for learning.  Additionally, I'd had some solid basic Chinese language study before taking this. The videos are of limited value because the sound quality is quite poor and everybody speaks enormously fast (you can slow the speed). I spent most of my time studying the video transcripts and getting all the vocabulary down with other supporting materials before I even tackled listening to the videos. I am glad I took the course because it is the only Chinese language course on Coursera with traditional Chinese script and it covers a huge range of vocabulary, BUT it requires a lot of supplementation and needs some improvement. A true beginning course would have much more limited vocabulary (200 words max) and a lot more repetition. That may be hard to do in the MOOC environment.

77867606~COURSE!~9ygbenRLEeiCPxLO1VS4WA,1643050268231,3,0,"Generally a decent course that certainly led me to be able to start understanding Mandarin Chinese.  It may seem like stating the obvious, but it needs to be conducted with a dictionary facility to hand (e.g. yabla online dictionary), because it quickly became clear that you won't get the meanings of the words and phrases just by following the course.  An early example is the relatively simple phrase ""yŏu shì"" which, when it is presented, could easily have a number of possible meanings.  I guessed the wrong one & was confused for some time after until I looked it up online.One possible defect of the course arises in the presentation of the written words.  First, you don't realise that all the quizzes are going to be written ones and secondly, you are presented with the TRADITIONAL written words but then questioned using their MODERN written counterparts, which don't always match and so the task of learning is made that much harder.  Not insurmountable, though.  A bigger problems arises with the end-of-section quizzes.  Some of the things being asked need a degree of explanation.  For example, each test contains a few questions in which you are asked to arrange words in the ""correct"" order, presumably to form a proper sentence.  I never got this.  It didn't seem to matter which order I chose, the answer always appeared to be wrong.  This is not helped by the fact that some of the words don't seem to be there; they are just simply missing.  For example, you'll be asked to put words A, B, C, D and E in the correct order, but word D will just be a blank space.  This is just one of the course deficiencies that could do with some attention from the organisers.  All in all, though, it is still a reasonable course and provides a good start.",0,0, Robin Jukes,77867606

Unfortunately, it's lacking in English subtitles and/or materials, which I was desperately trying to volunteer and add.  However, I can't seem to add ""English"" into my translation account profile.  I've already added Chinese (Traditional).In the interim, I've added some translations into the respective forums which I hope other students will find useful.The instructor has excellent pronunciation for all the words presented.  The additional staff add interesting and sometimes hilarious skits to introduce new sentences to Chinese learners.  (Kudos to the American staffer/actor.  His Chinese pronunciation is awesome!)Hopefully, this course will be updated and pass QA before the next iteration.  Thank you and hopefully more will follow!Suggestion - As an option, please include ZhuYin phonetics in the course.  Thank  you!",0,0,Terence Jeffrey Way,3574648
