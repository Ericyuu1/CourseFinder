The video on Positive Intervention and the assignment there off for Week 3 seemed to have absolutely no connect. This could have been incorporated with the Positive Intervention specialization itself than creating a 5th part altogether.

4455733~COURSE!~75TPppoQEeaeaRLE7qfOBA,1507483044154,2,0,"Qualification: this is my judgment of this course after having done the entire Positive Psychology Specialization in order.Very little content. It mostly consists of repeated content from the other courses in the specialization. Some of the interviews are new and useful, but ultimately all the content is very short-lived and repetitive. Also, many of the peer-review assignments had rubrics that didn't really match the prompt, and felt rotten. The way an assignment is graded should not come as a surprise. Grading hard is good, but only if it's fair.My suggestions for this course: - The course needs to use only unique content, and it was short on content already. Otherwise it's just a waste of time and money. It didn't take much time to do anything and I didn't get much out of the course that I didn't already get from an earlier course. - The peer assignment prompts need to match the rubrics used to grade them (this was most noticeable for the last two weeks). Otherwise the peer grading won't matter at all. - There was too little time to judge the intervention. Developing and using the intervention should happen in the first week. Maybe if there's enough time, we could actually try out a peer's intervention!",0,8,Bridger Howell,4455733

It looks nice but although I'm fully aware it's not worth an on campus diploma, half of the text written on it is to say how low quality it is related to a full on campus degree. And it's written twice !  Even the idea that someone else could have followed the course is too much in my opinion.  I was proud and eager to receive it but it lowered a bit the sense of positive sensations I should have felt when looking at it for the first time.Here's the text written twice on the certificate :""The online courses named in this certificate may draw on material from courses taught on-campus, but it is not equivalent to an on-campus course.

It is interesting. It is filled with inspiration and tools. Angela Duckworth is a charming and positive teacher. It is also great to be taught by such a top figure in Positive Psychology - Martin Seligman. I have scores of books from the library in my home to continue my education - these were gleaned from the references of these courses. The assignments were just right - requiring thoughtfulness and stretching. In fact, these were some of my favorite assignments. I am a frequent user of Coursera. I would recommend that the course work be scored by three students and averaged - rather than by one student. Using one student only can be a bit weak and skewed in both directions.  I would also like a required comment on the assignment scoring. I have experienced both of these in other Coursera classes. I learned a good deal by scoring the assignments - and I am delighted that there is little or no limit in that direction. This is the first Special Project paid course set that I have taken.  I am quite pleased. Thank you. ",0,2,Susan Miller Madeley,1426649

I do have an issue with the peer graded assignments though. Not everyone's understanding of the subject can be  the same, hence varying levels of comprehension lead to disappointing grades. Peers grading the assignments do so based on what they have gleaned from the content, and when someone does so to a well written, well researched, and well thought of assignment, it's quite unfortunate. Perhaps the teaching assistants should be doing this, with in-depth understanding of he subject. ",0,0,Mala Dasgupta,25947455
