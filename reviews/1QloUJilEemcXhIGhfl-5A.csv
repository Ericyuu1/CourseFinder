70121716~COURSE!~1QloUJilEemcXhIGhfl-5A,1676746232815,4,0,"I decided to take the course because of issues that were being raised during the course of the war in Ukraine and some of the rhetoric being used on both sides of the conflict - as well as some of the discussion revolving around  Iran and Israel and their place in the conflict as well. It's a sign of how volatile this topic is that when I told a friend I was taking a course on anti-semitism she asked me cautiously if it was a course in favor of or against anti-semitism! I told her that I would not be interested in taking a course that tried to justify anti-semitism - but what I liked about this one was that it tried to explain what it was,  why it existed and how it had evolved and changed over time. I particularly liked the survey nature of the course and that it covered the phenomenon of anti-semitism from its beginnings in the Graeco-Roman world to the modern era. Even when scholars spoke from a certain bias, it was also clear that they spoke out of a large base of knowledge on the area and were aware of the complexity of the definitions, issues and discussion around them. I also liked the bibliographies for further reading. My only real quibble - and I've had it with other Coursera courses - is that the grading mechanism left something to be desired. I was glad that this one didn't rely on multiple-choice questions, and opted for short answer and paragraph instead. But I was sad that none of the discussion work along the way counted towards the final grade. There was also a problem with the final exam asking students to only answer 4 of the 15 questions (though students could answer more if they wished for extra credit). But many of us then discovered that the system would not accept our exams unless we answered ALL of the questions observing the minimum word count in each. This needs to be fixed. Outside of this, I enjoyed the course and felt I got what I was looking for in it.",0,0,Moira Day,70121716
112860770~COURSE!~1QloUJilEemcXhIGhfl-5A,1663971576165,4,0,A​ good course overall.  I think it is lacking in the 2000 year history to the present age and dont subscribe to all your conclusions.  I also think the emphasis on legislation as a solution to antisemetism is short sighted and missses the mark.  Nevertheless it is as i said a good course and something that should be required learning.,0,0,KIP BROWN,112860770

However, during this course I had a few assignments/comments to complete so I clicked on reset schedules/assignments and unfortunately nothing was reset. I therefore continued to finish the course by viewing the rest of videos and reading the articles as I didn't get to complete a few assignments/comments.    ",0,3,Michelle Ali ,56836678

I would suggest that even if you do not subscribe for the certificate, you answer the discussion questions. They provide much neede time to reflect on the various stages of the course material,helping to reinforce what is being taught. An excellent course, and historical fact and context are easily relatable to events which are occurring  globally in our world today. A good base course on which to build for future learning on this topic.",0,0,Marilyn Kaufman,111865009

It was eye opening to see how many centuries antisemitism has been in the world and how it came about.  The root causes are so deep, it may take another 100 years to eradicate the myths and lies about the Jewish people.  Must take this course to understand why there is such a hatred of the Jewish people by some many cultures.  (I Love Israel!!)",0,1,valorie hamachek,1900832
