By taking this guided project I worked on Excel where I used financial formulas such as Stdev, VAR & COVAR to decipher the beta (systematic risk) and overall risk (systematic and unsystematic) of the single stock and portfolio. Moreover, I have learnt about alpha which shows how one's investment choice performed well compared to the proxy market or an index.
