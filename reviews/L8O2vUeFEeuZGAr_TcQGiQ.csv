13430936~COURSE!~L8O2vUeFEeuZGAr_TcQGiQ,1638128369044,3,0,"The course covers some interesting aspects of Material Science, in particular what concerns steels and metal alloys. However in other important aspects of that Science, such as ceramics, composites, polymers, the coverage is sensibly lower, what in my view lowers also the general quality of the course, maybe opening up the possibility and opportunity of a second course dealing with those materials. I would also refer to some difficulties faced in the comprehension of the lessons given by the last professor (the person who has covered the final part of the course), may be due to the fact of not speaking English as a mother tongue level. In any case the course is interesting and I have gotten some new, fresh and valuable knowledge about engineering materials  ",0,2,Juan M Sansinenea,13430936
