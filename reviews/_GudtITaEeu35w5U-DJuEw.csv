116604246~COURSE!~_GudtITaEeu35w5U-DJuEw,1669615315526,1,0,"I'm having a tough time with these courses. The final projects are leaps above the quiz and homework assignments. The difficulty curve makes little sense. There is little to no engagement from the instructor or other students. Instructor will make a discussion prompt 3 months ago, but then never check in to see how the discussion is going or to give any feed back, any feed back that is given is a boilerplate ""over 200k students take this class, I can't answer everyone"" but then the instructor answers no one when they were the person who asked the question. 

I feel the biggest weakness of this class is that we are enslaved to the auto grader. So instead of approaching assignments with ""here is a problem, lets come up with solutions"" it's ""here's an incomplete solution to a problem with a scope limited to what can be graded automatically. Use the code I've provided to you and finish they program the way I would"" We're not programming or developing. We're adlibbing. 

I can't say I'm not learning anything. I actually am writing better programs than what the assignments are mandating. Which makes me resent the autograder even more. So I guess, I'm learning despite the course? At this point I don't know if I will continue with this ""Concentration"". I signed up to learn unreal and the amount of unreal I've actually learned in the 8 weeks since I started, I could have learned in 2 hours. Literally its just spawning teddy bears and clicking on the screen to make it move and pick up stuff. Ain't even animated. There's a pong tutorial for unreal on youtube that's 2 hours. 

oh, and all the lectures for this and the other 3 courses are already pirated and on youtube. So you don't even need a Coursera account to access this information. ",0,1,Binary Burnout 3D (Binary Burnout Studios),116604246
