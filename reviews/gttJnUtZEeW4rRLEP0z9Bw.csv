15260116~COURSE!~gttJnUtZEeW4rRLEP0z9Bw,1461700878679,2,0,"The course can be informative, but the presentation needs some work.  All of the instructional videos were merely a person reading a Power Point presentation to the viewer.  The ""in class"" examples appeared to be completely hypothetical and were also read to the viewer without any video demonstration of how the presented information works in an actual class.   In addition, the written information in the videos was confusingly organized and had not been fully edited.  In multiple videos, there were typos.  In at least one video, the instructors had not fully deleted the sentences from a previous version of a slide. When the revised slide was presented to the viewer,  a word from a previous version was in the middle of the sentence.  In addition, the previous version was obviously about a different subject.    I was disappointed and continually frustrated with this course, especially since the instructors required me to pay fifty dollars in order to take the module quizzes and the final assessment.  I have no problem paying for a good product.  However, the professionalism displayed in the course was incredibly lacking.    ",0,0,Colin de Leon - Horton,15260116
