Might be easy for Mainframe developers who are familiar with the ISPF/TSO, but then again why would they take an introductory certification like this?

Poorly laid out, sequence was confusing, and there were syntax and nomenclature errors throughout.Some documents (ex:TSO manual) were not included, and I found that to manage through some of the labs, I had to google many topics. The lectures were a high level overview of what might occur in the lab, providing little insight into why the tasks were being illustrated. Quizzes should have been after the labs instead of after the lectures. While most of the information in the quizzes were covered in the lecture, it lacked relevance to the lab. One lecture ""how to allocate a dataset, started with ""Now that we have allocated a dataset, let's go ahead and use it"" (I thought I had missed a section)Some of the hints were syntactically incorrect (ex. exercise 4: sort x a  2 13 a 18 31 is incorrect, the manual shows ascending or descending arguments after the range). Some entries in the lab noted incorrect screen options. Still, I derived som benefit fromtaking the class. I feel more comfortable moving around the ISPF screens and using TSO.
