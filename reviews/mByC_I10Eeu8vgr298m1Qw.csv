1947117~COURSE!~mByC_I10Eeu8vgr298m1Qw,1671118914547,1,0,"This was the least useful course in the product specialization. The videos are raw and unedited, frequently just editing multiple takes together. The presenter contradicts her slides, and other courses in the specialization. At times the presenter point blank says ""I don't use this"" about content she's presenting.The course has little depth to the content. It feels more like a flyby of bullet points.",0,0,Andrew Matteson,1947117

There are so many things wrong with this course that is hard to pick the most critical ones. - The instructor rambles so much and jumps from vague concepts to old practices and personal feelings.
- Most of the (superficial) explanations are hardware-oriented, but then the instructor switches to software products examples and it doesn't fit at all.
- Most of the sub-topics are totally out of context. This is a curse of Prototyping, if a topic is ""Open source"" one would expect to have some Open Source Tools for prototyping, but no, she talks about Open Source in general and rambles about a topic that is evidently out of her domain.
- The same for Testing. We are supposed to learn here how to test a PROTOTYPE and she rambles about general software testing, there's even a DevOps slide haha...and she concludes that this is too difficult for you and you better find someone who knows. Is this a joke?
- All the course she rambles about Agile and Lean, but in the PM module, she uses cascade-based and traditional PM   content.
- Finally, this is supposed to be a Course on Product Management specialization, a role which is not even mentioned. Ridiculous. 

And last but not least, please edit the videos and delete the bloopers. Is so unprofessional!Note for the instructor: Update yourself (get some Coursera courses maybe), go to therapy. ",0,8,Fernanda Montiel,41570
