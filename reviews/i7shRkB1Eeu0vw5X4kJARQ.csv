The quizzes and assignment questions could be improved by a lot as currently, they don't really do much in assessing how much one has learnt nor do they challenge you to delve deeper.T​he labs are well structured though it's best if the student is left to write their own code after an example has been shown, rather than have the code or part of it written for them in which case the learning is dampened a little. For support, the solution/hint may be hidden away somewhere for the student to view if they need assistance. T​he course was worthwhile, and I appreciate it.

This would help us prepare better.Nonetheless, the discussion forum was useful. I am glad the search box is there allow me to input the search on topic I needed most. There were some logistics issue like jupyter notebook wget unable to work. If should have  corner for new comer to go for, prerequisites. Let them know if they use anaconda jupyter notebook this is what they need. If they use win/mac then another approach. I spend some time figuring that out.
