This was the part of this specialization where I expected to unleash my creativity, and it's a pity that it turned out to be the weakest link. The instructor failed to instruct, simply said. Of course, imagemaking and creative arts in general, can't be easily systematized and subjected to measurable rules and conditions. However, the instructor made the whole course and the assignments incredibly confusing. I believe, such a teaching technique works in person, when all the questions and doubts can be cleared, the coursework follows a certain rhytm and develops naturally, an many iterations are possible. Unfortunately, the instructor's style doesn't translate well to online course. Discussion forum is full of people not sure what the assignments are about and the staff, although present and active, doesn't do more than copying and pasting same instructions the students are asking about, as if it made things clearer.

I enjoyed the exercises, though I would say that it is often not clear what aspects of the brief are a preference or a suggestion versus a requirement.

The design of each assignment is made to use your imaginations, hands on tools and materials. Love the videos, clear, to the point beautiful made.  Lots of room to work and do something quite good and unique if the student want!  I am really having fun!
Thank you!
