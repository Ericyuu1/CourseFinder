Further, sound quality and background noises were not the quality I expected/hoped for with a Coursera course.  The instructor was decent.  I don't think English is the native tongue of the teacher.  He is certainly fluent and capable, but the accent and sound quality combo might be a bit too much for some.  I had to turn my sound all the way up and eventually switch to headphones to catch what he was saying.  Perhaps younger ears won't have this issue.  ",0,0,Tammy C,25899742

I tried using closed captions because some things aren't in the same spot on the site or even called the same. So it took longer to figure out where I needed to click and do work. The formula is complicated and could have been put on the screen for a few frames when we pause to get a clear look at what to type. Another frustration was having to go back and forth between screens to see what to do and then do my work. But again, after figuring out how the two screens were laid out differently and where to find the new version. It honestly took me almost 4 hours to complete and I only kept pushing because I really wanted to learn how to use this software. If the captions were better, I guess watching on a tablet while working on the computer would work, but I tried this course because of the split screen option. ",0,0,Brittiany Hightower,8607159

76597588~COURSE!~XtkIpOliEeqVIgpj8IJl1w,1605412686310,3,0,"This is a pretty good course, but there are several major flaws. First, the instructor does not seem to have thought through some of the tasks. The way he has set up the data structure will not work as intended, and he does not seem to realize that his instructions are not going to work. For example, he instructs us to add a list component to the detail page that will list all previous reviews of a given book. He instructs us to create a filter for this list so that only the reviews for that title will appear on a particular book's page. However, he hard codes one book's title into the filter criteria. This means that every book's detail page will list the reviews for that same book that was hard coded into the filter. The filter criteria needs to be written dynamically so that it matches the title of whichever book's page the user is viewing. In order to do this, the filter criteria should reference the cell value of the title column in that book's row in the spreadsheet. I am too new to Glide to know whether this is possible in Glide, but if it isn't, then that filter feature is pretty useless. There is a similar problem with the way the instructor sets up the ""My List"" feature. He set up the data structure with one ListAdd column in the Books spreadsheet. This means that when any user adds the book to their list (i.e., sets that book's ListAdd value to true), then it will be true for ALL users. Every user will see that book in their list. If another user then removes that book from their list, the book's ListAdd value becomes false for ALL users. The book will be removed from everyone's lists. This My List feature would be better accomplished by creating a separate sheet, perhaps called UserLists, that would capture the user's email and the title of the book they add to their list. Then the My List feature in the app would list books from the UserLists sheet filtered by user email. Also, if this were going to be a real-world app, then the books need more than just a title to identify them because multiple books can have the same title. They need a unique identifier, such as the ISBN. I also could not use the Rhyme platform. The virtual desktop would not allow me to have more than one window open, so I could not switch between incognito and regular Chrome tabs. I also was not able to minimize Chrome to get to the actual virtual desktop. The window for the virtual workspace was too small to be useful. If you don't have a fairly large monitor, then you will have trouble with it. The quiz grading also needs to be reviewed to ensure it marks answers correctly.",0,6,Desiree W,76597588
