I was really looking forward to learning more about porfolio construction from a former Goldman Sachs employee, but that did not happen. The lessons were each structured as a very high-level overview and not as a deep dive. ",0,0,Eric Robbins,65394285

43993956~COURSE!~Vz6MxbvAEeW6QBIGzzljVw,1582386461139,5,0,This was the last course of five offered by Coursera  in association with Rice University to provide a specialization in Financial Markets. I took them all and learned a lot. The Capstone was in fact the practical use of the knowledge learned in the previous four courses. I do not hesitate to recommend this and the rest of the courses in this specialization. ,0,3,Guillermo Velasquez,43993956
