I started the mind shift course and finished it in a few days, remember taking quizzes and stuff, but I signed in today to coursera and it says I never completed the course and I missed deadlines. Very strange .That brings us to this course. A review by Joshua s. Stated - “It is so hard to learn from a professor who can't get through 2  sentences without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off  and not finishing her sentence, etc.” I have to agree this course needs structure, style, and a textbook. I listened to both presenters and have to agree that they both need to practice and perfect the presentation of the material. I decided that this course would not give me what I was looking for- which was not so defined, but maybe just a look at the subject. I’ve taken college human anatomy and physiology, but again it cut corners, and was not entirely what I was looking for. I see all the good reviews and am tempted, but can’t take the presentation at all it was very frustrating. I wish that when I hit the unenroll button something would happen- like unenrollment.",0,2,Andrew,58037108

As usual, the directions I received were inaccurate.  I must cancel because the course as presented is too far above my academic preparation in math and chemistry.  This is NOT an introductory course.  It is as challenging as the Vander text which I purchased to assist me.  I also purchased the supposed $5 notes for the course and printed them out.  Fooled again.  They bear no resemblance to the course materials.  By the way, I received a scholarship for the Certificate in this course based upon my performance in my two previous courses at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine and the University of Michigan.

51823961~COURSE!~Tr9rK6JtEeSwKiIACiONVg,1593311210254,2,0,"The primary reason for enrolling in the course was to enhance my knowledge base of human physiology. Although it has been many decades since I've taken anatomy and physiology as well as pathophysiology, I have taught it twice at the secondary level.  Upon reviewing the description of the course, it indicated that it was introductory, but knowledge of biology/science would be helpful, I thought it might be a great refresher course.  I beg to differ! This course WAS NOT introductory.  Let me give you the positives first: pdf's and readings were extremely helpful.  The negatives, the instructors were not impressive. One instructor talked absolutely too fast and much too often wouldn't complete the sentences OR she would repeat words or phrases that didn't make sense. I found it difficult to grasp the lecture when this instructor couldn't get through a sentence without stumbling over her thoughts, mumbling, trailing off and not finishing her sentence, etc. More often than not, the information provided in the lecture was inconsistent with the notes/pdf's. One other thing, she constantly smacked her mouth which was nerve-wrecking!  During the lectures, she would write on the powerpoints, which was either sloppy or not legible. After the fifth week, I honestly wanted to withdraw from the course, but decided to finish it out solely because it was half way completed and the time that had already been invested.  Many viewers gave the course 5 stars, I could not.  Although I completed the course with a 93.4% grade, the level of information was extensive, to some degree over the top.  The course needs to be restructured so that it stays within the context of an introductory course.  In my opinion, this course is more suitable for a first-second year medical student.  BTW, this is the sixth course that I have completed through Coursera, including a specialization.  Good luck!",0,17,Maxine L. Moore,51823961

The E-book is a life-raft!From the start, I realized this was NOT an anatomy course but plowed through. I learned key concepts of how the body and system worked. You need a background in anatomy to avoid transposing the many opposing, binary terms: such as “afferent arteriole” vs “efferent arteriole” as an example, which I did on exams. THE E-BOOK GOT ME UNSTUCK MANY TIMES, IT’S WORTH THE MONEY! I’m glad I paid attention in health class. I was able to calculate the equations accurately, as math doesn’t change much. However, I will need additional courses to retain the more detailed verbiage. The concepts, however, will stay with me for life.The surprising thing was how I applied it to things I’ve been doing wrong: not drinking much water, avoiding foods with potassium because of their carb content, coffee as a meal replacement--the advice of fad-diets or the business of life. It’s a miracle my kidneys aren’t 2 raisins. While I still love coffee, I drink potassium rich black tea and bought a water filter for great tasting water. When I exercised, I also overdid it, not focusing on breathing, or replacing electrolytes. Sugar, salt and even fats aren’t the enemy, but the excess or imbalance of these macronutrients and the failure to drink enough water to regulate the systems.",0,0,Amber Southard,68697407

Other reviews say this isn't really introductory or that it is advanced but this is not true. Yes, to study physiology you should already know some basic chemistry (ie. what pH is and pressure/volume, electric potential, what bicarbonate ion buffers are) and biology (know what a cell membrane is, basic transporters, ATP), but not much beyond high school / first year level so do those first if you haven't already. Maybe come in with some elementary anatomy too, like knowing where the pancreas and pituitary glands are. But these are just assumed prerequisites for any physiology course so I don't fault the instructors. Most videos give a good overview of the systems, glossing over some details. It was dry at certain points where I had to watch Youtube vids for clarity, but overall the videos and assessments were good. I got by without the readings, only using the slides and Dr. Mike Youtube videos to revisit topics I didn't understand the first time around. Physiology isn't an easy subject, but with some time and supplementary videos this course isn't too bad.",0,4,Jack,25965969

57560318~COURSE!~Tr9rK6JtEeSwKiIACiONVg,1602128374760,5,0,"Great things first: It’s a great course, with quite an
amount of information each video each module. For each week’s two to three
video hours, I spent 5 to 6 hours researching through googling or textbook
reading, and an intense note-taking all along. I highly recommend anyone who
wants a ‘warm-up’ in college physiology to do this course. This is perhaps a
first college level physiology, but it’s no way ‘introductory’. For a student with
mostly humanities background like me, it’s going to be a challenging course.
But it is really worth doing.The course’s texts (ebook), video-transcripts,
lectures, in-video questions, practice quizzes and graded quizzes are all very
helpful. It would be more helpful if explanation can be provided
for some quizzes’ questions.In some lectures, I found the explanation a bit
confusing. V/Q mismatch is an important topic in respiratory system. Week 6. At
5:07 of a video titled “CO2 Transport and V/Q Mismatch”, after a literal
explanation of what ‘Q’ and ‘V’ each stands for, I expect a concise explanation
of what V/Q Mismatch IS, but what I get is: “The idea is that even though we've been talking about the
lung as if it is the same in all regions, actually it is not. This is due
mostly to just gravity.” Dr. Cabrey is explaining why the bottom of the lung is
much more distensible (less compliant) than the top part of the lung. Of course
this is what the figure shown on the slide is about. But clearly the aim is to
illustrate the concept of V/Q Mismatch via the ventilation & perfusion
situation of the lung. But what is V/Q Mismatch in the first place? The
professor is no doubt very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the subject
material (which I really appreciate), but I would appreciate a teaching
approach which is more straightforward. Again, thanks to the
Teams at Duke and Coursera who make this course available. ",0,5,Calista Lam,57560318

I found this course challenging since it focuses more on the physiology of the human body in more detail than a regular my anatomy and physiology class back in high school. This course isn't really an ""introductory"" course, you may need some background on science courses like chemistry, biology, anatomy, and physiology (So keep that in mind if you want to enroll). I have a limited background in science these courses (Biology, chemistry, etc) and finished this course, and yes it is possible to finish this course without knowing all about science stuff, it just took a little more effort to quickly learn science terms and stuff. With all of that, the course was great and for a nursing major like me really helped me developed surface-level knowledge about the function of the human body. Lectures are good, a little fast for me but they provide great PDF that I can refer to. Practice quizzes did help me a lot, but I hope that they provide feedback or explanation on why I got it wrong instead of just showing ""correct"" or ""incorrect"".

Now I can take other, more specialized courses without having to Google every other word and actually understand the processes they're talking about instead of simply memorizing them. Especially, now that I am taking several other courses, I have the opportunity to appreciate the depth clever systematic approach to explain such complex processes of our body. Sometimes I got the feeling that I lack some background as many terms used to explain processes were not explained. But that was greatly compensated by teachers' and mentors' participation in the forum and answering questions on every subject. I was amazed that such free course offers the luxury of teachers replying to your questions, and this actually motivated me to study even more diligently. And yes, come up with new questions :) By the end of the course not all my questions were answered, but on the other side, without this course I never would even think of asking those questions about work of human body! Such great interest and inquiry have you wakened in me, thank you very much!I would like to note that the course used a wonderful array of tools to create understanding of the subject. One of the best was storytelling by Dr. Jakoi. Stories in the best way to learn as theoretical information is related to real-life situations, and in fact, I remembered all stories that she told, like stories about her son who had high parasympathetic tone, about guy who drank too much water to remove kidney stone, etc. Along with remembering the stories, I remembered the information it was about. One more thing I would like to note is that I liked your tests and practice quizzes. Not all courses have practice questions after the lessons and it’s excellent way to memorize info. Also, quizzes include tasks of application of knowledge in some practical situations - makes you think and analyze the info to explain real-life phenomena. It’s difficult to correctly reply to such questions only relying on information: you need understanding of the process. In this way, these are excellent quizzes.
