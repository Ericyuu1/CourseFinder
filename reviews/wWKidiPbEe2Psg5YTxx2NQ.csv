Things are regularly presented out of order, if at all. The peer assessment requirement is a royal pain, with people regularly not following instructions or not reading your submissions and just failing you for the hell of it. And, there's enough error present in the materials themselves that the legitimacy of the course is called into question in a very real way.  If IBM continues offering courses, they either need to hire a legitimate and trained curriculum development team and/or an editor and tester at the very least. ",0,1,Joshua M. Paiz,18903623
