17218122~COURSE!~_gIc1ph8EeuUXhLsIR-6gQ,1637334035881,2,0,"The course includes generalizations with very little academic support. The ""readings"" each week will be TED and TEDx talks that are a similar theme. If you're familiar with TEDx especially this is clearly a problem for content being presented as a university course. A lot of time and promotion is given to questionable self-help gurus or individuals that are pitching their book/program and evidence based content is less common. No one uses the discussion forums and the quizzes have frustrating errors. There doesn't seem to be a way to talk about or report these. The content of the course is comparable to watching random self-help videos on youtube. ",0,3,James L Martin,17218122

13773180~COURSE!~_gIc1ph8EeuUXhLsIR-6gQ,1643362941698,5,0,"It's a very informative and necessary course for all of us.  The title ""Life 101"" is truly the best description for it.  We usually don't pay enough attention to our everyday routine, and sometimes it causes many problems. This course & and Dr. Jafari say to you ""Wait for a moment, take a deep breath, look around and change everything you don't like in your life. Because you're strong enough to change it and good enough to deserve something bigger and better than you already have. But, always remember to be grateful for what you have.""

I think we all need these words from time to time. Moreover, these are not just words. Dr.Jafari gives you very powerful but easy tips and tools for changing. She doesn't tell give up on everything and start all over again. Change it piece by piece. This way is easy, better, more productive, and less stressful.

Many thanks to Dr.Jafari for this (one of the best I've even taken) course. It's so wholesome!
Be kind to yourself, mates, and take care <3",0,0,Maria Shumskaya,13773180
