26649119~COURSE!~T9LTbLhyEemEbAq6P05ilg,1635382698331,2,0,"Most quizzes in this course don't have enough questions to learn (1-3). Only one has eight, but it has two wrong answers marked as correct, one question related to another course, not this one. And one question even has meaningless answers (just letters A and B, not related to the question). So you have to guess to pass the test, using 3 tries every 8 hours. No graded final exam, so that the whole specialization becomes ""complete"" in the middle of the 3rd week, not after the 4th. Overall, the course looks hastily assembled without checks, but some videos have good introductory material in them.",0,1,M K,26649119
