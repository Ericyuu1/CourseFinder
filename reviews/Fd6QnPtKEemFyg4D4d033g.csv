I found the content quite useful to me as a PG chemical engineering student. However, the reason why I only give it 3-star is that its poor course organization. Compared to some other data science courses I took in Coursera, this course lacks TA to maintain it. Many quiz answers are simply wrong, and there is no guidance provided, which makes the practical part of this course extremely unfriendly. I believe in order to let our chemical engineer stay on track, much improvement is needed for the assessment part of this whole specialization. ",0,1,Ma Yunqiao,10462655
