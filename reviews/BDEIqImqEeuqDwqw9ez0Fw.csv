118853715~COURSE!~BDEIqImqEeuqDwqw9ez0Fw,1674172736677,4,0,"This course provided very thorough and general overviews of all financial aspects of life. I wish it had touched on more specific saving tactics rather than just listing them out. The quality of the videos was rather poor too. I personally like SoFi as a company and actually started banking with them prior to this course, so if you are looking to join a reliable and organized bank, they are it!",0,0,Larisa Simmons,118853715
