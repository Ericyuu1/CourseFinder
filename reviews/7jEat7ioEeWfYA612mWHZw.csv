931820~COURSE!~7jEat7ioEeWfYA612mWHZw,1496168162341,3,0,"I found this course extremely helpful, but I think it needs to be updated.  It might be useful to discuss a few key tools that are essential to SRs, one in particular the Equator Network for Systematic Reviews.  SRs should be registered with PROSPERO.  If you show a PROSPERO record, it will help reinforce some of the concepts you are teaching.  Some quiz questions are ambiguous.  I do not have my notes at the time of this writing so cannot point out the problem.  I think the problem was in Module 2. My most important concern is with the final assignment.  Having worked with so many groups on writing as well as evaluating SRs, ""those who analyzed the data"" would not need to be blinded to the treatment phase but the outcome phase.  It is my assumption that the sentence could have been written in a more meaningful way:  "" . . . were blinded to treatment and outcomes assessment.""  From a ""critical thinking"" standpoint, which is what I always try to get students to do because of the quality (or lack thereof) of writing, I thought this through carefully, and came up with a significantly different answer.  The course is geared so heavily to what is taught at Johns Hopkins.  This can be a bit wearying for some, though I appreciate the quality of your program.   The literature searching component could also use an update, but I did find much of the lecture very helpful--there are several webinars that will help the librarian (just as a refresher).  The examples that were used throughout the slides were exceptional and helped me to understand much of the material from a student's point of view.

The course is not perfect - some of the information presented is out of date, with the videos appearing to be at least five years old. Much of the course is underpinned by reviews which determined how to optimize systematic reviews, and it is likely that more is now known than when the videos were made. The age of the course also meant that the quoted sections of the Cochrane Handbook are several editions out of date, and the module on search strategies included screenshots of PubMed's old interface rather than the new 2020 interface.

Being the fellow from the related field of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, thought of sharing my views on some points. The last two lectures were comparatively too fast and some participants may not at all have prior exposure to the domain of epidemiology and biostatistics. Hence, the pace for these too needs to be adjusted for more comprehensive assessment. Secondly, the rubrics for the assignments, has scope for more structured presentation either in the form of tables or diagram. As such though they were very helpful, we needed to scroll down too much to find out the elaborate explanation for the same. Hence, a more structured format may be in excel, with vlookup functions for scoring system may be very handy at the back hand. This will facilitate the peer reviewer to have quick eye ball scrolling and in fact maximize the participation. Am looking forward for more such courses on Meta-Regression and Network-Meta Analysis in future.Thanks a lot to all the faculties who helped us in completing the course sucessfully.

The course content is well organized and logically sequenced, with clear instructions and use of examples. I especially like the balance in the way that systematic reviews seek to be information-led rather then method led and the inclusion of qualitative synthesis helps appreciate what is considered 'meaningful' nicely offsets any over reliance on statistical significance as the sole criterion regarding the importance of the research outcomes. However, the presentation of this part of the content was tentative and almost apologetic in emphasizing the importance of the qualitative synthesis, yet expressing a sense of uncertainty in how to do it. And sometimes the content got a bit skewed - for example it was stated that one has to be confident in one's judgements in order to make appropriate interpretations. When this kind of inductive process is applied as an assessment protocol  it is interpretations that informs judgements, not the other way around (ie in assuming a description - analysis - interpretation - judgment sequence) - after all, one's is being asked for an overall judgement of quality.",0,0,Graeme Sullivan,53460262
