The concepts introduced in the course is not too hard. But the execution of how to solve for a problem into actual code is oftentimes glossed over. If you do not know java already or some other kind of programming language, this course is not for you. Sometimes, the solution calls for you to use an obscure method/code that is not listed in the API list. The other problem is the homework. Most of the homework is worded convolutedly, vaguely (at times), and require the solution to be written in a way that is not taught until much later on in the class. Some information is scattered in the FAQ. Some of the information is not given at all. You have to hope that someone in the dashboards talks about it.

Having a master's from a competitive economics programme in mathematical finance I can easily say that this course was up there with respect to a proper challenge. I am happy to have problems which, like these, are not trivial nor immediately solvable.The autograding of the assignments is unbelievably well made. I learnt a lot from type checking to style checking, and although I don't yet feel fluent in Java, at least I now have a much deeper appreciation for compiled languages.

I am so lucky to have a chance to learn those great materials. For me,  the meaning of completing this course is way beyond the course itself.  I am a CS graduate more than 15 years ago, and I've done some computer engineering work for a while. Then I took a different path other than software engineer, because at some point my interest is on other things. What I did after software engineering are financial analysis, business analysis and data analysis. Nowadays, I am doing data analytics as my daily work. But as time passed by, I found programming is way fun than I thought before, and that's my real passion. So I decided to come back to software engineering field. But it's difficult, very very difficult, for companies accepting me as software engineer again. I don't know whether taking those CS courses and refreshing my knowledge will lead to the place where I want to be. But again, that's my interest and real passion. I just love programming.
