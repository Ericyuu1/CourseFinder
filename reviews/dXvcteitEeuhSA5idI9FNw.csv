119715236~COURSE!~dXvcteitEeuhSA5idI9FNw,1677295649700,3,0,"It's pretty alright as a gentle introduction to C++, made more fun by using the Unreal Engine as context. It felt a bit slow, though I guess that's because of the Unreal Engine stuff that needed to be taught between C++ features. And from what I gather, some of the practices encouraged are pretty suboptimal... I'd recommend this to absolute beginners to C++ OR Unreal, but not people looking to brush up on both.",0,0,Gabriel Cabrera,119715236

In addition, since the course is shown and explained in detail with the modern c++ structure, it does not create any difficulty in capturing the existing programming and adapting it to Unreal Engine. As someone who has completed the introductory course and this course, I can say that every Unreal Engine coding contains topics that everyone who wants to improve themselves should look at and know.",0,0,Barış Eroğlu,82623988
