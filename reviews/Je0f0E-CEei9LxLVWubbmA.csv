227561~COURSE!~Je0f0E-CEei9LxLVWubbmA,1671448660068,3,0,"The highlight of the course (and my main takeaway) is the theorem prover z3 from Microsoft.  Unfortunately, the Python API of this prover was not discussed.  I would have liked to see some examples explicitely coded.The discussion of the simplex algorithm is well done.I would have liked the details of constraint learning.  Unfortunately, this topic was only treated superficially.I found it really annoying that some parts of the slides were only visible for a few seconds before Prof. Zantema switched to the next slide.  This should really be fixed and is the reason I rated this course with only 3 stars instead of 4.",0,0,Karl Stroetmann,227561
