I enjoyed re-learning a few things that I had used previously.  However, I do encourage the professor to go over a few of the commands used here before actually incorporating them into the project.  Such as, ""grep, cut, xargs, find and awk"".  The man covers much about them but it would be helpful to see them being introduced before the project begins. Thanks",0,1,Leopoldo Hernandez,41188835
