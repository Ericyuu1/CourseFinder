18903623~COURSE!~naTKYx_OEe2BPRI-bktxDQ,1670766325497,1,0,"Another IBM course, another massive disappointment. IBM really, really needs to hire a trained and professional curriculum and instruction design expert. The instructional process goes: introduce concept -> explain concept -> ""play"" with concept -> assess understanding. And, don't assume knowledge of concept B if you're still just explaining concept A. The number of times this course assumes that you know how to do D, when they're just now explaining C and have already covered A and B is just too damn high. At this point, I will never take another IBM course again. They're unreliable. They're garbage. Even the content is ineffective. If you want a good course, take one from Google or Meta.

I can see it's value... the problem was the videos moved along  too quick and I wasn't able to digest the content. The other issue was the final project. None of the coursework or videos actually prepared me for the tasks required. I had to spend hours combing the internet to figure out ways to do each task.",0,0,Sarah White,110211876
