74529476~COURSE!~mPQDzw0IEeuh2QpCvqFzYQ,1605105437161,5,0,"This is a good guided project to introduce the basics of Git, how it happens and how to use it. Command line instructions are used initially and provides a solid foundation before switching to the more user-friendly tools/UIs.It is my first time using Rhyme, and it threw me off a bit because sometimes the focus is not on my desktop. Other than that, using a split screen is a novel experience and I can see how it can help with better learning as there is hands-on experience.Good practice and a concise instructor. All in all, highly recommended, no matter if you're a beginner or just back for a quick refresher.",0,0,Joanna Lim,74529476
