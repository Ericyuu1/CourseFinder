These complaints  have been voiced by students for over three years, in some cases inappropriately in anger/frustration.  A lot of time and frustration in meaningless work arounds could have been avoided if the instructors updated the course material when a bug was identified.  It is especially disappointing becuase the instructors have been informed of this issue by so many students for a few years. It might be that the instructors did report the issues but that they were ignored.I tried to contact the convenor, Antonio Cangiano, the so-called evangelist of the course, but there was no contact email- in my opinion, there should always be a means of escalating concerns to improve the quality of the course and the experience and knowledge in taking the course.  On at least four occasions in the discussion groups, I politely requested this matter to be escalated, but to no avail. Ignoring this request was especially galling because Mr Cangiano in his lectures emphasised that the user to be respected and be able to articulate its concerns.I woud respectfully recommend that IBM or the evangelist review the discussion logs of the students.P​S - I gave the course a rating of one star because I could not submit otherwise- I do not believe one star is warranted.",0,0,Michael Triguboff,5036280

I thought perhaps I was having issues on my end until I started going through all the messaging associated with the EXACT SAME ERRORS and it looks as if a number of people who attemted to get through it finally threw up their hands and walked away.  I would think these would be recent as just the last week IBM announced the depreciation of much of the capabilities used in the course - but the messages have gone back years.The result is that I had looked to the Watson platform as a solution in my industry - now I may start looking elsewhere.
