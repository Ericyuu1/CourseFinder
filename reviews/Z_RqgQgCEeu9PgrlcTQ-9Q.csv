69915545~COURSE!~Z_RqgQgCEeu9PgrlcTQ-9Q,1662968257667,4,0,I would like to give a 5 star rating to this course but the poor quality of many of the quizzes makes that impossible.I noticed the following problems:       (a) There are MANY typos in the quiz questions---these range from sentences which make no sense to misspelling. Routine editing is needed.          (b)In several quizzes questions are asked based on material covered in Later sections of the course.        (c) In one quiz the same question is asked twice.A​lso strange is that the instructors named for this course only give one or two of the lectures.,0,0,michael parmenter,69915545

However, the course contents are a bit vague and general, since the instructors mainly focus on concepts.It would be helpful if mentioning more cases. or focusing on fewer countries (instead of covering all Arctic regions)",0,0,Jimmy Chao,13972932
