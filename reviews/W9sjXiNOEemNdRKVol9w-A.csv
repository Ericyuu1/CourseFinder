3496492~COURSE!~W9sjXiNOEemNdRKVol9w-A,1609770491867,1,0,"Sadly, the worst course I've taken on Coursera, by a long shot.The quiz questions are badly-worded, with at least one answer in every quiz completely wrong. The assignments refer to concepts that aren't covered until later weeks. The final assignment doesn't even have a working link to the data! And the choice of Plotly/Python for the final assignment is ridiculous, ensuring that students (even those familiar with Python) spend more time struggling with syntax than applying any of the principles the course teaches. It would be better to have a 'tech-agnostic' assignment so students can use what they're comfortable with.The lectures themselves and course materials are good signposts to other resources, but that's about it. The lectures themselves are - I'm sorry to say but I have to be honest - difficult to follow without the use of subtitles.I regret paying for this course and it's made me think twice about the quality on this platform.",0,2,Sam Beardsworth,3496492
62435319~COURSE!~W9sjXiNOEemNdRKVol9w-A,1592736037621,1,0,The content is good however it is very difficult to follow the Professor whose English is heavily accented. There is nothing wrong with having an accent but in this particular case it gets in the way of the student's comprehension of the content. One is more focused on deciphering what is being said rather than the content itself. ,0,3,Maha Bashri,62435319
80158743~COURSE!~W9sjXiNOEemNdRKVol9w-A,1625281626393,2,0,"Please STEER CLEAR OF THIS COURSE. While the content of the videos is fascinating, they are completely unrelated to the coding assignments themselves. I spent weeks trying to teach myself how to complete the final assignment, and even then I do not think I understood exactly how to do it. Many of the coding examples given in the assignments are incorrect, so it can sometimes be impossible to even practice. It then took weeks for my final assignment to be graded. All in all, I wholly regret taking this course, and I advise you to not make the same mistake I did. ",0,0,Amina Naidjate,80158743
115108877~COURSE!~W9sjXiNOEemNdRKVol9w-A,1666670001106,3,0,"T​his course had a lot of great information and the instructor is extremely well-versed in the subject matter although a bit hard to understand when she's not on screen. The final assignment was extremely difficult to complete with the materials included and the level of instruction. It needs to be more thoughtfully laid out, pointing students toward additional resources and giving students access to the necessary files that are used to make the cloropleth map. Otherwise, I found it to be nearly impossible to create what was being requested as did many of my classmates, judging from the discussion forum and the assignment submissions.",0,0,Stephen Howie,115108877

I went through all the course materials and the videos in a few weeks during my winter break. These are great resources for a new beginner as I was able to get exposed to concepts of data visualization and acquire some practical and useful skills in working on dataset and creates the graphics that illustrates/summarizes the general patterns. I'd recommend this class to my peers. So far, it was one of my favorite paid courses in Coursera. ",0,1,Ryan Robert,121386587

The grading assignments are challenging but worth taking time to do so as it really help delveop a deeper understanding of the lecture materials. I was able to apply some of the skills into my real work on adveristing industries.  I enjoyed the classes as I learnt them in my leisure time at my own pace. I want to thank Professor Ng again for the helpful and pracitcal knowledge. I wouldnt have learnt these anywhere or from anyone else.,0,2,Gigi Gin,108525395

Her homework is scaffolding exercise that builds up your skills and confidence in using python to work on basic data visualization. I have been using R for a while but realized that python is a lot easier to plot graphs after paying to take this class.Her lectures are pretty straightforward and good as other have mentioned. She basically will tell you what you need to know for visualizing various types of data. It may just be me, I'd appreciate if more exercise could be provided because I really enjoy exploring different dataset and build up that skills towards data visualizing.  By far, this is one of the most interesting and useful course I paid to get certificates in Coursera so far. ",0,5,Jamie C,79542677

We thought visualizing data will be an important tread in every subject. Without any regret, we were having fun time learning online and learn lots of useful skills for presenting data in this course. However, we'd recommend Coursera to provide students with more technical support (e.g.,  printable notes access) so that we can keep every copy of the lecture or jot down some detail for future use.",0,7,Emily Eo,72962779

The class is very useful - especially data visualization is so important nowadays to convey findings and results to laypersons. I liked that the classes because they covered a wide range of topics which are all SO useful for my future presentations. The slides are so well-made and attractive for learning. They are great example for data visualization! Worth the time taking and strongly recommended for all disciplines who aims to present their findings in an attractive and simple yet understandable way.
