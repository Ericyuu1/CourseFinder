1366517~COURSE!~ypgDPuPQEeSyBSIAC9REKg,1448119303570,1,0,"While the content is very helpful and Gary does his best to make people confident to improvise in Jazz music, this course has imho two major flaws:The biggest one: assignments given and results accepted do not fit together. E.g. in week 1 learners are supposed to describe in their own words how a piece of music does sound like. But the accepted answers are totally different from such a description. Instead only a very detailed and specialized answer is accepted. This leads to studends copying these answers into their assignments without them learning anything. The other flaw is that Gary is very brief in his explanations. Even intermediate musicians seem to struggle with content just because some explanations are not exact or vague.

21502367~COURSE!~ypgDPuPQEeSyBSIAC9REKg,1487866788921,2,0,I did not like this course. It is a course for those who are already involved into the topic not newbies. Very general short and sloppy explanations and a lot of practical assignments for peer evaluation. I had a lot of experience in classical music but I was puzzled with what goes on in this course. After having completed some other jazz courses I realized that i had no chances to learn anything here since the theory is not explained sufficiently. The title of the course is misleading. It rather should be called a master class on jazz improvisation.  ,0,1,Alexander Popov,21502367
13334901~COURSE!~ypgDPuPQEeSyBSIAC9REKg,1453621965713,2,0,"The class covered a good variety of subjects to learn.  There are some key areas of improvement:1) You should build more examples in the lectures.  The lectures were short to start with, but adding more examples and passages would have helped.2) Xylophone is perhaps the worst instrument to use to teach this course, especially with the camera facing the front of the xylophone.  It was very hard to see what notes were being hit by the mallets (especially when using chords) and therefore it was very difficult to understand (visually) what Gary was doing.  I suggest using a keyboard and having the camera shooting from the above of the keyboard (look at how several people have done this on YouTube).  This way you can see what notes are being hit, held, and you can see them from a pianist's view.The material was good, but because of the two areas above the teaching was not as effective.",0,1,Michael Sanie,13334901

The criticism I would make is that the final marks seem to depend entirely on the skill level of those marking. I assume that the proportion of beginners to advanced players is quite large based on the fact that I generally received very high marks for work that I personally probably would have given a poorer mark to. I guess that is just a result of the peer marking system and I don't think that there is much that can be done about it. ,0,2,Joseph Cadman,20169048

For example, 1st assignment - descriptive analysis was asked to evaluate based on if the 3 ""most important"" things - if they have been mentioned in the description. The thing is that in real you can not tell, which are the most important because people think differently and could focus more on other details. It was easy to add also those ""important"" points by resubmitting work, but the problem is that only with that the analysis of a student is not getting better, thus the evaluation is not precise.  For tasks like that I would suggest at lease to make a list of 20 things to mention and then count how many are there - thus making the quality assessment more precise.2) Some topics could have been explained more detailed in the videos, e.g., about guide tones and lines 3) The requirements for the submissions could have been more clear. I also got the impression that in if switching the sessions the requirements could be slightly different (As I got the case when somebody pointed out a particular thing that he thought was required and I have not done. I checked the page but nothing about that. Also other classmates mentioned nothing about that and thought all was perfectly fine).I hope this helps.Thank you so much,Regards,Ance",0,0,Ance Laganovska,16650994
