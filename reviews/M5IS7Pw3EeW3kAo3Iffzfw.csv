3821560~COURSE!~M5IS7Pw3EeW3kAo3Iffzfw,1502735492122,4,0,"Good course. I did this course after the course ""Algorithms for DNA Sequencing"" of Ben Langmead. Since Ben Langmead was excellent in his explanations, my expectations were the same for this course but I felt that it is not as good as Ben Langmead course maybe because there are no practical videos about programming ideas.",0,1,Mohamed Akrout,3821560
3643966~COURSE!~M5IS7Pw3EeW3kAo3Iffzfw,1500301983151,4,0,Very interesting material. The only reason I marked this course as 4 stars instead of 5 stars is by comparison to the other courses in this specialization. This course does not have the online textbook which means that the student needs to work through the lecture videos very closely in order to be able to solve the programming assignments.,0,0,Thomas LaFleur,3643966
