This course is also very interesting to non-scientists and I am curious to see if the prosecutors understand the concepts of it.

37705982~COURSE!~6Ls0uS4PEei5Xwq_Ud-HLA,1548085144399,5,0,"This course is a great introduction into the
hierarchy of propositions and our duty to the court as expert witnesses.
It discusses in length the importance of reporting two alternate hypothesis in
a balanced and transparent manner.  It also drills home the risks
involved, and uses several real life case studies to demonstrate what happens when
science isn't followed or communicated correctly – that is, the associated dangers
of misrepresentation and misinterpretation of results by
both practitioner and judiciary. If you're skeptical and still
questioning the importance of improving current state reporting and testimony
(particularly within the pattern matching disciplines), then watch
the interviews of victims affected by high profile erroneous
fingerprint identifications (McKie/Mayfield). It not only humanizes what we do,
but reminds us that we have a duty to the court, to the science and to public
safety. It was a great privilege to be taught by leading forensic
practitioners! Their collective wealth of knowledge is evident and I admire the
large amount of behind-the-scenes work that would have been put into producing
this course. I highly recommend this to people interested in
strengthening forensic science, and I look forward to the next installment. ",0,3,Caroline ,37705982
