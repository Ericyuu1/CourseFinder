Initially, I thought the course would be full of learning about the functions of the brain but instead, there was a lot of neurology. Nonetheless, great course for understanding the fundamentals of the brain and this neurobiochem basis is what helps in understanding the bigger picture. Note/ advice: the only science I've done is AP physics and math. If you seek to understand the topics and make notes as you go along then there is no difficulty in completing the course!Neuroscience to me is like a puzzle: you have a lesion in the brain and you locate this by using the symptoms presented in the patient.

Beware, it's very heavy on anatomy, so pay lots of attention to the anatomy bits. You need to commit to really learning on this course - it's not easy and the multiple choice quizzes are challenging. Having done the course without an anatomy resource I can suggest that you get one (these are discussed in the course) as it would be very helpful in understanding the locations of everything that is talked about, which is really important. At times, Dr White is a little bit verbose and has a tendency to give a brief overview of something and then the overview morphs into a deeper view so it's repetitive but the structure isn't always clear. A textbook would be a helpful accompaniment to clear up some issues. Again, I didn't have this either, but Wikipedia was really helpful. Overall this is a great grounding in neuroscience and has the academic rigour you'd expect from a course offered by a university of the calibre of Duke. Don't be fooled by thinking this is easy because it's online, it's not! Be prepared to spend 6+ hours per week on this. ",0,1,Jerusha Richardson,41815609

It would be great to cut the length of lessons in half, by omitting all the unnecessary phrases and to accentuate the crucial points.

Dr. White does a phenomenal job of teaching complex concepts.  I appreciate his dedication to precision in language usage.  What an amazing opportunity to have access to his teaching.  I learned so much.  The course was truly challenging.  I didn't have the text or access to Sylvius but I took Dr. White's advice and created lots of drawings as I made my way through the tutorials.  It was also helpful to have a split screen running on my computer with the tutorial video on one side and the corresponding tutorial notes on the other.  I  took pages and pages of notes which proved helpful for the quizzes and final exam.  I did end up having to Google quit a bit - especially to find images of the neuroanatomy.

The course was very demanding, right from the start. I would say it was the hardest in the beginning, especially if you have no prior knowledge of the brain or medical terms. I believe that I learned a lot, but there is still so many things that I didn't get the grasp of, and that's fine. I am looking forward to taking this course again in the future. But the most important thing for me was that, with this course, I created a very healthy routine, where I would turn on the lectures after waking up, while having a cup of coffee. I can only see this routine continue further, maybe while watching some other lectures or reading. All in all it was a wholesome experience, I learned a lot, created new habits, got to know more about neuroscience with no prior experience. TEAM, THANK YOU.

The optional tools provided are also highly valuable, and the tips that are given all along are very useful when it comes to self-organization and techniques of study. The course is thick: there is much to say, and many times there is no space for everything, but it's a fine start if you do not know very much about Neuroscience. I particulary learnt a lot about anatomy, which is a big deal when understanding the Nervous System. The assessments are ""fun"": you don't just answer plain questions, but need to use all you've learnt, integrate it, and think to get to an answer. As a little flaw, I would say that in order to answer these questions, there are several things that are not thoroughly developped in the course and yet you must know about (the ""pathological"" part: diseases, circulatory system - which is quite complex and only approached switftly- etc.).

The course starts with a solid basis in neuroanatomy, and builds in concepts and topics in a well structured way.  The course seems to pursue two goals - on the one hand, to provide the basic neuroanatomy, physiology and functional background, and on the other to apply the knowledge to understand, identify and localize some medical conditions such as stroke, motor neuron disease, or Parkinson's Disease.  The lab sessions and tutorials are entertaining and informative, thanks to Dr. White's  friendly and engaging presentation style.   The tutorials are accompanied by useful notes, and the frequent quizzes support the learning of the very extensive material.  His recommendations for learning the material (follow the path, visualize your knowledge, learn spatially and socially) are useful in many other contexts.   The materials are supported by a reference texbook, Neuroscience 5th edition from 2012, and a new edition is expected in 2017.    Also, the text transcriptions of the video presentations appear to have been generated by machine, and need to be proofread and corrected.   In spite of this, they are very useful to review specific points in the videos.   Although the course presents a huge amount of material and the discussion forums allow both clarification of issues and questions as well as deepening and extending the knowledge provided by the basic materials in the course.  I strongly recommend this course to anyone interested in gaining a basic overview of human neuroscience.     ",0,0,Esteban Pombo,22048673

The teacher is committed, patient, kind and overall excellent.This is a very good course but i personally feel that the lectures should be spread over at least 20 weeks instead of 13. As it is currently taught, the course is placing a lot of stress and pressure on the student to keep up with the pace if the student also has other home or work commitments so it makes it difficult for such an interested student to go into all the depths the course asks for if time is  constrained by the pace of the course. I feel that if the course had been taught over 20 weeks at least then i would have had more time each week to go into it in more details.But overall i really enjoyed the lectures, and i know i have learnt all that i will ever want to know about the neurology of the human bodyThank you Dr White and team for all your time and efforts in putting out such a wonderful course.

The tutorial notes give a great start for your own knowledge structuring.This course is no light thing. My impression from some of other MOOC sites is that they are much superficial.

12470470~COURSE!~Nyq7nXzPEeWb-BLhFdaGww,1465271821935,5,0,"If you are looking to learn from a gifted professor, if you want to walk away with a lot of knowledge, if you need a new way of looking at neuroscience, or if you want to be hooked on the subject, look no further. The large international community of learners is really friendly and motivated, too, so as a bonus, you may find new friendships. Dr. White (Len) needs to be a name as familiar to neuroscience as Dr. Goljan to pathology or Dr. Fischer to internal medicine, and you will see why when things just click in your head and when you finish with more understanding than from other courses; he is just such a great teacher. A glimpse of his brilliance as an instructor is when a learner walks away successfully with the knowledge of a medical student and can apply that to research or a clinical situation. The examples that Professor White lectures stuck in my head; the pictures he selects or the ones he draws are easy to recall. Neuroscience is a visual subject as much as it is knowledge-based, and this course stresses and utilizes both. Professor’s White unique talents are 1) to seamlessly repeat an important concept always in a fresh way and 2) to predict the learners’ struggles and confusions and address them. It is no wonder that students at his school honored Len with prestigious teaching awards. You can easily see Dr. White’s excitement for neuroscience and his passion for teaching. Simply a blessing that most of the world is free to learn from him. Two other rare features stand out about this course: heavily involved teaching assistants, such as Ellen (look at the site she put together learnmedicalneuroscience.nl/), and detailed unit notes.  In summary, while this is the most demanding and lengthy course on Coursera (I felt the speed of the course was just right), it is also the most rewarding. Duke University has continuously proved to be a great school to take class via Coursera.",0,10,Marina Buryak,12470470
