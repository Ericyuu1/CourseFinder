A lot of generic information that could be gleaned from a book at a fraction of the cost. You are paying for the credential, but I wonder how valuable it actual is.",0,0,Dustin Wilson,67373312

I don't mind multiple-choice tests because I can do them and move on, but the peer-graded assignments are infuriating. Waiting to complete courses because no one is grading assignments half the time, even though I grade theirs, gets old quickly. It's what makes me consider canceling my subscription entirely.",0,2,MG,67704657

I had to rush at the end because I didn't realize week 2 was for finding sources, week 3 was for contacting them, week 4 was for interviews, etc...
