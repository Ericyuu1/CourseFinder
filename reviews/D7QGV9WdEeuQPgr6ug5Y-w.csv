It is available within similar GCP and IBM trainings.2​. Ambigious and wrong questions. Same question in the preparation quiz has different answers in the completion test.3​. The content differs from the official Microsoft Learn trainings.",0,0,Günes Sen,5375670

Labs would benefit from data being given to the student so they can follow along, rather than being reading comprehension exercises.
