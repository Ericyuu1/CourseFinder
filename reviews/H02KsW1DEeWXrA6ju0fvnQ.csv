Or does it require doing folds and then breaking each of those up into training and testing chunks.  Or why is it not okay to use a model training function that internally does cross validation similar like randomForest documentation suggests.   Also things like what the prediction accuracy implies in contrast to the model oob [ in ] sample error estimate and if that estimate is akin to the 1 - prediction accuracy on test data set, i.e. out of sample error estimate.

Also, of the three instructors, I am most favorable to Jeff Leek, who teaches this class. He communicates much clearer than Roger Peng or Brian Caffo. I find I learn more from his content than the others.

Lastly, I will say that this class doesn't hold a torch to University of Washington's Machine Learning specialization. That's expected since this is one class and that's a whole series of classes.

1308282~COURSE!~H02KsW1DEeWXrA6ju0fvnQ,1450505132999,4,0,"Thank
you for inviting me to be a beta tester for Practical Machine
Learning. I completed this course at the beginning of October of this
year. When I was asked to be a ""beta tester"" I thought that
I would be presented with new materials. However, the only thing that
has changed is the look and layout of the Coursera web pages. The
video lectures, quizzes, and assignment are the same as they have
been for quite some time. Here are some specific comments:1.
The video lectures: To me, these are clear and easy to follow.
However, like those in the other courses in the Data Science
Specialization, this course covers a wide range of subjects but tends
not to have much depth. When I compare this and other courses in the
specialization to other moocs that I have taken including Machine
Learning with Andrew Ng and the Stanford Online EdX Course
Statistical Learning with Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani, the
somewhat cursory treatment of the topics in the Data Science
Specialization becomes more noticeable. Perhaps in the interest of
""truth in advertising"" this course should be called ""A
Brief Introduction to Practical Machine Learning."" In the
interest of full disclosure, I should note that I have an
undergraduate degree in economics and an MS and PhD in psychology
with a quantitative bent. I have had lots of statistics courses,
especially those related to ANOVA, MANOVA, nonparametric statistics, correlation and regression
methods, and structural equation modeling. The latter is important in
psychology because researchers in this field like to measure latent
variables. I had been an analyst using SPSS for several decades and
the courses in this specialization helped me to migrate to R. Also,
there have been may new developments that have become more accessible
through R packages (like the fancier tree methods) that were not
available when I completed my PhD. Thus these courses (and others
such as the ones by Ng  and Hastie and Tibshirani) have helped me to
keep abreast of these developments. So they are good for me, but I
wonder to what degree do the courses in the Data Science
Specialization actually make a person a ""data scientist?""2.
The quizzes: I think these items are good practice and are at a
reasonable level of difficulty. However, these items are the same
ones that you have been giving for quite some time, with perhaps a
few new ones added. A little googling will lead you to the answers to
these quizzes posted online. I recommend that you put a little time
and effort into writing all new items.  
3.
The final project: Again, this project is good practice and seems to
be at a reasonable level of difficulty. And again, this is the same
project that appears to have been given at the end of numerous
iterations of this course. And again, numerous write-ups for this
project can be found online. And again, I would recommend that you
put a little time and effort into finding a new data set for people
to analyze. This would help minimize some of the rampant cheating
that I found in this and in other classes in the specialization.On
the subject of cheating,  when I was doing the peer grading for the
courses in the Specialization, I would enter the code of the students
that I was grading into the Google search box and all too often I
found links to submissions for the project by students who had taken
earlier sessions of the class. That is, students were copying these
earlier submissions by other students and submitting them as their
own. And I don't mean that they were similar: students were copying
other people's work line by line, character by character. I found
that to be quite irritating and I always reported it to Coursera. Of
course, if the instructors would change their assignments once I a
while, then this sort of copying would be impossible. As it is, it
appears that the good professors put a lot of time and effort into
creating what are indeed a worthwhile set of classes. However, after
they created the classes, they seem to have pushed the ""autopilot""
button and gone off to do their day jobs. I would suggest that
re-engaging with these courses and reading some of the comments that
other students have made would be helpful. 
Overall,
I appreciate the courses in the Data Science Specialization and
specifically this course. I know that these class materials took
considerable time and efforts to create. I wish the instructors
continued success with these classes.",0,0,Rudolf Neuhaus,1308282

But because of the strong interest in ML, I am going to attempt a detailed review.PROS: This course truly de-mystifies ""Machine Learning"". After completing the course, you will be able to programmatically use 100s of ML algorithms that have been created by others over the years. You will be able to use the Caret package in R to simplify your application, simplify pre-processing, perform automatic cross-validation/model tuning and generate various statistics about the model used by your ML algorithm. You will be able to easily estimate out-of-sample accuracy to determine if your model has any hope of working well, picking one classifier over the other, or using several classifiers to estimate outcome. You will learn how some of the heavily used algorithms in the industry work behind the scenes, and where to go to learn more about these. Several learning databases are introduced. If you tinker with them, you will be amazed at how easy R and Caret make it to apply ML algorithms. You will understand how chatbots, recommender systems, spam filters, ""prediction"" systems and the like work.WHAT THIS COURSE DOES NOT COVER:It does not cover how to write your own ML algorithms. That requires working knowledge of optimization algorithms, advanced math and probably lots of other resources. WHO SHOULD TAKE THIS COURSE?Only those prepared to work hard, dig in, and persevere through a lot of (sometimes difficult) material will benefit from this course. If you're not confident about your statistics concepts, not comfortable with R and databases, not comfortable with googling for parameters and techniques not directly discussed in class slides, then you will have trouble. Passing the quizes require you to refer to material from prior weeks, read online documents and look for similar solutions at stackexchange etc. TIP FOR MENTORS:For every week of the course, create a pinned post which says ""Tips/Errata for Quiz #n"". You've collected sufficient feedback from students now and know what the common issues are. Don't make them search through 100s of discussions to figure out solutions to well-known/common problems.",0,10,Yatin Majmudar,21774970
