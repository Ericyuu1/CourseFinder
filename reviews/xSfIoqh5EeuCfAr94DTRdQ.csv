95450075~COURSE!~xSfIoqh5EeuCfAr94DTRdQ,1634497832878,2,0,I was not impressed with this course. It was incredibly basic. I wanted to learn more about how to think about using NPS. This class did not cover that. Too much time was spent in Miro. There was nothing really special shown about Miro and NPS. It just used Miro as a visualization tool.,0,0,Rebecca Grossman,95450075
