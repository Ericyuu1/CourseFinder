114281404~COURSE!~MQgi2_yWEeeAGBJhiIK7tA,1674508858237,4,0,"A nice ""treat"" after all the abstract theory.  Found the image processing material more interesting than I expected.  Wished the real-time audio processing had gotten a more thorough treatment.   My biggest gripe (which was true for the rest of the courses in the specialization) is that the quizzes often relied on inferences or assumptions that were either not covered in the lectures or not clarified in the questions.  This wouldn't be an issue if it was easy to get help and clarification, but it's not.",0,0,Evan Yandell,114281404

You will learn a lot of signal procesing from this course.. P​.S.- If anyone can attach a few Image processing referance books and pdfs, it will be easier to follow the lectures.",0,0,atri pal 2029,77566920
