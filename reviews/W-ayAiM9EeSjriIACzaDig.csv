4071360~COURSE!~W-ayAiM9EeSjriIACzaDig,1512845379085,4,0,"I think Professor Adelstein is good, measured and clear. I mostly read the transcripts of the lectures to save time, but occasionally watched the videos and found them pretty digestible. Even the transcripts are good -- he uses fairly clear examples, and mostly stayed away from converting the legal ideas into formulae, which are extremely confusing to me and I think unnecessarily complicated. So, he didn't do that, which was nice.Also, the Professor Adelstein covered the history and development of property itself, in addition to the law, and the structures of the economic and judicial systems that prevail today. I find this stuff really interesting, and I appreciate it. What can feel like jargon in the abstract is way easier to understand in context -- ""Oh, this exists because this guy said some of his ideas and Oliver Wendell Holmes agreed and now it's part of the common law."" Humanizes the whole thing.A final note: a few times I caught the professor saying things like, ""In the U.S., 'playing hardball' is an expression for when negotiations get forceful"", and I'd think, ""Why is he phrasing this as 'In the U.S., he teaches at Wesleyan, we all know what playing hardball is.'"" And then I realized that this is Coursera, there's probably a bunch of international learners who might speak English but don't know the idioms and I thought, damn, what a good professor, to be cognizant of that. It would probably be a minor misunderstanding if he didn't explain it, but that he did indicates to me that he's a decent man, and I appreciate that. So that's my review. Good course, way less boring than the title makes it sound like it will be.",0,0,,4071360

The contents match the course description exactly. The suggested readings are articles written by legal scholars, so they may seem a bit intimidating, but the videos explain the concepts in a lucid manner.
