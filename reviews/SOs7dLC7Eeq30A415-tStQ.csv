What I like most about this specialization is the accessibility of the lecturer. If you post a question in one of the forums, chances are high that the lecturer or someone else takes the time and tries to answer your question within a couple of hours. Great commitment - thank you for that!",0,0,Ben Bonset,33708195

14743571~COURSE!~SOs7dLC7Eeq30A415-tStQ,1617880848503,5,0,This is the second course I have taken with this Dr. Paschall. I think he provides a challenging yet supportive and satisfying learning experience.  Dr. Paschall chooses interesting real world data and creates interesting assignments and assessments. His videos are filled with important content and instruction. The reading materials are solid texts. Dr. Paschall provides helpful hints and is incredibly responsive in the forums. I have completed 20+ courses on Coursera and I am a Coursera beta tester and I think Dr. Paschall's courses are among the best on the platform.  ,0,2,Regis O'Connor,14743571
