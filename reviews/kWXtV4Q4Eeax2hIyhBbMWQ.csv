We students have learned the rest of the specialization's tenses: subjunctive, future and conditional. The lessons are logically structured, and the interactive exercises, quizzes and peer review assignments including video/audio recording consolidate the acquired knowledge.Profesor Blake es muy motivador.

47513518~COURSE!~kWXtV4Q4Eeax2hIyhBbMWQ,1596297859190,5,0,"I just completed 4 courses of this specialization. Being almost brand new to the Spanish language, these courses were a great way to ""dive deep"" and be exposed to most commonly used vocabulary and many of the most commonly used verbs and verb tenses.  You will not be ""spoon fed"" and will definitely need to look toward other sources for more instruction on concepts which are difficult to understand (I found some of the explanations way to brief for me), but there is so much material online now, you can easily look on Youtube to get further information (for instance, on the different verb tenses and when they are used). Learning a foreign language is a marathon, not a sprint, so this is only the beginning for me, but was a great set of courses and I learned so much! I would recommend it to anyone who is ready to work hard and enjoy the process of language learning!",0,1,Sarah M Risley,47513518
