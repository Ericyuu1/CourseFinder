Prof. Kleiner is very interesting and a real pedagogue.But I have a few criticisms on the MOOC aspect:- It is much too concentrated! Some weeks have more than 3 hours of video, which is much longer than any other courses I have taken on Coursera.- The assignments with their strict 250-words limit, although interesting, are difficult for one whose mother tongue is not English. The 3rd one (the ideal Roman city) is especially long to do and the peer reviews are sometimes strange...- The ""monuments list"", often mentioned in the course, is not available in the MOOC- It would be better to have real rated quizzes at the end of a week rather than small ones in the middle of a video, or worse, at the end of it which is often cut by the advertising for the certificate before it is possible to answer it!",0,5,Marie-Pierre Bodez,26737792

21575945~COURSE!~mShQi8YfEeWg0QoHq3JjoQ,1501687789538,5,0,"  Very good course, with informative lectures and nice images.  Do recommend that you purchase the companion digital book by Prof. Kleiner and the often cited book ""Roman Architecture"" by John Ward-Perkins.    My criticisms are few: 1.  The peer grading on assignments is flawed.  One fellow ""learned"" lifted an entire paragraph from my essay, and by happenstance I was a grader on his essay, so I reported this episode of plagiarism.  And as galling as that was, he also gave me my lowest grade on that assignment.2.  Some of the objective answer questions on quizzes contain a word or two that really alters the appropriate answer.  E.G.  One asks something  like ""All Roman amphitheaters were ...""  when in reality the actual answer would be ""Most Roman amphitheaters were...""  If there is at least one in the first category, then you can't say ""all.""3.  Enough with the Yalie stuff.  Bulldog, bulldog, bow wow wow!  Seriously.  E.G.""Any of you Yalies going to Italy for spring break should be sure to visit...""  4.  No offense, Prof. Kleiner, but if I want restaurant or gelateria recommendations for Italy, I'll do some serious Internet searches.  Tre Scalini is a famous tourist destination, and few would contend that it has ""the best gelato in Rome.""5.  Consider adding the oft referenced ""Monuments List"" as an appendix for those who are taking the course online.  That said, easily one of the best courses on Coursera and far superior to another offered by an archaeology professor and his dog.",0,8,Jan Kubik,21575945
