Perhaps in the future there could be included more quizzes and more visual charts. More examples of bad analytics vs. good analytics.It might be just myself, but I did not enjoy this course as compared to the other three courses. I think that compared to Professor Leigh Thompson, Course #1, there was a lot of ambiguity in the material, the analyzing of data, in my opinion only, as I believed the RED data to be on target and it was not as such.I truly felt that the experiment conducted with RED was on target, it had a control group, it fit the definitions and produced the results adequately, but I was wrong.I felt that the course did not fill the ""clarity, clear & concise answers"" to the questions assigned, but then again, I am wrong in my assumptions as those I graded got the correct answers.Thank You anyway, for giving me the opportunity to take this course.

2568474~COURSE!~VlLC102NEeWEHRLwpfV5DQ,1453159031435,3,0,"What I liked - objective style of presentation, professional approach to the topics.What I didn't liked - no slides for the lectures, all modules should had quizzes, excessivelly short content per module. The average videos were about 30-40 minutes per module. That is not nearly enough. As an example, specializations from Wharton (Business Foundations and Business Analytics), Michigan (Leading People and Finance) and Illinois (improving Business Finances and Operations and Digital Marketing) are offering 1-5 to 3 hours of video content per module... Plus resources - slides, excel spreadsheets and readings). Northwestern in this specialization and also on the Social Media Marketing as also in the course Scaling Operations is only offering about 30-40 minutes of material per module. In this competitive landscape for my experience, it is very short. In this course I can only - at best, give it a 3/5.I hope you take my critique positevly and try and present more solid offers in the future. In my opinion edigital education is the future and content is king - both in quality and quantity.Nonetheless is positive to see a top university having this kind of offerings in Coursera.",0,0,Ricardo Oliveira,2568474
