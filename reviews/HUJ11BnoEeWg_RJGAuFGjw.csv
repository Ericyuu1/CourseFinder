78018673~COURSE!~HUJ11BnoEeWg_RJGAuFGjw,1618885098877,4,0,This is a very important subject & should be widely taught & brought into the education system so that we can learn this in school already & be set for life.  It is well taught but the way it is presented here is only on a weekend seminar level & not a university class.   This class needs to get up-graded adding assignements per week from easy to challanging situations so that one gets to practice since this subject needs practice so that one remembers what to do when under pressure & for the long-term.  It needs reflective journaling entries that other students can read and give feed-back on.  I don't want to be told go & get help from a coach after taking a university class.   I expect that I can apply this rather well after taking a university class.  Also the test questions should have the correct answers after the marking so that one can understand what is meant in this context since some of it could be also seen differently.  Coursera has all of that set up for instructors to make use of.  Please work this course over making use of all of these features.  The e-mail that was sent out by the instructor after finishing this course has only 6 of the 7 skills listed.  Skill 5 is missing.  As a real university class it needs some literature references of this subject and of the mentioned research.  I am sure that this senior instructor is fully capable of improving this class to a real university class.  ,0,0,Karen Stock,78018673

However, I have the following improvement suggestions: 1. The lecture delivery could be better, lacked personal touch as clearly it was read from another sceen... 2. The quizzes should be designed in a more intellectually challenging manner more focusing on understanding of concepts... 3. If the answer is incorrect, the feedback should mention why the answer is incorrect and also hint what the right answer can be, as a point to think for the trainee... 4. The final test consisted of 35+ questions (so far I remember), which means failing this test would require a trainee to repeat the whole questionnaire as well... also, without the proper answer hints, it will be too difficult for him/her to understand what was wrong in his answer.
