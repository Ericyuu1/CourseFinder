75759601~COURSE!~dVypMRNFEeu26BKzAkmpSw,1643115118265,1,0,Poor content on this course as well. A bit of intermediate machine learning concepts that we all have seen a thousand times and a bit of mlops. The instructor was always always reading only whats in the slide. Graded assignments on GCP were just copy/pasting the code and had no difficulty or needed any critical thinking or skills. Again focused ONLY on Tensorflow libraries that are incompatible with models from other libraries like Pytorch.,0,13,Panagiotis Souranis,75759601

In most cases, slides were containing text only and were more distracting than helpful. Many important concepts were insufficiently explained with only one or two sentences. Graded labs were ok, but most of the ungraded labs were more lectures than labs (no code was written - only thing you had to do is run cells in colab)In addition, it feels like the course focuses only on google environment rather than in general ML concepts.",0,1,Karol Jedrzejewski,32638039

It is certainly not because the topics are not up to date or anything but it is the way it is presented. The slides are cluttered with buzzwords and nonsense and the actual content is only spoken. This makes the slides completely useless. From the labs, i learned pretty much nothing and will have to do another course about the same thing somewhere else. ",0,0,Simon Buse,98092413
98117275~COURSE!~dVypMRNFEeu26BKzAkmpSw,1660519854624,2,0,"Except for the huge amount of Google TFX sales talk, the biggest disappointment is that the instructor just reads the slides plainly without going over the key concepts in depth. Some of the concepts like PCA, they should be explained much more clearly, but what he does is just showing a rotating image and throwing out a few quizes. I mean, what's the point? I get far more knowledge from an Youtube video than mostly any of the concept explaination here. I have to double my time learning them, because there are rarely any good, down-to-earth explanations. Everything here is super fast, plain reading, and ""Google stuff is the best"".",0,4,Phillip Gu,98117275

He barely explains any concepts, gives examples to help develop understanding. Some concept is unclear and poorly explained. Every single lecture, he just reads from scripts. It's very frustrating to learn. Coursera, in my view, is strong in delivery content that's more technical, more engaging, better explained technical concepts. But this course fails to deliver that. Watching many videos on Youtube is better than learning from this instructor. It is just terrible delivery, and I wish it was Andrew Ng who taught it. The only good part is the labs. Labs are well prepared and help with the study.",0,5,Nithiwat Siripatrachai,34894524

However, I'm very dissapointed with this one, for several reasons.First, the instructur is not nearly as engaging as Andrew Ng himself. Most of the time he basically reads through the slides in a monotous way.Second, the course tries to cover too many concepts. Instead of selecting a few core topics and explaining them in detail, the course seems like an ennumeration of ML concepts. Most of the times, the explanations are way to shallow to be of practical use.Third, the exercises are quite poor. Most of them are just plain Google Cloud tutorials on Quicklabs.",0,7,Arturo Miquel,22970217

On the one hand, the theory that is taught is quite general and trivial, while on the other hand, the technical focus is mostly on Google's tools and deep learning. As getting machine learning to production is an advanced task and requires a broad set of skills, I would've, for instance, expected this course to be more on structured data.
Also, most of the labs, especially the GCP ones, feel just like copying and pasting some commands, it's not that challenging and therefore I didn't learn a lot there.",0,14,Folkert Stijnman,14307135
11748129~COURSE!~dVypMRNFEeu26BKzAkmpSw,1668957475258,4,0,What's Good- The selection of the topics for the programming assignments is outstanding - I am very experienced at completing QwikLab assignments with ML Pipelines and I still learned something new.- The topic coverage is great - I learned a lot of things in the field that I was not aware of.What can be improved- The lectures are being read from notes and it's hard to listen to without increasing the playback speed to 2x. I think there should be more readings and the videos should be more engaging (i.e. like the GAN specialization's lectures).- The quizzes should count as part of the grade. It's possible to complete the all QwikLab assignments within a couple hours and the entirely of the course completion credit is based on that.,0,0,Vijay,11748129
