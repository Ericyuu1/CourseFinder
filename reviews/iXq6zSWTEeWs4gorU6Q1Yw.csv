13404718~COURSE!~iXq6zSWTEeWs4gorU6Q1Yw,1452677613876,2,0,"TL;DR -- Good videos but short and not always relevant material; the course should be titled ""A First Light Introduction to Strategy Implementation"" The ""Strategy Implementation"" course is rather a first introduction to the concepts. The material is quite short: only 30 minutes of videos every week and no interviews with ""real-life"" managers.The additional articles to read most relate to blue-chip companies that succeeded: Samsung, Toyota, Netflix, Google, and of course the obligatory Apple mentioned in every Strategy course on the planet. However, it would be much more interesting to discuss failures and/or duller companies.Finally, the final peer-review exercise is a bit broken but that is the case of every MOOC peer-graded approach (cf. https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/hack-higher-education/problems-peer-grading-coursera to know more).

For me it was quite clear that the goal was to pick the strategic option for Etypes to choose the ""team danmark logo"" which in essence also defines the bigger strategy of eTypes to stay edgy and a rebel designer company. We were supposed to pick implementation plans specifically for this strategy. However, some of the peers assumed that they could propose several strategies, and combine a series of implementation plans, and put them altogether into this assignment. This in my opinion, lead to some confusion in some of the peers assignment submissions and their reviews for the assignment. ",0,1,Karthik Arumugam,4055474
