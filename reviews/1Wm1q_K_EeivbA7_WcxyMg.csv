17719168~COURSE!~1Wm1q_K_EeivbA7_WcxyMg,1668151694695,4,0,"Tsinghua algorithm courses covers the more advanced data structures in a very lucid manner, enhancing better understanding and appreciation for things being done in a particular manner. Appreciate the course a lot, as it helps me gain a better understanding of more advanced data structures not found elsewhere.The questions are not easy either, especially the programming questions. This is excaberbated by not being able to use existing adts provided as is from c++, but we need to code our own vectors , and so on. However after we have succeeded in completing the course, the skill level would definitely soar.Highly recommended for those wanting to up their skillsets,and have a greater understanding!",0,0,Heng Joon Tiang,17719168
