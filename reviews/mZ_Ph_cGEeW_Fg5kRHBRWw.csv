7447680~COURSE!~mZ_Ph_cGEeW_Fg5kRHBRWw,1475364904373,3,0,"The course was very informative in the areas it covered, Unfortunately it almost totally ignored the Israeli Arabs who make up about 20% of the population; perhaps it is normal to exclude them in Israel, but this is supposed to be an international course. With regard to the 'peace process', we were informed that one of the major problems with 'peace negotiations' between Israel and the Palestinians was the 1948 issue, yet Rabin was clearly murdered because it was thought he would return land occupied in 1967 - so your analysis doesn't quite add up. As right wing and religious extremism in Israel and amongst the settlers has clearly worsened since Rabin's death it would have been  appropriate to explained how it is now possible with a two state solution, and how todays level of extremism is likely to affect Israel itself.

However, internal fragmentation and weak leadership limits Israel's potential to improving the quality of lives of its citizens. There is vigorous debate about the inherent contradiction between a Jewish State and Democracy. I am sympathetic towards the position of the Left, that Israel moves towards a fully democratic state, granting equal right to its citizen regardless of ethnicity. It would be a bold move, a departure from what has been attempted in the past 2000 years of Jewish history. When  the occupied Palestinians, Arab minority, Orthodox Jews and other underprivileged segments of Israeli society can also share the prosperity ushered in by economic and military achievement of modern Israel,  the future of Israel will be secure and also an inspiration for other countries near and far.",0,0,hunglun o,67818994
