There is no logical development of the course content - it's all disconnected facts told one after another.Another factor is the delivery. I know the teachers are Italians & English is not their first language and that is fine. But they are just reading out the content - that's all. They are just passively reading the content from somewhere so it is hard to concentrate because the interactivity value is zero and their accent takes some time to get used to.Both content and delivery of this course were disappointing even though I was (and am) really, really interested in this topic.",0,0,Reema Singhal,1981863
