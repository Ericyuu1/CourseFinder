The content is good he differently know's the material, but delivery is lacking. I expect more from professors at U of I (use U Penn's Corp. Finance class as a great example).  The use of ""right"" and ""okay"" when presenting makes it hard to follow the materiel. - Suggestion for professor, please work on reducing ""right"" from each sentence. Doing a search for of all 8 modules transcripts ""right?"" is said 2212 times, and I noticed many of the transcripts do not include all the ""rights"" that are used. ""Okay?"" was used 1611 times.

The  course doesn't follow the order of the book, jumps around quite a lot,  still lines up quite well.- The honors assigmnents are worth the time, make you think in a more organic way than quizzes that tend to be more mechanical.-  Even though it's not mentioned in the requirements, it's definitely  useful to take the Investments course first.
