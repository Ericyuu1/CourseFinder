12393598~COURSE!~w8XFGTVyEeWW9BKhJ4xW0Q,1473649885821,2,0,"Professor Dinham's investigative and research based approach is great, and in my opinion much needed in the professional educational community worldwidely. The material is presented thoroughly and the second piece of peer-assesed assignment is pretty well explained.However, I think the course material proposed in the outlines should be more diverse, by adding complementary video lectures, research articles and book extracts in every week, since this was proposed in this way just in fifth week; course 5 of the specialization program is a great example of that.The first piece of peer-assessed assignment may improve by being clearer and giving the opportunity to the learner to express his/her own ideas, instead of request a summary from this. Multiple Choice Questions should follow the principles exposed in the 6th course of the specialization program, which seems to not be done at all. Forums prompts should be shorter and clearer by highlighting a single key question instead of a bunch of these as happened.",0,0,Jhonatan Javier Ardila Escorcia,12393598

Now taking my certificate that I will put in my CV depends on reviewing my work, now I cannot apply for the job only after If I get the certificate of this course and this thing hurt me a lot.Why have I been late getting the certificate because there are no people registered with me for this course at the same time? Or that no one has evaluated my work?Please find a solution to this problem and keep this in mind.",0,0,Fatma Mohamed Zahran,46577081
