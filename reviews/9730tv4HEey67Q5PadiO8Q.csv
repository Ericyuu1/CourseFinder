60421895~COURSE!~9730tv4HEey67Q5PadiO8Q,1675715129140,5,0,"I thought this was very interesting!   Three things stand out:  1) hints of how to counter racism (super helpful!), 2) the personal stories and perspectives of the people who were interviewed, and 3) that there is a lack of historical/cultural info available even if you search it out.Disclaimer: I audited this course, and watch videos while exercising, so didn't do the reading.Included was a link to a youtube about Vietnamese immigrantion that was fascinating, and when I searched for history of Vietnam in English on youtube, I couldn't really find anything.(I found the same situation on the history of Eastern European countries, etc also, but it's unfortunate as videos can be an excellent way to learn..)",0,0,Kathy Conner,60421895
