In reality, organ meats and egg yolks are higher in micronutrients than many fruits and vegetables, and only small amounts of dark-colored veggies and fruits are required to balance a diet that already contains a variety of meats (as far as both species and cut). The body is also better able to synthesize glucose (or utilize ketones instead of glucose to fuel cell function) than to synthesize amino acids, which are more easily obtained in the correct amounts from animal sources.

This is certainly a message that many people need to hear.Unfortunately, the advice concerning what to eat is less sound.  Let me illustrate this with a historical counterexample.Around 75 years ago, a Canadian dentist visited my home country of Switzerland, where he examined the health and diet of a population in a secluded mountain valley.  He found them to be of exceptional health.  Their diet?breakfast: rye sourdough bread, butter and cheeselunch: rye sourdough bread, butter and cheesedinner: rye sourdough bread, butter, cheese and potatoes, along with some vegetables in the warmer half of the year, and small amounts of meat on SundaysContrary to four fundamental recommendations in the course, these people ate a lot of saturated fat (butter) and animal protein (cheese), but few vegetables and had hardly any variation in their diet.They did prepare their own food, grown or pastured locally, in very mineral-rich soil, which imparted their butter and cheese with very high amounts of fat-soluble vitamins A, D and K2.  Perhaps animal foods are not as unhealthy as the course suggests, and food (and soil) quality is paramount.Instead of taking this course, watch Maya Adam's TEDx talk (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-gyIkA-crM) and browse the recommendations of the Weston A. Price Foundation (http://www.westonaprice.org/) to learn what to cook, in particular their Healthy4Life dietary guidelines (http://www.westonaprice.org/wp-content/uploads/Healthy4LifeEnglish.pdf).

In my house, we do eat moderately for pleasure and cook from scratch at every meal (some meals take 15min to make!) . I personnally cook meat or fish or egg once, sometimes twice a week for my family and rarely buy cured meat. I cook mainly plant based meals with the goal of eating tasty food that we all enjoy or experience. I wasn't aware that I was doing the right thing which is nice to discover. Here, most people talk about ""healthy food""; I grew up in a culture we simply talk about food and what to cook, nopt wether if it's healthy or not, but our food is looking like ""food"" in its original form. Despite this course being quite basic, I enjoyed it as it is always good to be reminded; it  also gave me a good idea at why the United-States were in an obesity crisis: I didn't expect their supermarket to sell as much convenient and processed food. I hope that the food industry will change in the future so people can become as healthy, mobile, pain free and happy as they deserve to be, without giant corporations making millions selling processed food.

I love the videos, the structure of the course, and how Maya Adam explained everything so clearly and concise. I also really appreciate those interviews with Michael Pollan and I agree with what he said: ""eat food, not too much, mostly plants"". This course has taught me a lot in a very short amount of time. I also love how the course includes a list of recipes in week 5, these are amazing. I love cooking and I love living a healthy lifestyle. I'm absolutely going to try some of the recipes!I think it will be better to include more examples or data from other parts of the world instead of just the U.S.. I am aware that this is a Stanford course, but since it's on Coursera and there are many people from other countries that are attending to this course, it will definitely benefit them more by providing more information regarding food and health of other countries. Also I think it might be better to level up the course a little bit. Despite it being an introduction for beginners, half of the content are actually common sense (or maybe just for me, I always pay attention to the food I eat so maybe unconsciously I already knew some knowledge about food and health). But it will be great to have a more advanced course regarding the topic. Food and health is, I would say, the most important thing in life that people should pay attention to. However, so many people just ignore what they eat everyday and don't care about their health. There are also a lot of misunderstandings about what healthy food means and what should people eat when they are on a diet. I really want to help people around me to have a better diet and lifestyle, and hopefully one day I will be able to help more and more people that I don't know of through internet.

It gives a good and basic overview of what includes healthy foods and the problem with processed foods. The use of visual aids in the form of pictures, graphs and short video clips definitely works well with this kind of topic. As an introduction or reminder of good eating habits, this course does its job just fine. However, I did expect more depth. The source material was very short and simple, and the few academic parts (such as the graphics charts and chemical bonds making up some of the nutrients) were quickly glossed over. This also led to many quiz-questions being almost trivial because the answer was pretty much impossible to get wrong. For example, there are many questions of the following kind: ""Q: What is true about vegetables? A: 1.They contain a variety of healthy nutrients. 2. It's better to eat only meat. 3. Processed foods are far healthier. 4. They contain extreme amounts of calories. 5. Supplements are much more effective sources of vitamins."" These kinds of questions do not add any value to the assignment in my opinion. I felt that a little more depth at least would be good (without having to go overboard), and maybe some extra scientific articles (the extra suggested material are all full books, which is a lot to plow through).However, since I understand the course is not meant to be an 8-week academic investment but an introduction to get people interested in topics concerning food and food habits, this course does a fine job of that, and I like the enthusiasm of the speakers!

The course is also incredibly well-structured, with a series of engaging lectures, reading materials, and quizzes that help to reinforce your understanding of the material.What I particularly love about this course is that it's designed to be accessible to everyone, regardless of their background knowledge. Whether you're a total novice or an experienced health professional, you'll find plenty of valuable insights and practical tips to help you make informed decisions about your diet.Another standout feature of this course is the quality of the instructors. The course is led by Dr. Maya Adam, who is an experienced pediatrician and lecturer at Stanford University.

Creo que este curso ofrece un apoyo a nuestros conocimientos sobre la salud, la importancia de la alimentación correcta, la elección de los mejores alimentos, el reto de volver a la cocina casera, en mi país cocinar en casa es lo normal, pero hay un exceso de consumo de refrescos.  Algo que me parece que se omitió es el concepto de la pirámide alimentaria con los diferentes grupos de alimentos que debieran consumirse diariamente para estar saludables.  Se destaca el consumo de vegetales por encima de las proteínas animales y desde luego evitar los alimentos procesados.  Todo ello ayuda a crear conciencia de la importancia de una alimentación correcta.  Aunque siento que no valora otro tipo de alimentación, aquella que se elabora con alimentos de origen natural  como por ejemplo un potaje de garbanzos muy español, elaborado con alubias o garbanzos o un caldo tlalpeño muy mexicano o una tortilla de papas que lleva aceite ¿Hasta donde resultan una comida “sana” según sus parámetros establecidos?  Creo que lo que hemos visto en este curso es una comida muy plana vegetales, pollo, pasta y, para de contar, ok hay que evitar los alimentos procesados, hay que comer muchas verduras pero eso así es muy aburrido, carece de todo interés, yo creo que hay que darle variedad a la comida y que esta reúna todo lo que se requiere en cuanto a su origen natural, pero no centrarse en un plato de pasta, ensalada y carne.

Avoid the middle aisles that have a lot of processed foods.  Also, nutrition facts on foods are less healthy options.  Look for foods with the least amount of ingredients.  Buy organic fruits and vegetables if you can, but even if you can't its better to eat them then not at all.  Also, the recipes at the end are easy to prep and cook.

More info on cheese, potatoes and alcohol would have been welcome. Perhaps also whether deep frozen vegetables  are more /less healthy than fresh ones. In any case,  I greatly enjoyed this course.

Some of the information I did already know but maybe not in a detailed manner.  What I didn't know was cleared up for me.  Most importantly, I truly started to understand the reasoning behind eating whole foods instead of processed foods.  And I've always felt like cooking was too hard or beyond my reach, but after listening and then watching the videos at the end, I feel like maybe it's not so hard.  I haven't had that many successes in the kitchen, but the recipes presented were easy to understand, and not complicated and had simple ingredients.  One thing, I wish those recipes included nutritional information so that we know what we're eating - for those of us who are weight conscious, etc.  Also the instructor is very pleasing to listen to and I enjoyed her take on things.

I even got a bit ""pissed"" cause at the beggining the QUIZZES were ""locked"" with specific dates, and I wanted to continue further and further, I did not want to wait. (I was even complaining about it everywhere I could).But then, when I saw on Monday 4th May, that all QUIZZES were UNLOCKED, I was sooo HAPPY, I immediately continued and finished it all so HAPPILY. It's a very SATISFYING course. Professor MAYA Adam, MD, makes it so SIMPLE and passionating to follow it, that you just want to go on and on with it.

She's very calm, sincere, knowledgeable, interested and aware that the average Joe Schmo doesn't have a heavy background in the sciences to understand a more complex presentation which nutrition is.  I highly recommend this course, because it gives some nutritional terms  and concepts, in the first couple of lessons like the hyper glycemic value of foods, macronutrients, monosaccharides, polysaccharides, intrinsic sugar, amino acids, and metabolic syndrome, but the course doesn't overwhelm you.  I think that Dr. Maya Adam could have given a few more concepts and used some more academic vocabulary.  Dr.  Michael Pollen has an equally calm and sincere way of presenting.  He complements Dr. Maya Adam, and I love his mantra:  ""Eat Food, Not too much/ mostly plants.""  Both instructors aimed to make this course enjoyable, and informative.  Eating the foods we do that may not be helpful to us has to do with mindset and using food for all that ails us.  This latter part should have been addressed more.

Reading  on this course about changing the plate size to reduce the intake of food make me extremely happy.  This course has highlighted many of my (accidentally) healthy changes that I have done this year. It is phenomenal to put creativity and science to understand food. This course is like eating  homemade popcorn, extremely healthy and easy to digest. The language on the quiz changes a bit so it requires a little bit more slow reading.

As a Chinese, I am not really a big fan of North American's fast food and diet, but now I am living in Canada, and the eating culture does affect my life style. I do notice that usually how little vegetables in a Canadian's meal after staying here for a few years. Thanks for this course that I have a clue that how bad fast foods are, the importance of plant-based food and the negative impact of unbalanced food structure to one's life. I hope more and more people can realize the truth of processed food. The most that I have learned from this course is the golden rule: 1/2 plant-based food, 1/4 protein and 1/4 rice or noodle. I have tried it for probably two weeks and it works for me. I have lost some weights and feeling better:) I have also learned how to cook some great dishes! Thanks Maya.",0,1,Xin Shen,28156102

This
course is not all about nutriology or simply introducing any knowledge as I
expected in the first place. In fact, it changes my opinions towards healthy
diet. After taking the course, I know which food to choose for health purpose
and avoid those heavily processed foods that could lead to obesity. And the
most important thing is that I become more positive towards everyday meals. I
don't feel boring during the whole process of preparing food anymore even it is
only for myself and begin to enjoy the pleasure that food brings to me.

I appreciate Michael and Maya for including Indian food and Islamic view on diet . I am a Muslim and born in south India. Based on that I would like to comment on few things;- Quran mentions that eat and drink( any healthy drink except alcohol) but do not transgress; It is more explained in Hadeeth, teachings of prophet Muhammed, peace be upon him that for a man a few morsels are sufficient; if he is still hungry let him fill his stomach with 1/3 food, 1/3 water and 1/3 air. It's a pity that in all developed countries we eat food for fun and pleasure.In South India, Idli is made by soaking rice, black gram(urad dal or uzhunthu) , fenugreek seeds for a few hours, grinding it with salt, fermenting it overnight and steam boiling it the next day. It's balanced with any fresh ground chutney or sambhar(lentil soup) or Idli podi(lentil powder). What Maya showed is called pittu another south Indian dish. In easy blend pancake recipe, baking mix is typed as backing mix. In islamic culture, the theme is 'we are based on what we eat'.That's why it has more guidelines on what we eat and how much we eat and how eat. Unfortunately, we, muslims ignored that guidelines. In India, they are adopting western foods :(Thanks! Looking forward to see more research on the way eat !",0,1,Meharaj Abdul,367419

Some highlights: 0: It is a Scientific approach 1. It considers sustainable goals 2. It considers transitions to the goals - very important part which is often omitted 3. It is does not confront with other models (like vegetarian) - this is the first sign of science (but not otherwise: a lot of people have this way of thinking: ""science - corporations - just for money - bad for health"" - it is obviously logically incorrect way of thinking but wide-spread) 4. It suggest improvements for any income 5. It considers emotional aspects of the solution (this disproves another wide-spread logical error in the area: ""science in food - just nutrients - no emotions"". For those who is trying to do the critical thinking this error is obvious as well - science is about objective knowledge about the real world - and there is enormous science knowledge about areas which study emotions, in this course the knowledge is gracefully used to transfer the information and construct sustainable goals and transitions). 6.
