To make things worse, the 3rd party site you're required to use will provide ZERO product support, since coursera provides you only with a ""lite"" tier account on their site including no tech support (they'll tell you to go back to coursera and ask THEM for help), then coursera will also provide ZERO support since they're not responsible for the other site (I was told to consult the course forum, basically begging other site users for help, and surprise surprise, no help was given).
