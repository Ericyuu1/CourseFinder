11957545~COURSE!~GNtVE1J0EeaAmBJfqzpttQ,1625998394844,5,0,"It is in the Outliers book by Malcolm Gladwell that I first understood the fact that Success is not a self-made achievement but is influenced by various factors like luck, opportunities, external influences such as Family, culture, society etc. However, the research studies and results highlighted in that book are majorly focused on outer achievements. I think the idea that Success is not achieved only because of innate ability has stuck with me ever since. I am not sure if it is the mid-life crisis or something else that led me to anxiety over what has been happening in my life since a few years. I took this course as I felt strongly that I needed some direction in understanding what Success means to me and how to go about achieving my own view of success. The lessons in the first module helped me affirm my views that Success is what you define for yourself based on the values you would like to uphold and the motivations you have whether they are intrinsic or extrinsic. The lessons in the second module directs one to dig deeper into understanding how our values get formed due to various external influences and what capabilities we have developed as our strengths. The third module then talks about the pitfalls of focusing on outer life and achievements. It also helps clearly explain how to achieve success that is sustainable and not fleeting or temporary. The final module helps you put everything together and define our own success path. I have greatly enjoyed listening to the videos as well as spending time on the exercises. Professor Richard Shell has an interesting approach to talk through the concepts by mixing specific examples, research studies, references from various other famous people, as well as excerpts from highly successful personalities. His own personal story is very motivating and influential in its own nature. Overall, I would highly recommend this course if you are someone who wants to understand the true and deeper meaning of success, and various elements to help you achieve your own definition of success.",0,0,Lavanya Yadlapalli,11957545

Awareness is half the battle and it also helps to have the words to articulate concepts that you may already hold but haven't previously described or fully fleshed out. I enjoyed the style and structure of the course, which felt less like a traditional class and more of a discussion among thinkers, perhaps akin to that of the Greeks when they would pose questions and consider concepts as they debated the meaning of things instead of mere factual knowledge addition. This course manages to inspire self-reflection and an almost philosophical understanding of your values while also providing helpful tools and metrics of a sort by which to evaluate and consider these otherwise abstract ideas. I also enjoyed the peer-reviewing aspect as it enables you to journey alongside others in this course and read about their stories and takeaways from the course.

The course is all about finding what is true success _for you_ and not in a generalist way: there is no ""good for everyone"" recipe for success. This passes through analyzing the impact of your biases, cultural values (pro and cons), the heritage that a variety of people gave you in terms of values, examples, pressures and inspirations. Last, it will guide you to write a recipe for you success which will be a snapshot of your evolution journey and you will be encouraged to re-read it in the future to see what you have done and where to go next.Richard Shell spent a very significative part of his young years in a Buddhist monastery in Sri Lanka. To me, a zen practitioner in Thich Nhath Hanh tradition, this is pure gold, since I relate a lot to his vision of a dynamic balance for the individual evolution and life improvement. I also appreciated him sharing some of his personal life-pivoting experiences, something that I think required effort and commitment.I very highly recommend the course and I'd like to say a very special thank you to all this Coursera staff that made this course possibile.I suggest to invest to access to quizzes and grading, since they help a lot to trigger your reflections and reaction.
