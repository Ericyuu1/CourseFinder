82701146~COURSE!~X_ZG4rVzEeWq2A7HIftJ6w,1639666492084,2,0,"This course is useful if you'd like to watch some basic videos about creating comics from real comic book artists, and also useful if you need something outside of yourself to impose deadlines for your creative projects. The peer review aspect is frustrating, however, and all but useless--you either won't get any feedback at all, or you'll get one-word (and sometimes one-character) answers from people who don't care about critiquing your work but want to get credit for doing so. This course is also a few years old (I believe) so some of the resources it offers are out of date or no longer functional, and the subreddit dedicated to the course is all but dead. Still, it's a free course, so if you're interested in some casual comic creation pointers and don't care to receive meaningful feedback from anybody, it's not a waste of your time. I rated it so low simply because the course is designed to rely so heavily on peer reviews, but getting people to finish MOOCs is like herding cats, so I don't really blame Coursera for the lack of engagement from other people taking the course.",0,0,Caroline Lamarque,82701146
18171109~COURSE!~X_ZG4rVzEeWq2A7HIftJ6w,1460009204098,2,0,"I had high expectations of this course, but must admit I'm pretty disappointed. Navigating the course feels unintuitive and clunky. Not sure if that's just a Coursera thing though. The actual content (video) looks great, but is unfortunately exceedingly brief, so much so, that it feels like this entire course could have just been a single article. In fact, there's not much presented that really benefits from the video format. Most 'instruction' in the course is centered around brief talks, or artist interviews, and thus you're often just looking at two people talking, or an artist showing you their work while they talk. You never even see anyone draw to my recollection.The 'work' in the course feels rather 'phoned in' at times too. Questions such as ""What did you find interesting about the video you just watched?"" seem unnecessary, and  too elementary to contain any real value, especially when the videos are so brief.Having said all that, I DO think the people who made it are genuine, and have passion for comics, and comics education, and I'll continue to follow their efforts on that front.",0,11,rafael lewis,18171109

Just be careful of one thing... if you are the type of person who enjoys showcasing a comic that deals largely with life, universe and obscure topics of philisophy....I would recommend you don't do it here. I was constantly being marked down by random people who could not understand a simple concept that all of my other friends could.

My only complaint is that the course seemed rushed and too short for all that you need to cover and create in some weeks.  I still would not hesitate to recommend this course because it is complete.
