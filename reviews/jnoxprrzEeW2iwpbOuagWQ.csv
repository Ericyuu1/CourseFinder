41195652~COURSE!~jnoxprrzEeW2iwpbOuagWQ,1612087688477,5,0,"This is an interesting and excellent course on how our nervous system (not just our brain) makes sense of, processes and responds to the external physical space. There is a great and gradual mix of easy, moderate and challenging topics which can cement key concepts (especially those that you can observe or replicate on your own) quite well. For people in or aiming to be in the (allied) medical professions, a lot of the material here can serve as a review in basic neuroanatomy, neurophysiology and/or neuropathology. A double-edged sword in this offering is the inclusion and description of landmark studies behind the discussed concepts. There is no doubt that by mentioning these studies, the collaborative and building-up nature of (neuro)science is emphasized adequately - that everything in academic textbooks and in this course did not appear in scientists' minds out of thin air. The downside, on the other hand, is that it sometimes left me wondering the proportion of these findings that are definitive or tentative. Considering the issue of replication that hounds all of empirical science research, it would be nice, I think, that future revisions of this course will incorporate statements or discussions on these matters (i.e, whether the findings are robust, or can be explained by other factors/forces beyond chance).While I would argue that a baseline grasp of neurobiology is needed to maximize understanding of the content (especially when it comes to nuanced details which are often tackled in the quizzes), I will still highly recommend this course to everyone deeply beguiled by the topic (and can commit their attention beyond casual learning).
