Key take aways. are: Every Video is short and crisp, and each video is followed by transcript with hyperlinks. If one watches the video, the transcript gives view point and hyperlinks really makes you ready for the quiz which is the following section. Every problem in the course, gives exposure to various methodologies and reason for using them. Finally, the notebooks which were shared both local version and Watson version. This in turn giving you liberty to use Cloud platform to get hands on. Great content, thank you",0,0,Nagendra Prasad Ponnaganti,45304285
