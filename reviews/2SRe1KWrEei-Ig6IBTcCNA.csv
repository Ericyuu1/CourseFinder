64932658~COURSE!~2SRe1KWrEei-Ig6IBTcCNA,1595577622992,1,0,The answers given by us are not accepted by you guys. I don't know why on earth do you people design such courses whose questions are itself wrong. You guys are making us perplexed and puzzled at the same time. We are investing time for learning something and instead you guys are taking money from us and creating a big fool of us. If you have proper formula towards certain problems why don't you prescribe in your videos? Why are you harassing us? Is it because you want us to spend more number of weeks against the 2-3 problems of these above mentioned weeks and you will get more money from us? The policy won't work if you can't rectify your mistakes and moreover this course is strictly NOT TO BE RECOMMENDED TO ANYONE... Its that you guys have a certain set of answers to those problems and those answers I CHALLENGE YOU THEY ARE FILTHY WRONG. I HAVE SPENT TWO DAYS WITH THESE PROBLEMS. I HAVE 24 HOURS IN HAND LIKE YOU HAVE. PLEASE DO SOMETHING CONSTRUCTIVE AND DON'T PLAY THESE VISCOUS TACTIS WITH US. I see there are so many students who are asking for help and you guys can't even answer to the problems. Shitty course.. shittiest of all I did....My bad luck in trusting people like you and losing money in return. Shame on you. If you can't handle with the subjects at least don't make us confused and don't make a mockery of yourself. Worst service ever.,0,19,Rahul Ghose,64932658
16887658~COURSE!~2SRe1KWrEei-Ig6IBTcCNA,1660195222788,2,0,"The taught content is practical and detailed but the quizzes are absolutely soul-destroying. They are filled with bugs and errors (rounding errors, miscalculations in spreadsheets) that force you to trawl through the thread comments of previous students from years ago to validate your working out. It seems as if Macquarie are 'setting and forgetting' the course as there seems to be minimal assistance from instructors. It flat out doesn't work in this format. Couldn't recommend this in good conscience.",0,0,Gavin Payne,16887658
7386099~COURSE!~2SRe1KWrEei-Ig6IBTcCNA,1655250726768,2,0,"That course is mostly an enumeration of financial formulas the ones after the others with very few fast presentation of examples... Calculus are based on some given Excel spreadsheets that we cannot really reuse and trust... At least 3 weekly graded quizzes expect values that we can very hardly calculate and/or that do not fit in the box for we don't know why reasons... A total absence of help from the teaching staff, no mentors to help either! Impossibility to respond to other students struggling because replies are subject to approval... They call graded quizzes formal tests, I instead call that very badly designed quizzes with no real teaching value! It again all looks like it was designed to challenge the professors and the instructors, not the learners! The learners them, will only drop the course, or will end totally frustrated! Well, all that is giving a very bad image of the Macquarie University for sure, and is saying a lot at the psychological level! So sad! And a big nonsensical learning journey finally...
