Specialization that was prepared and
lead by Nancy Wang, a Head of Product at Amazon (AWS), who also was a Product
Manager at Google and is a CEO and Founder of Advancing Women in Product
(AWIP). Nancy shares her knowledge gained throughout her career in those extremely
successful companies.The specialization is a combo of 4 courses to learn product
management from different perspectives: customer obsession, market sizing,
competitive analyses, success metrics (like KPIs, OKRs, North Stars, A/B/n
tests, NPS, CSAT, CES, cohort analyses, LTV, pricing, and financials), etc.The big advantage of this course is it helps you to create your
own portfolio through studying all 4 courses by developing your own product
using real-life PM tasks during product management lifecycle from inception
till launch. Each task takes about an hour. This work is peer-reviewed and you
get real feedback. Even though it is quite time-consuming to do those practical
assignments and peer review assignments of other students, it helps to get
practical knowledge and learn things by doing, which is especially extremely
important for folks who want a transition to a PM role and have no real
experience yet. Another advantage is that you get trained using real PM
interview questions. Nancy shares questions from giants like Amazon, Google,
Facebook, and Microsoft and helps to master their Behavioral, Product Design,
Strategy, Estimation, and Technical interview questions.Also, it was super useful to listen to interviews and panels
that Nancy did with successful senior Product Managers and Leaders in Product
where they shared their experience, insights, and tips for PM career, things
they are looking for in PM candidates. On top of that Nancy shares great sources for networking to
advance your career as a Product Manager.I highly recommend every Product Manager to take this up!!Thank you to Nancy Wang and the rest of #AWIP for putting this course together!I learned so much that I am excited to take into my current and
