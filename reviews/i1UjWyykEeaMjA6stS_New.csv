120220491~COURSE!~i1UjWyykEeaMjA6stS_New,1672840780312,2,0,"The content is somewhat relevant. The relevant parts are extremely useful. Problem is, that very often we can observe a debate in the ivory tower of academia without practical, evidence-based content. Also, the structure of the course is bleeding. The final grading is peer-based so it is a pain and you don't know when and how you receive a certificate.",0,0,Szilárd Burján,120220491
52648338~COURSE!~i1UjWyykEeaMjA6stS_New,1586873601899,2,0,Nice intro to Sustainability in Scandinavia and Scandinavian culture.  A bit repetitive and very focused on a single company (it would have been good to compare against what other good and poor CSR performers in the region are doing).   Not a particularly taxing course (takes a couple of days to go through) and very easy (almost insultingly) assessments.,0,0,Shyam Gharial,52648338

75862776~COURSE!~i1UjWyykEeaMjA6stS_New,1636478258382,4,0,"The actual course material was great, but the final grading system is severely flawed. On two questions with a scale of 0-4, with 2 being 'sufficient response', you will fail if you lose more than 1 point. Thus being rated 'strong response' on two questions by your peers, you will still fail the course. On resubmitting you go back into the queue and enter an endless cycle of your study time expiring and being repeatedly failed by well meaning peers who probably think they are giving you a good score.

It would be fabulous to learn a bit more about triple-bottom line economics and what steps an organization needs to take to switch from its current financial model to a more CSR-based model. I don't know if that exists, or if the org starts by setting aside a budget for the exploratory phase and then assigns budget (with accountability goals and targets) as time passes?Thanks,Jessica    ",0,0,Jessica Alba,48352616
