25138831~COURSE!~D6wKTFSTEeqIdQr9mYZ_6w,1656273259211,5,0,"  Pierre here, I just want to leave a feedback on the course that I recently finished. I took this course in order to fill gaps in my knowledge in microwave engineering.  So first of all, I have several remarks on the antennas part:
 1) this part was very useful for me. I appreciate the math explanations of antennas function, without the latter this devices look like magic:)
 2) as for numerical methods, some mentioning of other methods might be useful, for a more broad view, I think.
 Next about a part on amplifiers:
 1) noise and gain matching was personally more complex for me than other parts. I would prefer to have more details on the noise and gain circles, I have found a deviation of these formulas in Pozar, however  there were less information in the course. Also, it was not clear for me why this formulas give circles in Smith chart. There is an answer in literature, for example in the theory of complex variable. Namely, we are plotting impedance on the smith chart , it is calculated from the reflection coefficient using linear fractional transformation, and as far as I understand the Smith chart itself is a linear fractional transformation of the coordinate axes. These transforms keep the circular shapes, so the circle |Gamma| =const will give a circle on the Smith chart. To sum up, this kind of explanation will help me to understand better. 
 2) In general, I think that this part was fast, and maybe some slowing down and more details would be appreciated. But maybe it is just me
 3) as for stability, I think it would be good to give an example of an unstable amplifier, what happens to a signal, for example.
 4) I find the circles on the Smith chart an interesting topic. However, I think it is important to add an information about software that can draw circles on the chart (I personally could not find a proper way at QUCS). Also, some explanation how to draw circles on paper would be useful, something like that : https://youtu.be/aPy_X67YbLk . I was not clear for me how to draw circle, where is |Gamma| = 1 Anyway, thanks a lot for the course, it is very interesting and useful. And I will use and have used the knowledge and skills in my career, for sure. With my best regards,
 Pierre ",0,2,Petr Polovodov,25138831
