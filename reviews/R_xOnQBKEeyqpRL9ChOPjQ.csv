68007704~COURSE!~R_xOnQBKEeyqpRL9ChOPjQ,1655402600337,1,0,"Took the class with the intention of practicing concepts and getting a taste of how University of Colorado Boulder conducts their online classes, because I was interested in the Master of Science in Data Science.   The class was good, could have been better, but that's not issue.  Several students, including myself, are complaining on the group forum because there's a programing error on the last quiz.  We are unable to submit the answer and thus we get and automatic fail on the test.  It's been over a week, my deadline to complete the course is about to expire and no one from the school has answered a single word.  Apparently I'm going to fail a class, because the quiz doesn't work and the moderators are MIA. ",0,9,cecilia wolfson,68007704

75758830~COURSE!~R_xOnQBKEeyqpRL9ChOPjQ,1676184641075,4,0,"Excellent course. I would recommend  that the videos spend an additional minute preparing the student for the upcoming quiz by virtue of a pertinent example that incorporates the algebra, etc. that the quizzes require. The videos as they are do not cover all of the techniques required to complete the quiz. Also, it might be worth it after taking the quiz, to show step by step how the course solves a problem for any problem the student gets correct, so as to compare the approaches used.

106759622~COURSE!~R_xOnQBKEeyqpRL9ChOPjQ,1671777219548,5,0,"This course is really good if you have done calculus before but can't remember any of it after years of not using it. It's quick and the lectures are short and to the point.  No time is wasted, and it just enough to refresh the basic intuitions behind calculus as well as help you remember the derivative rules.  It is not going to be a super fun experience if you are horribly rusty on basic algebra.  Although the first two weeks of the course review algebra, they aren't super thorough and the exercises won't be enough to rework your brain into being comfortable with algebra.  If this describes you, you'll want to take some time to practice algebra first.  The calculus part of the course is pretty simple, but there are places where you'll do quite a bit of multiplying polynomials, and this is absolutely painful if you haven't done that in over a decade.  I think Jane Wall is a great lecturer.  If I have any major criticism of the course, I think she should lecture even more.  I'd love to see 2-3 more examples for each topic worked out in videos.

And searched for what is the prerequisites to begin study of statistics, economics and data science. And made a scheme of learning objectives and was looking for classes to teach subjects on that objective. But it was too overwhelming to study all those subjects, since when watching videos, I know some of them and don't know some. So I couldn't skip but to watch all of the videos.But finding this course, it was just prepared what I need to know in a very systematic and practical manner. Teaching was amazingly simple.
