Then, I told me to create a new account with a new email to solve the issue.

But the most frustrating thing is the final test. It requires you to register at IBM Cloud and using their platform Watson. However, I couldn't even register properly because my bank did not approve the transaction. It's not worth it to even try to fix that through the bank, because the course has been disappointing so far, and hence I don't trust the final test. They should just give you tasks to perform in Jupyter or RStudio, which is way simpler than going through all this Watson adventure. They should give these tasks throughout the course as well. It seems that the course only exists to promote IBM Cloud and such.",0,9,William Lima da Silva Pinto,99499243

This certification is designed and envisioned by those without experience in adult learning/pedagogy/course design. The result is frustration.
