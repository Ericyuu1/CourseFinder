114962774~COURSE!~lEJhkLrCEeiBDxIhuJBKEA,1669875956722,1,0,"It is unclear who might benefit from this course as it barely touches the specifics of online teaching per se but  attempts to ""shed light"" on some aspects of teaching ESL in general. As a result,  if you are a seasoned instructor transitioning to online teaching, you won't get much insight into best practices, and if you're a novice in teaching ESL, then the material is too limited. On top of that, the ""innovative"" way to present the material with a journey storyline is irrelevant and serves no useful purpose. Plus, numerous spelling errors and wrongly formulated quiz questions make the whole experience daunting.",0,1,Olga Chong,114962774

13310127~COURSE!~lEJhkLrCEeiBDxIhuJBKEA,1590075487865,2,0,"I was really disappointed with this course. I have done 2 other courses (MOOCs) through Coursera, which were really excellent. When I saw that this course  was presented by Arizona State Uni, I expected it to be of a very high calibre, but uncovered the sad truth that it was the opposite. For example, the readings were riddled with errors and had they been run through a basic spelling and grammar checker, these could have rectified. The transcriptions were not accurate, full of errors and Braedon's (lead male role in the videos) name was spelled in at least 4 different ways. The formatting was almost nonexistent.Whilst the overall concept of the videos (Braedon's world tour) was interesting, the execution was very sub-standard for a US university. I found Emelia's mannerisms quite puerile at times, and could the producer not have afforded a second videocam or smartphone to take 2 shots of the conversation scenes? Theses scenes came across as totally unnatural with both participants looking at the single camera, whereas in a normal conversation, they would be looking at each other.There was no formatting of readings until unit 6, just straight text with no headers, bold, underlining, etc. So really boring and not engaging at all. With just a little effort, the readings for the first 5 units and the transcripts of videos could have formatted neatly to make them much more useful and readable, for instance, by separating the script per speaker.On the whole, once I could figure it out, the content was quite useful, though something that could be addressed is the various activities which could be used per skill when teaching online and especially with a single student.

A human would have marked my initial response correct. Some of the multiple-choice, multiple-answer questions were also frustrating, such as ""why do you take notes during the lesson?"" -- there would be one answer clearly supported by the course material, but the lesson quizzes demanded multiple answers to be marked correct.

I mostly work with kindergarten and English learners, so I wanted to do anything possible to better assist the teachers and students I support. This course had taught me fundamentals on how to be more patient and understanding with students' struggles, a better understanding of language acquisition in general, and how important well-thought out feedback is to leaners. These skillsets and more have helped me be a better ""teacher"" during breakout rooms, and transfer the aid we give teachers in a physical classroom to a virtual one.
