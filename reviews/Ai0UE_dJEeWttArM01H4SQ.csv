51310284~COURSE!~Ai0UE_dJEeWttArM01H4SQ,1589041692556,4,0,"I enjoyed the course and found it both interesting and stimulating.  The reason I did not give it 5stars was two-fold.  Firstly the written copy of the speeches of the presenters needs to be proof read.  There were numerous spelling and grammar errors.  There were omissions and inappropriate substitutions. This seems like use was made of a program to change speech into text which was good for the vast majority of text but not all of the text.  I expect higher standards from Yale university., I felt it spend too much time on the catholic reformation and not enough on the Protestant reformation.  The Catholic Church has reformed itself many time but the most important religious event of the 15th and 16th  centuries was the Protestant reformation which resulted in a major schism in Christianity.  In addition very little time was spent on the abuses in the Catholic Church which  was a major cause of the schism.   I am not saying that time should not be spent on the catholic reformation  ",0,2,Iain Murray,51310284

In terms of constructive feedback, I think it would be even better if readings included summaries/overviews of topics.

Good representation of the economic, political, and cultural context of this evolution.  I learned a lot, fleshing out the things I'd previously picked up in grade school world history and art history courses.  Excellent choice for anybody interested in European history and religion.  My only complaint is the lead professor's lecture style, which seemed off-the-cuff and halting and stream-of-consciousness, even though his content was very much on point.  I often read the transcripts of his videos rather than listen to his voice.  Also, it would have been nice to have more dynamic videos like I've seen in other courses from Yale via Coursera.

I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in the topic of church history. I hope they make a part 2 someday, from 1650 to the present. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the transcriptions are poor, I assume being done by a generic speech to text program, and this will be a problem for people either totally unfamiliar with the material, or perhaps have English as a second language. Often the names of historical names and places and people are incorrect in the transcriptions, and if you are not sure what the instructor said, it could get confusting. For example when the instructor said ""Constantine"" in one place it was transcribed as constant time. Not a big deal for some, but for others could be very confusing. I would offer to volunteer for some transcribing but there doesn't seem to be a way to convenientally contact anyone at Coursera.",0,3,Greg Cooper,29262951

He brings this complex topic to life through his focus on the individual people who impacted and were impacted by their times as our context for understanding the broader social and theological events that were occurring. I not only learned much, but enjoyed doing so. Therefore the course certainly fulfilled my expectations. I rated it four stars rather than five however because I missed interactivity. The discussion area was not really utilized and many posts were not only old, apparently from an earlier presentation of the course, but went unanswered or with no dialogue by other participants.

Hay áreas temáticas que podrían discutirse un poco más, aunque entiendo las limitaciones de tiempo que tienen las grabaciones de video. Por ej., en el caso de la reforma inglesa, no queda clara la controversia con relación a la autoridad papal y los intereses personales de Eduardo VIII: la tradición histórica dice que el problema que conllevó a la ruptura con el papado fue la negativa de permitir el divorcio del rey con Catalina de Aragón. El papa impidió el dejar sin efecto el matrimonio de los reyes ingleses para favorecer que Eduardo pudiera casarse con Ana Bolena. Queda en el aire la interrogante: ¿La iglesia anglicana surge como contraposición a un interés personal o no?

It provided a good outline for further specialized reading. One piece of specialized reading, The Romance of the Rose, probably should be eliminated from the course.  To little was said about the shoddy behavior of Christians, especially by Theodosius in the late 4th century, by Charlemagne, by the Crusaders and by the Inquisitors. Was the deep faith held by medieval Christians a cause or effect of such great violence? Or both? While taking this course, I supplemented the required lectures and reading with the following books: Christianity: The First Three Thousand Years, by Diarmaid MacCulloch; Thomas Aquinas: A Portrait, by Denys Turner; God's Crucible: Islam and the Making of Europe, 570-1215; and Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, by Johan Huizinga.
