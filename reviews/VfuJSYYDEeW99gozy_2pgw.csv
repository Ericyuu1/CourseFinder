70706895~COURSE!~VfuJSYYDEeW99gozy_2pgw,1646297196946,1,0,"A​s a Romani activist scholar currently working at Cornell University, I appalled that this course blatantly erases us Romani from Holocaust Studies. It is violent and racist to ignore the second category of peoples targeted under the final solution - a race who was never acknowledged, recognized, memorialized and who never received reparations. It is deeply concerning to see that these gadje Professors are teaching folks that the Holocaust was merely the murder of Jewish people. The fight that me and countless other Romani activists have to fight to merely be recognized is atrocious and it is in large part due to teachers like this. There are zero excuses for this type of violence, erasure, and racism in this field.",0,2,Jordan Ferrari,70706895
