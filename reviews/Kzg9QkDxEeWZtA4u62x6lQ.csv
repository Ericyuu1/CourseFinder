impact on the American Civil Rights Movement by Black Power: young, gifted and
black (Nina Simone).""Art as Experience"" by John Dewey is a very inspiring standard oeuvre about the function
of art in a modern society. Art and culture are essential to the development of
a peaceful way of living together based on respect and mutual understanding for
each other within a society and more than that; this must be seen and
explicitly recognized by politicians and politicians (John F. Kennedy).The only
thing that should be considered in the future is the extensive use of
