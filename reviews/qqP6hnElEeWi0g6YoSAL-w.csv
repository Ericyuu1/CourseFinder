It just scratches the surface of ArcMap, but it gives you a good base (or working knowledge). I feel more confident using ArcMap now, and ready to learn more about it.The training is well thought out, but is fast-paced. I recommend that you pay close attention in the lectures, and do all the exercises, even the ""extra practice"" ones because the final project will use a lot of what was presented.Speaking of these ""extra practice"" exercises, they are located in a companion book that you can buy, but the book is not required for the course. I recommend getting it because it is nice to be able to pick it up and reference it if there is a topic you don't quite understand.  You can find used copies on Amazon.This isn't a negative, but I think that the estimate of 3 to 5 hrs/week is optimistic.
