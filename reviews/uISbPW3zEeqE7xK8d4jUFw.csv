37347576~COURSE!~uISbPW3zEeqE7xK8d4jUFw,1634744406846,1,0,"I don't recommend this course. Because in each week it's only a long video from the instructor providing vague concepts and most of the videos are histories from his past jobs. The lectures are a copy paste from articles from the internet. And the final project it's not related to procurement, it's more to manufacture processs. I had worked in procurement and I did not find any key concept or any exercise worth it. If you are new in the field you may not like procurement after taking this course",0,1,Hellen Carolina Hernández,37347576

As a result, I have to wait multiple days, sometimes even a full week in order to completed a course within this program.

Update...several days later, and still no peer review available. This program is dysfunctional and I would never recommend it to anyone. I would like a refund asap!
