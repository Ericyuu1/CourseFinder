You can get much better content online for free. Does Coursera review the content prior to posting? Not likely as basic English errors would have been rectified. The instructors C terminology is wrong in many places. This is just absolutely the worst.",0,4,Deleted Account,85341959

The teacher explains the structure of the C programming language and the tasks are clearly given and engaging.However, the teacher forgot to explain the role of ""return0"" as stated in the beginning of he course.Cons: The accent is strong, and it took me to rewind several times to try to understand what the teacher is saying.
