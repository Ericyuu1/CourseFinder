76790011~COURSE!~Au01o-iWEeqeURJGKnSBBw,1605887759417,4,0,"Good course and a good instructor. I just wish the course went a little more in-depth in some aspects for eg with the ML model since it is already written beforehand (although he does go over it and explain it, it would have been nice to implement it ourselves). The rest is great though - perfect for anyone interested in getting started with Flask applications or AWS!",0,0,Ken Johnson,76790011
