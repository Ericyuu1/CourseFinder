9757703~COURSE!~re8cOiHDEeuw5wqfqZhzNw,1648444771601,3,0,"Good content, but the delivery could be better.  The course is old (Sep 2020) and needs updating, since AWS changes some services (e.g. Elastic Search is now OpenSearch).  Not worth the price.  Videos with screen shots and sequwnce of steps are useful; videos with 'talking heads"" and generic statements are not useful .  Sections can be improved with more motivated examples.The discussion forums were useless -- the instructors did not respond to questiuons and requests for help.  Also, three labs werre planned but only one was published and accessible.",0,0,Eugene Belogay,9757703

Specifically, the instructors briefly walk you through different parts of designing data lakes: data ingestion (Kinnesis Family, AppFlow, API Gateway, Snow Family, Data Exchange), data storage (S3), data catalog (Glue Crawler, Glue Data Catalog), data processing (Glue Job, Lambda, EMR), data visualization and exploration (Kibana), machine learning (SageMaker).After the course,  you'll have a roadmap to dive into your interested topics.",0,0,Chu Van An,232485
