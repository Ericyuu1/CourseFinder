I posted a link twice with a request to check on the forum. I checked more than a dozen other works and in the review I left a link to my work with a request to check in response. I wrote to support. And nothing happened. At the moment, I don't have a single grade for this work, while three are needed to complete the course. I deliberately completed all the course assignments by the beginning of August in order to be able to attach a certificate to my CV and look for a job by the beginning of the academic year.

Then it takes them 6-7 weeks, which is outrageous and would not fly at any real college or university.  In effect, it just makes you pay for another month of the course, while you are learning nothing.   Then, to get a simple piece of paper with your certificate costs the equivalent of another month of the course.

However, the time spent waiting for them to process things is entirely unprofessional. After you spend all that time doing the work, and the many hours creating your profile, in a ""work at your own pace"" course, you are lead to believe that you will then receive your certificate - but no. It takes 4-6 weeks for your profile to be mentor reviewed, and an additional 4-6 weeks to receive your ASU TESOL certificate. This is up to 12 weeks of pure waiting! This is not ""work at your own pace."" This is ""wait up to 3 months to receive the certificates that you and your employer likely need now."" They need to be more upfront at the very beginning that there will be such a long wait at the very end.

I have no words to express how delighted I am to finally get this certificate after completing the two parts of the specialization. It is more than a certificate for me. I am from Pakistan and our country does not offer such opportunities. The British Council here doesn't even offer CELTA or DELTA for Pakistan. I went all the way to Malaysia for this. However, my experience there was bitter. So imagine how elated I was when I saw ASU offering a language related course online. It was my biggest desire in 2012 and after waiting so many years I came across this course on coursera and had an opportunity to learn teaching, lesson planning, designing and much more. I thought TEACHER TALK was rubbish and waste of time. This specialization has changed me as a teacher. It has evolved me as a teacher. Thanks, Dr. Shane, Dr. Justin and Ms. Jessica for all of it.
