112545339~COURSE!~U4WBswpyEeuHYg6ONVEFIw,1668142089757,1,0,I hate this course because it has so much programming and I want only quiz for this course.,0,0,Swati Maheswaraguru,112545339
102460388~COURSE!~U4WBswpyEeuHYg6ONVEFIw,1650697077666,1,0,T​he assignments are not related to the course at all. No extra help or knowledge were given before we hit the training of python or pandas. ,0,0,Dodge Ho,102460388
78393993~COURSE!~U4WBswpyEeuHYg6ONVEFIw,1650395396641,1,0,T​his should not be on Coursera! The lab assignments are filled with errors. No one gets the results they ask. T​here is no feedback from the course directors on the disscussionforum!!,0,0,Aart Spilt,78393993
67885607~COURSE!~U4WBswpyEeuHYg6ONVEFIw,1649102816467,1,0,"T​he content overall is good and the course has potential, but the developer lacks attention to detail in the programming assignments; the programming assignments are also repetitive.  If you just want to understand a very high level of how to apply a DNN to a healthcare problem using PyTorch, this will get you started. Hopefully the next courses in this specialization are better.",0,0,Jason Inzana,67885607

90724096~COURSE!~U4WBswpyEeuHYg6ONVEFIw,1654700809098,2,0,"This course is in my opinion designed for people who already know how to do deep learning but want to do an application in health care.The isn't a proper teaching for deep learning, just test to verify that you know what you are doing.I have tried to do this course and everything I learned while doing the test was by doing my own research",0,0,DEMONT Vincent,90724096
5295250~COURSE!~U4WBswpyEeuHYg6ONVEFIw,1649165980247,2,0,Extremely poor assignment guide. Most of assignments have ambiguous instructions wasting a lot of time,0,0,SIDDHARTH PRASAD DESHPANDE,5295250
1427998~COURSE!~U4WBswpyEeuHYg6ONVEFIw,1675742727945,3,0,"The course material is well presented, good as an introduction, but I'm not the only one who had problems with poorly designed labs and homework in Jupyter.Why do we practice Pytorch in the first place to eventually begin graded assignment like ""here you have Pandas, use it to do this, this and that"" and without informing that dataset is corrupted! So after hours of frustration you have to read the forums and then figure out how to solve it. There is no way to see the issue in a dataset with 600k records. The tasks don't seem difficult after doing them. I know it's an advanced course, but why almost every academic course I took online is poorly delivered? I've used to have homework that doesn't cover learning material at all. But in case of online course there is no way to get feedback or help from colleagues.",0,0,Ernest Warzocha,1427998
