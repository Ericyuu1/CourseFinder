The difficulty is fine, could be more challenging actually and also require you to do more than what was explained in the videos. The annoying part are the unit tests. I almost always get a fail even though my functions return the expected output. I have compared my function to the solution and I always get the same results. I do not know how the unit tests are designed but they do not fulfill their purpose. It is frustrating that I have to write functions in a pre-dedfined way to get a pass even though my function generates exactly the same output. Even more frustrating that the explanatiosn in the notebooks do not explain why the function has to be written exactly in that way, when a  more efficient way with less or even no for loops is possible. I would recommend to rather play around and write your own classes on your local machine and compare output to scikit-learn algorithms.

108058319~COURSE!~hD8t4jWeEeu9vAr5jUgnDQ,1659674146308,5,0,This was an amazing first course to take. I was originally taking the original Machine Learning course when this came out. I switched and it was a very welcome change. Using Tensorflow and Python instead of Octave/Matlab was nice and getting to learn from all the advances was really cool. The interactive notebooks made learning really fun and much easier to get my hands on the material.,0,0,Austin Sonderman,108058319

The unsupervised and recommender weeks were a little tougher while reinforcement learning was definitely a friendly introduction with a fun assignment.   Great instruction and clearly a lot of time invested into making interesting assignments (very much appreciate the change to python from octave).  ,0,0,James Pope,1057455

I was able to quickly build a decent foundation on UL while enjoying the content and exercises. As in the other spezialization courses, each topic starts with the algorithm intuition before jumping into the specific math and nuances. The jupyter notebooks are excellent, I found them super effective to understand the practical implementations of K-means clustering for image compression, Gaussian distributions for anomaly detection, collaborative (and content) filtering for movie recommendations, and reinforcement learning for a virtual lunar lander 🤖 Many Thanks!
