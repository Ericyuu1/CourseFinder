88732296~COURSE!~nPlUsfGuEemVQQ7lhvAbwA,1644095738961,3,0,"G​ood course - needs an update.  With  last two years of COVID think that the general conclusion in Week 1 about highly developed countries just dealing with chronic disease instead of epidemics needs to be caveated. Also in discussing the Affordable Care Act, please note that there is no longer a penalty involved (court decision) for not having insurance. Think the instructor somewhat biased in favor of universal health care - comment on US system ""how do they get away with that"".  Also mentioned that ""several of Dem candiates in 2016 favored universal health care"" but in fairness need to mention that neither of the Dem nominees in 2016 or 2020 favored that.  Suggest that a look at Canada for comparison might be valid since their geography (large rural as well as urban centers) is more comparable to US.  ",0,0,Marianna Merritt,88732296
37151228~COURSE!~nPlUsfGuEemVQQ7lhvAbwA,1595714531185,3,0,"The course actually leaves me quite confused - there are a few points of criticism/ of warning I want to put out there. First, the content of the multiple choice assessments does not line up with the pace and style of the lectures. I struggled hard to answer the questions (and thought ""Wait, he talked about this?""), even though I paid close attention to the videos. For example, a lot of emphasis was placed on numbers - this much GDP, that much mortality - whereas the questions were about the reasons why a specific method was abandoned.Second, the course is structured into different country systems. This means that I received all the information at once about the US, then about Germany, etc etc. I would have been able to study better if the different building blocks of a health system (for example insurance, or hospitals) had been compared with each other. For instance, as an introductory course, I would have hoped to just understand what insurance IS in the first place, and how it can be structured differently around the world.Third, the lecturer did not seem comfortable reading from the screen. I barely remembered anything of what he said in the lectures, because he just read it off, but in short discussion videos, he spoke freely and I was able to follow much, much better. He speaks more naturally and is much better at explaining in those rare instances where he only has notes!However, the course was free, and I really, really appreciate that. ",0,0,,37151228

The approaches adopted by different countries to achieve universal health coverage are amazing. The course would help me practice in another country after completing my professional doctorate degree in the US.

I also enjoyed the questions before the video with the answer. It made me think, instead of just watching and learning what was being said. I also loved the first video, where the professor suggested us to do a self-assessment. I learned a lot and was very motivated to watch the next video, because they were interesting. The professor is amazing and organized and the content is engaging. Thank you very much!",0,1,MARCELA DIAS HANNA,13032377
