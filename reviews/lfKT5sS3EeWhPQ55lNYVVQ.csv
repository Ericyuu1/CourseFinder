12723511~COURSE!~lfKT5sS3EeWhPQ55lNYVVQ,1653788307783,3,0,"I really appreciate The World Bank making this course so affordable. I think it's very timely and relevant today. The content is enriching and informative. You learn a lot about how various countries are tackling climate change, the challenges they face and the opportunities they can explore from a policy perspective. But the reason I've marked the course with a lower rating is - the course did not contain any information about how individuals can contribute to climate change reversal, through their actions. This is not a course for a beginner. Most of the content is based on scientific papers and uses jargon that many of us non-scientists would be unfamiliar with. The speakers read from a script and deliver the videos, instead of having conversations - which makes the video more difficult to follow, since they're reading from reports and research papers. That's another problem - the research used is too dated and stems from the 2009-2015 period. There are slides with photos of graphs which haven't been explained and are difficult to understand. In a nutshell, this course is for someone already familiar with the scientific terminology, theories and background of environmentalism, climate change and sustainability. If you're looking for a beginner-friendly course, I would suggest looking elsewhere first and then following that up with this course. It would add more value then. However, this course is ideal if you are in the Government sectot, are a policy maker, an environmental lawyer or a company who is trying to meet their sustainability goals. Overall, you do learn a lot from this - but its not particularly helpful to acquaint non-scientists with what we can do on our part, to use climate science for action in our day to day lives. The peer review assignments are easy to do and don't take much time. But the quizzes are difficult given the scientific jargon they contain. But you do learn by searching for the meaning of these complicated terms as you do the quiz. ",0,1,Nisha Prakash,12723511

17710985~COURSE!~lfKT5sS3EeWhPQ55lNYVVQ,1605476061470,4,0,"This is an excellent course on the status of our global climate crisis.It's an huge and complex subject. It covers far more than can be readily covered in a four-week course, even if students could devote their full time to it.Acknowledging that fact, it would be better if this course were less ambitious about the amount of material it covers.  For example, many of the readings are listed as 10-minute tasks.  In fact, the reading assignment may entail one or more scientific papers with some depth.  To read these adequately would take several hours.As of this date (November 2020), much of the material in this course is several years old.  It's still pertinent and is not necessarily out of date, but when updates in climate science come so quickly, reading conference papers from 2013 makes you wonder how current it is.The final assignment was to have students to prepare a video on climate change, how it affects them, and to think about what actions they could take to reduce the impact of climate change.  This was a good exercise because it forced students to review and reflect on the situation and what can be done.I certainly appreciate the immense effort that went into assembling the huge amount of material for this course.  And I realize that updating the course would also be an immense task.  That would be another reason for building a ""lite"" version of this course - it could be updated more often.Overall, this is a great course, and I wish that more people would take it so they could learn what's happening to our climate and what we must do to avoid catastrophe.",0,2,James Wang,17710985

Weare also behind time in prevention of climate change and this course is a spot on the issue because we need immediate actio yesterday. We have Sustainable Development Goals which is the platform to guide us but climate change has already happened and now we need to stop it meaning firstly people should understand what is climate change and how disasterous it will get then it will be easier to apply the SDG's where it matters. I dare say that 80% of the global communities including the rural folks , meaning nobody left behind, does not know what is the SDG's and how to apply the methods or preventive methods for climate change. It is only due to the natural disasters which had and is taking place as I type this feedbak statements, that is slowly creating the awareness on climate change.

I was impressed by the careful organization not only of the topics, but also of the exercises, especially the optional ones, which really helped to dive into specific details of the material, and were key to see things in practice. I have one suggestion for improvement. Although the videos were all of high quality, I think having 5-10 min videos with a single person speaking in front of a camera is not effective in conveying messages, especially because it is clear they are reading from a script. People behave and communicate more effectively when they are not reading directly form a curated text. the results is that reading the transcript of the video was better than watching the video itself. My suggestion would be to have conversations and/or debates on video, and leave detailed information for the written material. Finally the entire course was impressive for the knowledge and expertise of all the people involved, and despite my limited time I have also learned some important from the discussion forums.
