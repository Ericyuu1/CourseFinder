53008208~COURSE!~_XPene4TEequBBK5tM7bMQ,1628261758769,2,0,"OK course, but an absolutely hideous implementation. You must use a virtual Windows machine in Rhyme. Rhyme is super annoying to use, and your actual workspace ends up being about the size of a mobile phone screen. It also has a session extension limit and video won't play if you click outside the tab (so you can't open a normal Jupyter Notebook and work there), it keeps switching the screens. If I wasn't desperate, I would have quit. The course will teach you how to build a pairwise distance recommender system without external frameworks. The author often uses single lines of advanced code which can be difficult to follow if you aren't proficient in Python. This can be a nuisance or a learning opportunity, so it is up to you. In the final quiz, the questions which you can't just copy/look up answers to in the exercise have correct answers marked with an asterisk ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Coursera is usually better than this, so if this is your first course, don't give up.",0,1,Kat Red,53008208
