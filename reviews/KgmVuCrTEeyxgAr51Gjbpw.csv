16988301~COURSE!~KgmVuCrTEeyxgAr51Gjbpw,1640306872637,5,0,"Excellent course! Highly recommended. I took this course as part of the four course specialization. Professor Harvey does an excellent job explaining many nuances to DeFi. He uses a combination of powerpoint, visuals, analogies and case studies to make the content understandable. The professor teaches with clarity, and passion yet treats the subject fairly offering alternative points of view about the opportunities and risks of DeFi as compared to the current financial system. I have been introduced to the cryptocurrency and DeFi space a little over 6 months ago. Since that time, I have ""fallen down the rabbit hole"" so to speak and cannot learn enough about it. These courses provide a strong foundation to explore further for personal investing, and or a career in the space. Unlike the other courses I took on Coursera related to blockchain and cryptocurriencies (which were also pretty good), these courses felt much more up to date than the others. Being up to date in this space is essential because one year is like 10 years of another field in terms of innovation and how fast the landscape changes. Specific to this course, it was really helpful to understand the mechanics behind the different DeFi protocols to understand the potential benefits and risks to the average retail investor.
