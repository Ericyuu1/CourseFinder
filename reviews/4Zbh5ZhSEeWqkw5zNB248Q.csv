I don't think this class is well organized at all nor utilize the advantage of online platform. It is very un-interactive, one-directional explanation of the syntax and functions. So practicaly, you just take class explaning how to use code and take exam, nothing like interactive coding class. Further, you do not have good enough feedback why you got the wrong answer and how to impove  it.  You just try 2~4 times then you just pass. Also, the coding style is also very different from contemporary Python builds, I don't think the instructors understand people use f-string or list comprehension recently, they just use very old, classical way. I don't recommand this class if you are into bioinformatics, nor this class is really relevant what happesn in the informatics lab either. ",0,0,Randy Kang,13401182

After all these lessons, I obtained fundamental coding skills, and I also learnt how to use python for bioinformatics use. This course also provided me some chances to practice (I also realized learning to program is all about practicing and solving the bugs), otherwise, there is no way to pass the quiz and final exam. In my own opinions, the only thing that can be improved for this course is to have some post-quiz feedback sessions to explain the difficult questions in the quiz, because some of the questions are not fully covered in the lectures, even if I got it correct, I'm still not sure that my understanding is correct.
