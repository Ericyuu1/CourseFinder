102293460~COURSE!~rwkvqCB1EeymZwrrGHVoWw,1663714973950,4,0,I​t was a good introductory course to Python. Labs and assignments allow you to practice what is reviewed in the lessons but you will need outside assistance if you're new/novice to programming. I would still recommend this course for all beginners. Welcome to Python!,0,0,Matthew Cave,102293460
