50530983~COURSE!~MGhomNBjEeqIVg6qmDv0lw,1657659016159,1,0,"U​nfortunately, this course is the worst of the three. Despite it tackled important introductory skills, the tasks required after each topic are absolutely poorly designed. Instead of asking students to rewrite exact functions discussed in the course, the instructor should have put them in the materials for revision and studying and offered challenging cases instead without putting so explicit step-by-step directions. The final project script 3 is very confusing. I solved it in a much simpler dum way compared to the confusing directions given.",0,1,Bishoi Aziz,50530983

40139974~COURSE!~MGhomNBjEeqIVg6qmDv0lw,1651680167262,2,0,"I'm feeling bad for leaving a bad review because the subject of the course is really interesting and important.
But the course is delivered with such neglect and laziness that I have no choice.
I can't belive that in a signal processing course the lecturers didn't even bother to normalize the sound, it was terrible to
listen to the lecture and every time they played a guitar signal the volume just blown up and caused me momentarily deafness.
The whole course is passed via the command prompt with no command history view on, 
so if you want to see what were the commands just a few steps before thats too bad for you, you have to rewind it.
They didn't even bother to remove the typo mistakes they did, and no solutions to the exercises.
A big drop from the previous course in the specialization and I deserve more for my money.
Oh and YOU NEVER MAKE A 90 MINUTES video for one lecture. Split the video.

This is especially true during the on-screen demonstrations, where the instructor's voice is very low and grainy, sometimes interjected with very loud audio output from MATLAB, making me jolt and turn down my headphones.

The instructor answers questions, fixes potential problems in a timely manner.The videos are a mixed bag. It is obvious that the instructor took a long time/a lot of effort to make them. 1. they are way TOO LONG: 1h 30 minutes is not a good length for any instructional video. A good video is 15 to 20 minutes long. 2. In some of the videos, esp at the beginning, the instructor explains WHAT he is doing but not WHY. I would follow but not understand why I was doing what I was doing. 3. they are COMPLETE, i.e. if you listen, download and re-listen, you will get all you need. I highly recommend you download them and put your notes along side.  ",0,7,odile wolf,64731203

The videos are well set up, although pretty long at times. For each chapter there is a variety of quizzes and auto-graded assignments (the quizzes are mostly assignments as well which are to be solved with Matlab as a program or Matlab online). The guidance through these assignments is excellent, following the lectures and a little research outside makes them not too hard but still exciting. The same goes for the final project.
