I think the video case studies were particularly well made. The course is intended for people with a direct career interest in psychiatry/psychology (e.g.,  psychologist, students in a psychology bachelor), and includes assignments such as ""mental state examination"" , ""patient history"" (based on video case studies).  However, you can take it also if you simply have a keen interest in psychiatry and work in a completely different field. It does help though if you take a few beginner courses on psychology and psychiatry before taking this one.",0,1,Roxana Turturea,2383136
