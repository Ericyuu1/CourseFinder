It is a great affirmation that it is okay to make sacrifices in some parts of life when required, as long as they bring meaning to your overall vision of life. I enjoyed listening to the stories of these 6 exemplars and practicing some of the exercises to develop/strengthen each of the skills. However, I felt that the quizzes are not of much value as they purely focus on memory instead of practical application.
