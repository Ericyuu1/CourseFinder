This is not a course about the philosophies or ideas behind character design; it's a class meant for artists, and it demands that you create genuine, visual representations of characters from scratch. Not just simple characters, either, but characters of varying complexity, designs, and inspirations.

If people had to use at least 50 characters in order to submit their peer reviews then they would hopefully put some actual thought into their feedback instead of just saying ""nice"" over and over again.Aside from that, my only other issue is that some of the links for the guest artists don't seem to work anymore, and I think an update on where they are now/what they would have done different in their designs  today would be cool!

I think taking viewers through the creative process IRT is super interesting for people who want to be character designers themselves, and somewhat useful for their managers.  But I aspire at and am neither, and moreover, this is not a specialization in design and illustration - it is a specialization in videogame design and concept. A much more appropriate course would be rudimentary programming to make a simple game app. I enjoyed making the assignments and catching a nugget of useful info here and there. Even among the most useful concepts -  some were left to the viewer to decodify on their own, the designer didn't explain and the teacher  interviewer didn't pause the rambling to  clearly explain - eg, ""head's tall"", or ""shape language"".  Additionally - reviews were not useful at all, nothing specific. Also, one reviewer managed to fudge with the software somehow to replace 2 and 3 in the points system by respectively ""1.5 because of a tie"" and ""3.5 because of a tie"". What does that mean?!
