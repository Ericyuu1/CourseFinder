112620113~COURSE!~Gn2FwjeBEeSauSIAC0iVUQ,1660921922451,1,0,I am very excited about the topic and I can see that the instructor is passionate and knowledgeable about Neurobiology but unfortunately the course really suffers due to her difficulty with public speaking. I find it very distracting and difficult to follow when an instructor is unable to formulate a sentence coherently. She says in the beginning that the tests won't be overly difficult but they are extremely hard (the in video quizzes are okay) and I did not feel that the material on the test was covered adequately. I reccomend that you read one or more textbooks  on the subject before starting the course so that you do not become confused by the incoherent lectures.,0,1,Candice Daoud,112620113

76005941~COURSE!~Gn2FwjeBEeSauSIAC0iVUQ,1616310224834,3,0,"Dr Peggy was
incredible. Personable, funny, engaging, and easy-to-understand. Her love of
neurobiology was infectious, and it was a delight to be guided through the
subject material by her. I couldn’t have asked for a better teacher. My biggest gripe with
the course is that it is entirely too dense. Each week contained far more
information than, I think, should be packed into these short modules. By week
6, my interest levels were lagging behind my growing exhaustion. I just wanted
to be done with it - which I felt guilty about given, again, how great Dr Peggy
is and how keen I initially was. It might make more sense to split the course
into two: an introductory course that takes you through the basics, and a
second intermediate course that delves into the more complex topics which were
not adequately explored.Often, Dr Peggy would
mention something, a quick aside that seemed not-too-important, only for it to
show up in the final quiz. And on a handful of occasions quiz questions would
refer to material not covered in the class, altogether. Other times the anatomy
labs (which were optional to watch) would introduce new information, rather
than simply support the primary video teachings. Furthermore, as the weeks
progressed, quizzes became significantly harder to pass as no marks were given
for individual answers in “Check all that apply” questions. Finally, many of
the additional resources provided need to be updated either with working links,
or simply newer content.Overall, my experience
with the course was mostly pleasant, but I would think twice before
recommending it to others (especially if, like me, their last biology class was in high school). ",0,3,Hannah M,76005941

She has a great sense of humor and a very deep understanding that translates into practical descriptions that are relatively easy to understand. That said, this is not an easy course for laymen —I mean its neuroscience so I didn't expect it to be easy.My biggest beef was with the testing. On at least two occasions there were questions in the tests that covered information from topics we had yet to cover. While it has been many years since I have taken college-level tests, I found these test to be incongruent with the lectures. Sometimes it was the wording that caused a challenge; professor would use one term in lecture and a different term in the exam. Even with copious note taking (sometimes I would write down her words verbatim in my notes) I would still not always be able to answer questions correctly. Other times I found the critical thinking jump between what I learned and how to apply that knowledge to a problem presented on the test just too big. Again, I'm not a scientist, but still.

The vocabulary and content are made of many new terms for me that I have never heard and the level of research to understand them is a bit overwhelming.   I cannot get that understanding from the instructor.  Peggy is so enthusiastic in her lectures and clearly loves here topic, however, for me, she is extremely hard to understand.

I definitely have valued this course a lot and feel it has increased my thirst for medical and scientific knowledge in the future. However, I do think the course did not come without its faults. Firstly, I feel that the tests at the end of the week were VERY VAUGE and often didn’t use the best wording. I think that the fact that each question was only ever worth one point was rather unfair as if I had not gone just one tick box option right, but got the rest of the 5 options, it would give me 0 for this question. I think that this caused me to worry and stress that I was not smart enough to take the course, simply because of trivial testing. However, I am pleased that I was able to overcome this and realise that it just required extra focus and attention on all of the questions and perhaps I should have waited for all of the information to digest before taking the test every time. I thoroughly enjoyed the peer graded assessment on week 10 and feel that this should be incorporated right the way throughout the course, because it encourages other ways of learning and made me feel inspired and more motivated by the information present in each weekly session. 3 stars 🌟 ",0,5,Harry Clarke,58004702

It's very interesting to understand how everything works in us. For me it was a discovery of how complex and surprisingly subtle and well-thought-out system our nervous system is. How tightly everything in the body is interconnected. It's just amazing that a single cell can form such a complex structure. Now, with an idea of how everything works in us, I can better understand what is happening to me or my family at one time or another. Why there may be some problems and how to solve them. In short, if you imagine that our body is a complex and very intelligent machine, the course of neuroscience gives us explanations about its structure and management. Now, for example, when there is dizziness, I can understand why it originated. I can explain to my daughter why we don't forget how to walk or ride a bike, and many other things from our daily lives.

That way, as a student, we can follow along with the example rather than trying to navigate to points in the video where Prof Mason isn't obstructing the view of the board.

Peggy Mason has a rare gift to explain complicated things in easy and fun way. Learning with her is pure joy.   The course helped me to enjoy ordinary things of everyday life more and to understand myself and others better. For example, when I make a cup of tea and think ""I will take one cookie only"" I know that most probably it will not work. Once a ritual/an action starts, my basal ganglia will make sure it will last. It is popular now (especially among girls) to chastise oneself for bad eating habits. It is rather counterproductive. The role of volitional control of habits is overestimated and the role of basal ganglia is neglected.   Why giving this example? Well, everybody has bad habits. And everybody eats :) But don't get me wrong: this course gives insight in much more areas than habits formation and changing.  It is inspiring, very useful and applicable to everyday life.
