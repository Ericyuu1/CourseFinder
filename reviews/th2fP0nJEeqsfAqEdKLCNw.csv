5536417~COURSE!~th2fP0nJEeqsfAqEdKLCNw,1598232284514,4,0,"A strong ramp-up into the tasks that are common into machine learning NLP tasks. I really liked that we are taught to training a language classification model without deep learning: it works with less data and is more clear mathematically.There were more advanced things that I wanted out of this (e.g. of all the metrics to use, which best suits which task) but it was only a 1-2 hour thing.Well worth the time investment. I will be doing more of these guided projects.",0,0,Stephen Fox,5536417

I would have given a 5 star review but instructor used a lot of user defined functions which made it a little bit tough to follow. Overall the course was good concentrated on data imbalance, preprocessing strategies. ",0,0,Anantharaman K,37192217
