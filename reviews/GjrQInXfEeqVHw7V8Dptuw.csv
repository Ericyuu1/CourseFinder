74344702~COURSE!~GjrQInXfEeqVHw7V8Dptuw,1606383167582,3,0,"The course tries to cover a lot of material that is somewhat math-heavy.
 It's not easy to digest some of the concepts without some self-study 
using the book. Exercises and quizzes only cover a fraction of what is 
taught. An improvement could be to cover less topics and use the time 
gained to give some more examples and clarify some of the math.",0,4,Diego Gardini,74344702
3896768~COURSE!~GjrQInXfEeqVHw7V8Dptuw,1596960870729,3,0,"Need to use R or Python and freeware rather than courtesy access to JMP. I spent a lot of time fitting  R models to the data but it is a lot of work. Hence, I'm not going to complete the Experimental Design courses. The lecturer is very, very good and I enjoy listening to his wisdom.",0,2,Vytautas Duoba,3896768
44190328~COURSE!~GjrQInXfEeqVHw7V8Dptuw,1611266808267,4,0,"I have completed the specialization and the topic was new to me and I was interested to learn. However, the course discussion forum is not as practical and helpful as other courses that I have completed. There is no person in charge to provide any response and not enough knowledgeable learners around. So basically other than posting the final report, it has no use. One recommendation for improving the courses quality for better is to add to the JMP tool sections more and also the quiz and exams be more comprehensive and through to cover more.",0,3,Elham Lashkari,44190328
