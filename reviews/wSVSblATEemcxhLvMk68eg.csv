99762629~COURSE!~wSVSblATEemcxhLvMk68eg,1641764153131,2,0,"""It's not about the coding"" but the end project is difficult if you don't understand it, and not all things are so easy to find as it sounds. (ex. links don't work very well or easy in jsfiddle specifically) Also having a required peer review assignment at the end seems a bit ridiculous, this is a class where you work at your own pace and if you get done in a week with all of it and have no one to grade your assignment.... then you have to wait? Or the alternative and you're too late, and again, no one left to grade your assignment? At that point it seems like a waste of money and time. ",0,0,Grace Aitkens,99762629

84479961~COURSE!~wSVSblATEemcxhLvMk68eg,1622489257757,4,0,"Overall course is great. It teaches you the processes that need to happen before you even touch code that would make your code/product flourish. This helps me understand how to approach more situations as a designer, and how to streamline processes engineers, and stakeholders. The course outlined a shallow baseline of how to code in HTML and CSS. I assumed going into a course about coding there would be more emphasis on teaching students how to code, instead of the preliminary steps needed beforehand. As a note: some of the course should be reviewed as there are broken/expired links, and come course content that states “Coming soon”",0,0,Maggie Paquette,84479961

60993466~COURSE!~wSVSblATEemcxhLvMk68eg,1631559484731,5,0,A great first introduction to going from idea to code. Constant connection with a practical example definitely helped. Linking the coding to concepts in design gave a broader perspective.
