38093102~COURSE!~u4i-LFOFEe2-qxLbP0AeSQ,1672872138610,3,0,"Very interesting range of topics covered, thought some of it felt cut & pasted.  For example, Dr Morrow's lecture from Week 2 was repeated in Week 6 (with a different title).  It also looked like Week 4 used to be the big finish (thanks and handshakes with Hansen and Murphy).  Lots of typos.I'm glad I did it though",0,0,Stuart Newstead,38093102

Not that it was overwhelming to follow the proposed weeks, the course is well dimensioned. But it expands ones knowledge and understanding of the dimensions of the game, so it could be more than a game. A very nice experience form beginning till end.",0,0,João Antonio Ferreira Gusi,110430401
