Throughout the entire Statistics Certification (module 1, 2 and first 2 weeks of module 3) the difficulty is increasing at a slow pace and they make sure to present the knowledge at the same pace. For 3 and 4, they do not acknowledge at all that the difficulty of the topic just skyrocketed exponentially and they just do an expositional dump of 4 videos without any real-life example. What's even worse is that they send you on different websites to better understand - which you do - and than when you come back they teach you something completely new, without any connections. I just wasted a lot of time, and just skipped through all videos, and just trial&error the quizzes, skipped all the practice and assignments as they were imposibil to learn or even attempt.

Instead, you grasp some of the theoretical knowledge, but not of the underlying math and therefore none of the intuition. The same is true of Python, all that's required is to hit the run cell button, no actual coding is required.The lecturers are super enthusiastic though, and the final week was fantastic. Mark Kurzeja should have his own course on probability and Bayesian statistics.Week 3 of every course has been super dense, and I think T Brady West should have his own course on sample design and weights because right now his lecturers drag down the overall quality of the course. It's all slides and text, math is brushed over and not enough of it is applied. Honestly, if you wanted to really get into Multilevel & Marginal Models you'd need 4 weeks.My advice, take the AP statistics course on Khan academy, watch some STATSQUEST on youtube & perhaps take the intro to statistics offered by Stanford University.

1884246~COURSE!~ZMF2csDUEeiy_Ao4qYTCkA,1641611787304,5,0,"In this ""Fitting Statistical Models to Data with Python"" course, you will learn about
1. Variables, multicollinearity, study designs
2. Fitting statistical models to independent data - continuous (linear regression) and binary dependent variables (logistic regression)
3. Fitting statistical models to dependent data - Multi-level models (model fixed and random effects on the intercept and cluster terms) and Marginal models
4. Introduction to the Bayesian Statistics

The course covered lecture videos, well-prepared readings, Jupyter notebooks to introduce concepts as well as practice notebooks, lab walkthroughs and quizzes. Brady may speak alittle too fast, especially when it comes to long sentences, so you may need to rewind certain segments of the videos numerous times to revisit some concepts as you reflect and learn.

Discussion forums were also actively monitored by a TA who got back to me usually within a day, which helped to unblock conceptual roadblocks quickly.

You may encounter some issues with the Coursera platform:

1. Labs may fail to load at times, even after following instructions to restart the machine which your lab runs from

2. Your discussion forum comments may disappear right after you post. Remember to copy your comment somewhere else (e.g. on a notepad) as you may need to refresh the page and post your comment again.
