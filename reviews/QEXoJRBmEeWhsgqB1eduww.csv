60079956~COURSE!~QEXoJRBmEeWhsgqB1eduww,1595759045463,3,0,"I enrolled
in this course in the UK during the coronavirus pandemic. I watched all of the
video lectures, completed the quizzes, submitted my assignments and reviewed
the work of my peers. The only thing I did not do was submit my final exam (reasons
below).What’s great
about the course: There is a great deal of content that introduces lots of social
science concepts that affect happiness.  You
can delve deeper into those elements that interest you and have a base line knowledge
of those that don’t. Dr
Raghunathan is a great presenter with passion for his subject. The cheesy music
and jokes grew on me as I realised they were his authentic style.Some of the exercises were fun and introduced their
concepts in a gentle and thoughtful way.What could
be improved: The errors in the course are distracting and disappointing (I’m
talking about the ones that impact how the course works operationally (e.g. not
being about to upload assignments in a certain format when videos say that you
can do so, being told assignments have been submitted late when they have not,
being told you have answered questions in lectures wrong because you did not
use a capital letter) rather than typo errors or the wrong pictures being
referenced). I understand that there isn’t a commercial drive to correct these
errors in a free course, but we are six years on from when it was first created
and some of the main errors impact people’s enjoyment and progress, which in
turn will impact whether people will pay for a Certificate at the end (it did
me).Peer
reviews: while I completely understand that this course aims to be as inclusive
as possible, it lacks credibility for people to pass assignments when they don’t
understand the assignments, or have plainly put no work into them.  For example, one of the questions was “what
makes you happy?” To gain points one simply had to list a few examples of
things they personally did that made them happy, an answer presented to me just
said “lots of things” and nothing more, When I tried to award zero points, I encountered
error messages and could not submit my marking.The final exam: This comprises of 12 questions
in two parts (a) and (b) that covers all of the content of the course.The exam is a tall ask/order in terms of
requirements and content, particularly when you consider the lower level of
skill and knowledge students have needed to pass the assignments that have come
before it. I would suggest that the part (a) sections of the final exam were incorporated
into the weekly assignment tasks so we get accustomed to the rigour you’ll be
expecting at the final stage. Then the final exam should only be comprised of
the final six (part (b)) questions (and we were only required to pick three or
four of those to answer and submit). I suspect a lot of people, like me, quit the
course before submitting the final exam. I was all up for showing you what I
learned and what I committed to do to improve my happiness; the final exam
misses the mark in achieving that, which is a shame. ",0,0,Anne Langton,60079956

Some research conclusions also lack basic critical reasoning skills eg survey where people wished for 3 things and only 6% wished for happiness.

I love the way instructions are provided to submit the assignments. In other coursera courses I have mostly quit because of the lack of proper instructions during the assignments and also additional help. Not this one.

What I dont like is the pop up quiz. Its not that the quiz is bad but the pop up destroys the flow of the topic. You could have executed the quiz just like the polls where there is a pause by the Prof and then comes the quiz. It would ensure a coherence in the videos. 

But overall a great course.

If I am going to summarize, in one sentence, what this offering is all about, it would be this: “This a crash course on being a good person.” The course is packed with so much great content that I had no other choice but to save the lectures offline indefinitely. This will allow me to revisit the lectures from time to time as if they are parts of a pocket reference. Furthermore, it is delivered by someone most, if not all, people will listen to with respect: a business school professor with an engineering degree, an MBA and a PhD. If someone with such credentials, experience and expertise in an extremely competitive discipline believes in everything contained in the material, then I think everyone should really give some pause and consider what the course has to offer. For me, the most important component of the course is the comprehensive discussion on mindfulness. My only issue with the course is that some of the evidence presented felt either preliminary or too-much-leap. Nevertheless, one is unlikely to lose anything unfavorable and likely to gain something beneficial in heeding the prescriptions of the course. All in all, this course is highly recommended to everyone regardless of age, status in life, and experience.

Inviting many different scientists to the lecture made the lecture an essential milestone in this topic. The only negative feedback, I can contribute, is that sometimes the videos were a bit longer than required. Also, in the quizzes, it could be better to focus on the main ideas instead of the ""which benefits were not discussed in the x video, y research, z paper?"" type of questions. :)  It's not important to memorize which strategy belonging to which professor. The audience, as long as, they don't do academic career on this topic, doesn't need to memorize the scientist names, research names, but instead, some kind of case questions which could only measure if students absorb the main idea of each lecture would be better. :)",0,0,Güney Güvenç,51656758

Time flies and before u know it , u are already at week 6, than a dilemma comes to your mind : -What Happend ? - What is the purpose of this ? In a magical way the answer is there , from now on u can see life not only with your eyes , u are a more positive and optimistic person , u become again what u were from your birth , a human beeing. Of course its not a magical way , its the way which Professor Raj and his co-collaboratos , reveal u.

Please , enroll to this couse , u will become better person for yourselves, for the people u love and for the humanity.

Many thanks from Greece. Namaste !

Thank you professor Raj, I loved your style of presentation and also the passion with which you taught such a tough subject. Few Key Takeaways for me which I am implementing in my lifea. Labeling my emotion, whenever I am in a distressful situationb. Being a fly on the wall and just observing what is going on rather than jumping and reactingc. Practicing self-compassion rather than ruminating, doing an analysis of what went wrongd. Trying to control other people especially family memberse.

Being an educator, I find many of the modules very impressive and would really share it with my colleagues and students once life resumes to be normal. To maintain a repose and equanimous mind is really difficult during these unprecedented times. Confinement is a silent killer and it spreads its tentacles in a fast pace than expected.

Здесь я действительно контролировала сама себя и радовалась за сокурсников. Курс о счастье, о научно доказанных исследованиях и просто ощущениях как жить лучше. Не правильнее, а именно лучше для себя. Я рекомендую новым ученикам отнестись серьезно к занятиям, записывать все, обязательно дойти до конца. Курс запущен 2015 году и в Америке в школе MBA он признан лучшим курсом года. Все здесь становятся семьей, профессор даже отвечал мне на электронные письма :) .Это самая позитивная дисциплина о научном исследовании счастья, доказательствах, нейропластичности, привычках, ""грехах"" на пути к счастью. Это и жертвование своим счастьем ради чего-то другого (эффект ""золотой рыбки"", когда мы просим сразу что-то материальное, вместо просьбы быть счастливым), черезмерный контроль, недоверие к другим, потребность во внимании, в чувстве компетентности и мастерстве, погоня за превосходством над другими, недоверие к жизни (""стакан всегда наполовину пуст"") и игнорирование внутреннего источника счастья - осознанности. Начали мы с четкого определения счастья для себя и теста для замера уровня счастья. Конечно, оказалось потом, что мое определение описывает уровни демократичной свободы по философии. Учили и положительные стороны: эффективный альтруизм, практики умного доверия, создание ситуаций, в которых проще принять правильные решения, сосредоточенность, самосострадание.Наш профессор записывал интервью с кучей настоящих мастодонтов-профессоров исследователей психологии и эмоций людей. Это и создатель ""Потока"" Михай Чиксентмихай, и Ричард Девидсон (его книгу я сейчас и читаю) и Голдсмит. Последний сказал очень важную фразу в конце курса.""Почему мы не делаем что-то ради своего счастья? Я веду много тренингов для руководителей, через год кто-то из них придерживается полученных знаний и инструментов, а кто-то нет.И я понял, что нам часто мешает одна мысль. Всего одна. Вот она:""Сейчас я слишком занят"".",0,18,Galina Turchak,18912555

Very minor thing, but as the course was so good otherwise it stuck out to me.

Although at first glance, the content may seem theoretically heavy and dull, he teaches in an entertaining way without jargon, and with lots of anecdotes and metaphors, making it easy to follow, and most of all, fun to learn. I would definitely recommend this course for you!OVERVIEWEach module and the entirety of the course is structured very comprehensively. The lectures incorporate various professors who are experts in their field via video conference, telephone, and quotes. Lecture videos (though sometimes long) have lots of embedded quizzes and relevant external videos. Just like taking a course at university, supplemental (yet an optional) reading list is provided for those who wish to explore further. LECTURE VIDEOSProf Raj definitely knows what he is talking about and the videos are easy to follow. There are only a few videos where the audio isn't the best, but transcripts can be downloaded on Coursera, and a clean-format of the transcription can be found on the Facebook page. The animations, lighting, audio, in general are all great.THE COMMUNITY The discussion forum is very active. With at least three mentors active during the duration of the course, and at least one responding to a post within a business day, you won't feel like you're taking the course alone. CAUTION ! Although it states that time commitment is 2-3 hours a week, it will most likely take more than that. The total number of minutes spent on watching all lecture videos (for that week) averages to a little over 2 hours. If you're like me and want to take notes or take a break while studying or re-watch a lecture, you'll need more time. Plus on top of that, there are quizzes and assignments. (You can save time by not submitting assignments via the ISB website.)  I would allocate minimum 3 hours a week for this course and maximum 5. Bare this in mind for those who are working or studying full-time or are taking other MOOC courses.  - Enjoy the course! ",0,17,Mariko Morita,11168264
