Most of the ""most helpful"" reviews confirmed what I feared by following this 4th module to the end.I was really wary, having finished the third module pretty quickly, that the concepts in the lectures were simply become too broad and more about conceptual stuff and less about Python and learning to code. By the end of the Third module, you're basically just cutting and pasting pre-written code and making small tweaks to it. Not very helpful. The fourth module ""Using Databases"" starts out with a GREAT lecture about classes and Object-Oriented Programming, which IMO should have been the focus of the whole module. The lecture left me with the feeling that there was so much more to learn about OOP and got me excited to start doing coding again.However, it quickly segues into SQL and databases, which, OK, the SQL was interesting but the assignments once again started to be mostly cutting and pasting pre-written code. The first lecture on SQL was great, but I'm in the module to learn Python, not SQL. So you learn how to write SQL statements but the assignments are pre-written python programs where you tweak the SQL a bit... didn't really feel like I was learning anything new. I would have much rather done the SQL, then do a whole week on the conn.cursor and cur.execute stuff, learning how to actually write the python code. But there was a LOT of handwaving about this stuff. The last assignment is literally running prewritten code and taking a screenshot of the result. Not even tweaking it!  I mean-- how is that useful at all???All in all I am glad I took the first four courses of the Specialization. It gave me a great overview of Python, and showed me I have a little knack for it and want to pursue it further. But I was very disappointed in how the course wrapped up. And hearing the Capstone was more of the same stuff I was worried about, I'm bowing out of it. Anyway Dr. Chuck is great as a lecturer.

I decided after week 2 to use a different course to learn about Databases and Python.While I value the availability of this kind of courses for free, I just did not like the style of teaching of Mr Severance. I have a hard time watching 15+ minute videos after a full day of work already in front of the computer, when the teacher does not go straight to the point or make clear sentences (if a deaf person was reading the transcript, they would be struggling to follow). I am just not that interested in the history and how people did databases before etc., but I don't criticise that, some people might be interested. However I think that stretching a simple concept over more than 10 minutes is not helping students to grasp what is going on. On the other hand, I liked having cheap access to the book because it was faster to read about a subject than to sit for 15 minutes in front of the video, skipping ahead, trying to guess where the important bits are. Plus, running us through a code that the teacher doesn't write as he explains is not a good way to engage. As a student you think that you understand, but you'd be hard pressed to write that code if asked.So that's why I decide to go for a more interactive approach to learning, with lots of examples.",0,0,Audrey Dogbeh,41367221

If one wants to explain SQL one should start with the basics of the language from the very beginning and talk about each single command / word of the SQL language and how it is build. Learning or copying and pasting full commands will definitely not help. In addition, I expected to learn some basics of data visualization with certain libraries but in the end it was  (as always) nothing more than copy this prepared program and just change a few little easy things so that it works.

Programming exercises consist of running his poorly written code and posting results for peer review; students are instructed to grade leniently.  Overall, the presentation looks rushed and unpolished.  Example code looks like it was hobbled together until it worked and never edited for clarity.

To be honest, I think the instructor covers too much ground in too short a time for most students to gain a lot of understanding. Furthermore, the assignments are quite straightforward requiring minimal adaptation of the supplied code.The module on Object Orientated Programming is, frankly, a waste to time and a distraction. There are no practical exercises and the material is run through at a pace that makes it unlikely that anyone without prior knowledge would make any sense of it. What is more, there is no reference to, or use of, OOP at any other point in the course or specialization. The time would have been better spent in expanding the modules on the core topics of using databases with Python.On the positive side, the external tools on Dr Chuck's own website seem to work as expected and integrate smoothly with Coursera. The forums also remain supportive, although, as with most courses, far less active than on the old platform.I still rate this as a 4 star (albeit a 4-) as Dr Chuck is such an engaging instructor and there is still a good progression through the specialization.

1884246~COURSE!~eQJvsjn9EeWJaxK5AT4frw,1636937566675,5,0,"This course was a good introduction to the concept of:
-'Objects', classes, methods in Python
-SQLite
-Refresher of basic SQL statements, JOINs, WHERE clause, ORDER BY, LIMIT
-Basics of a good data model in a relational database, multi-table relations,
-One to one, one to many and many-to-many relationships
-Working with the instructor's 'Twitter' API
-The end-to-end geocoding process using Google Maps, from
>getting a set of locations to
>constructing the URL string,
>querying the URL,
>retrieving results in JSON,
>loading geocoding results into the SQLite database,
>retrieving the geocoding dataset for visualising on a web page using Google Maps

For almost every assignment, the instructor put in effort to provide a primer/base python script for you to analyse and validate your understanding. From there, you will work to understand what the actual assignment wants you to do and work on your coding assignment.

Overall, this course struck a good balance between being too easy (and not having any coding exercises at all) and being too challenging (where some courses do not provide any primer material at all, leaving learners to struggle).

For learners with some background in SQL, you will come out of this course having more confidence in working with objects, classes, methods and the end-to-end geocoding process. Just put in the effort and work your way through the content!Helpful",0,1,Kaiquan Mah,1884246

Before my enrollment, I was deeply impressed by the fact that you're so courteous and generous to allow everybody to use your precious teaching materials (books, slides, videos, etc.) for no charge. I thought to myself, ""Not so many people do this these days, who is this guy??"". After watching the first video, I could not stop ever since. Your presentations are outstanding and quite engaging. Your sense of humor is amazing. The effort that you put into your slides never went unnoticed. The writing style of your Python book is very nice. Everything you say or write shows how passionate you are about your work. But, what is even more impressing is the amount of time and effort that you give for no charge to help others. Obviously, you could have made thousands of dollars if you used your time and efforts otherwise, but, fortunately, you chose another route, which, in fact, pays off in the long run. Probably, you did not get as much money as you deserve, but you helped many thousands of people who needed help and made them so much grateful to you.

Now I'm working on an independent project and using the knowledge in this class to connect to databases with APIs, decode the information using a JSON library within python, and process the data to solve real world problems.    The free online book is a great start to each week of learning. If you first study the book and practice with the sample code in each chapter with your Atom program, you will do well.  The lecture videos are solid and helpful, reinforcing the book material.  The assignments are fair and sometimes a little too easy but for this 5 course beginner sequence, overall I believe they're right on the money.  A huge thanks to Dr. Chuck and everyone involved in putting this course (and all 5 in this sequence) together!  I'm looking forward to the capstone (5th course) in a few days.  ",0,1,Jason J,767648

He puts presents every topic in such a way that you're never scared off thinking ""i'll never understand this stuff.""  He make computers and everything technical make sense.  I've basically binge-watched almost every lecture/course he's headed up.  I never knew how vital it was to understand Database development.  I also thought it would be outside of my realm of knowledge but now all i want to do is build databases to analyse.  He makes it so easy to comprehend.  I always thought i was Python was for wanna-be programmers but now i'm proud to say Python is my language of choice.  SQL scared the hell out of me before i took this course.  Now it's my first stop when i'm planning to develop a new model.He makes learning fun and seems like he's be a really fun guy to get to hang with.

This is true particularly because he is so passionate about the subject and skilled in both the craft as well as helping others to learn it. For me, learning databases has been a very fun and liberating study. I needed it. I have been planning my own version of a personal finance application with all of the features and customization that I want in it for some time now. Learning databases was and is an important step in reaching the knowledge level that I think I need to attempt my project with some probability of success and happiness with the end product. I have done some event-driven programming in Python, and have messed around in someone else's GUI in that class, but designing and implementing my own GUI won't be easy. Thanks to Dr. Chuck's class series, however, I feel much more confident that I can go out there and review the different third party GUI libraries and see if any will get the job done for now. Alternatively, the University where Dr. Chuck teaches also has a web design certificate that seems like it might be useful. If GUI programming is too hard I might go with a web version since I have heard that Javascript, particularly jquery and D3 would make my task of graphing and presenting financial data quite doable.",0,1,David White,1871435
