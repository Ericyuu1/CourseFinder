Further, my connection to the site is disturbing.  In this and a couple of other courses, the video lectures jump around and begin in the middle of the lecture.  Between these two issues, I am not having a good experience with this course.   I live in the US and have graduate degrees in public health .  ",0,0,Annabella Roig,520547
