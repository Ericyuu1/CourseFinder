10930317~COURSE!~aTAS-e7eEeqUOwrOEtOsCQ,1673419281080,5,0,"The Course Material was factual, interesting , thought provoking and so beautifully presented that I was sad that it had to come to the end. I loved the sequence of the modules .I settled in nicely with the astronomy that was familiar to me and building up from there was the most incredible experience.  Up until now 've had a very compartementalized idea of the history and philosophy of astronomy.At first I was apprehensive of the peer assignments but what a wonderful way to experience the different thoughts, opinions and writing styles of my peers, from whom I could learn much.  I now have a whole new perspective of the universe (and maybe other universes as well!) Thank you so much for the opportunity.",0,0,Carol Botha,10930317
