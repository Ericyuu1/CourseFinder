One of the non-defined pulse points (pedal) is then on the Week 6 quiz with no explanaion for why it is in the quiz that has nothing to do with pedal pulses and was never defined in the first place.  Also, the Clinical Terminology Dictionary for this class was missing several words and definitions that certain weeks tell you specifically to look up!

There are also good resources that can be referenced in future.   I took off one star because there were a few glitches in the course such as broken links or typos which have apparently not been addressed by staff.
