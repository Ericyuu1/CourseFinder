20625727~COURSE!~_u6gQDK6EeycGBKEuRb8CQ,1676449446227,3,0,"Good complementary  course to the Multivariate Calculus course by Imperial College London. I had already taken that course so I was able to skip almost all the lectures here, and jumped straight to the assignments. Week 3 Newton's methods contained the use of Hessian instead of gradient descent, which was covered the the ICL course, but was not explained where it came from. They also used the hybrid of Hessian and Grad Descent and the use cases for both. Overall, if you are stuck between this course or the ICL version, go with the ICL one ",0,3,Saurabh Kumar Singh,20625727

117337123~COURSE!~_u6gQDK6EeycGBKEuRb8CQ,1675788349764,5,0,"I also did the calculus course of imperial college london (didn't finish the last two weeks because the course gets worse after week 4) and I have to say that I enjoyed this course much more. Things are explained very clearly and I built a very good understanding and intuition of all the concepts. One could argue that the topics covered are a bit too basic, but in the end you get a good understanding of how optimization algorithms like gradient descent are working under the hood of ml-models.",0,1,Max Moser,117337123
8677801~COURSE!~_u6gQDK6EeycGBKEuRb8CQ,1675460441765,5,0,"Great Course! Here I find a lot of step-by-step explanations of how mathematical neural network works. A lot of examples and visualizations(a lot of animation, that can be used, as an experiment) provide a high understanding of what we using, why we using that in a certain situation, and how we can use it in practice programming neural networks. Highly Recommend!",0,2,Diana Kapralova,8677801
