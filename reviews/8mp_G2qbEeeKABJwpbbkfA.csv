9447702~COURSE!~8mp_G2qbEeeKABJwpbbkfA,1676503870697,2,0,"I noticed that not a single person mentioned how poorly this course was written. There are numerous typos throughout the course: spelling mistakes, grammar mistakes, poor sentence structure, and so on. A few of the quizzes even have incorrect answers. I looked up Dr. Chow and I see that he earned his PhD way back in 1985 at the University of Texas, so why is his English still so poor? I mean no disrespect, but by now one would think that his English would be almost perfect. Even stating that, why didn't he have anyone proofread his writing and fix it? However, if someone else wrote the course, then why did he allow so many errors in the course? It's just mind-boggling. I'm here to learn, not to decipher broken English. I could understand if this course were from another country, but it's from the University of Colorado system, so the course should have been much better written. Anyway, I gave the course two stars, since despite the poor writing, there is useful information in it, otherwise it would be a one star class to me for sure.",0,0,Dan Tinsley,9447702

It is a very interesting course. Although most of the materials are quite old, surprisingly, they are still valid. The information is practical and detailed. You can check the Linux commands yourself.
