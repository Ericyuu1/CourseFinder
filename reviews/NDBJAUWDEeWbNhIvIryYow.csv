However and most of all, you can sense that this is more of an advertising campaign for AXA IM than an investment course per se... During the 4 modules, you're basically repeated over and over again that Active Management (ie. Investment Managers) tend to overperform and that you should have one manager. There's even the overall 1st part of Module 4 that is dedicated on how to select a manager... There are some great insight related to portfolio allocation but not much explanations. A major point that I would have liked to hear about is how to come up with the risk aversion criteria... Many parts of the course relate to external videos available on Youtube. If you're going to advertise on such a platform as Coursera please don't make it too much about the advertising and more about learning...

My critics are constructive. Personally, I am a doctor in business administration and I have two masters, one in banking & finance and another one in accounting and tax and I completed this training with honors. The content of this course is fairly good. The issue, is that the contribution of the academic participant is not that great, he provide formulas with poor explanation of the parameters and the overall objective or the different use of the formulas. For example in module 4 he does not explain what does mean regression and the objective of regression in using multiple factors. On the other hand the contribution of the professionals from AXA I.M. is great. This training has some errors in some answers but are not significant at all.I recommend this training if you are average and above in mathematics (it is not difficult). You have to understand certain used metrics in statistics such as variance, covariance, correlation etc.The advantage of this training: you will understand all the details related to investment management, starting from the objectives of different types of investors, passing by the different asset classes and the risks impacting the asset allocation for optimised portfolio, until explaining the techniques or criteria used to select a fund manager.Overall, I recommend this course.",0,2,BECHIKH NAOUFEL,56923538

4800535~COURSE!~NDBJAUWDEeWbNhIvIryYow,1478787579124,3,0,"The course topics are great and I have to admit that I learned a lot during this course.  The provided materials are good, but in my opinion sometimes not enough to be able to answer some of the questions in the tests.  I had to spend some time researching the web to work out some of the problems.  This per se is definitely not bad (it rather resembles real life), but all the other courses I have taken on Coursera and other platforms provide enough material and/or explanations to be able to work out all the problems without needing to look it up somewhere else.  The problem-solving issue also has to do, to a certain extent, with the formulation both of some questions and answers, which in some cases can be understood in different ways because a key word is missing or is wrong, usually prepositions.  I am aware of the fact that the course creators are not native English speakers, but, when formulating questions and answers, they should take the time to check their formulations for grammar and correctness (I am sure there would be no mistakes if the course were in French :) ).  I posted a couple of questions on the forums and, sadly, never received an answer.  Neither from fellow students, nor from the course moderators.  Certainly the fellow students do not have any obligation to reply to questions, and I usually would say the course moderators don't either.  But I am paying for this certificate and I therefore expect some kind of support.  I am sure the course moderators are very busy and do not have time to be browsing around the question forums every day, but so am I.  And taking a look in the forums once a week or so wouldn't hurt.  Let me also point out, that the 2 questions I posted are THE ONLY questions in the forums, so it's not as if the moderators would be overwhelmed by the amount of questions posted.  After my second question, I knew I was all by myself.  From other courses I know that course moderators chime in once in a while on questions that have not been answered by fellow students and when no fellow student seems to be able to find or provide a correct answer.The course is good, and you will learn a lot.  If it weren't for the lack of support in the forums, I would give it 4 or maybe even 5 stars, depending on the responses I would receive.Either way, enjoy the course!!
