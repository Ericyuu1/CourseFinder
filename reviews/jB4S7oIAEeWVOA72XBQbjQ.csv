67176941~COURSE!~jB4S7oIAEeWVOA72XBQbjQ,1596555547121,1,0,"I only got into the second week, and I decided to drop this course. I did not wish to devote any more time to it.I was hoping to hear some good stories of the history of science. And I was looking for some understandable explanations of complicated material, but I was disappointed in several ways.The explanations were sometimes clear and sometimes not. The illustrations were not particularly good and vastly too complex for me to follow. They were mostly pulled from textbooks and papers and were not adapted specifically to the online environment. It seemed like they were not used because they were good examples for teaching, but because they were readily available.The transcription was autogenerated by a transcribing engine and had many mistakes and misspellings, including the names of the scientists, proteins and enzymes. No one had taken the time to read the transcription and make the needed corrections.The technical aspects of the course...the audio quality and the video quality...were good.I still like the topic and the idea of using this topic in a Coursera course. But the execution of the teaching was not good enough to warrant spending much time on this.",0,0,Michael Hughey,67176941
