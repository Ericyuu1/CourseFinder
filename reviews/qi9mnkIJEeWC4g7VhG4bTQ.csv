110560663~COURSE!~qi9mnkIJEeWC4g7VhG4bTQ,1671139707113,1,0,"I am so disappointed with this class. I really looked forward to a case study approach that was hands-on. But the instructors have left UWashington (they are both at Stanford now), the full curriculum was never completed, and  nobody has updated the class despite the software being radically updated and rearranged after lectures were filmed. Hence, while the teaching is pretty clear, there is no way for the student to follow along on his/her own. UWashington tried to update the Jupyter Notebook pages to try to show how things work with the new software, but those updates were  inadequate to enable a student to pass the quizzes. I was never able to get past quiz 3, and had to guess at some of the questions in quiz 2 because the software was not able to provide the information needed to answer quiz questions. Further, if you are using a Windows machine, the software doesn't work, unless you run Linux in a Docker app or run it in WSL. There, of course, is absolutely NO help from the instruction material on how to do this, and only by digging in the forums can one get some ideas about how to get it working. THIS IS REALLY UNACCEPTABLE for a course from a reputable university that I'm paying for.DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE!The course desperately needs to be filmed again and instructions updated. The lectures are great, but the video part of actually building software to do what the lectures teach is in desperate need of updating to match the current state of the software.And in case you think that this review is coming from someone who doesn't have a clue...I am a retired programmer, having worked on advanced simulation and AI software for R&D groups in both Lockheed Martin and IBM for  40 years. I know my way around Macs, Windows, and Linux OSs. While my python skills are not to the level of my C and C++ skills, I have been actively writing python code for the past 6 months.

Unfortunately that photo was no longer in the dataset so I did the code just to learn it, then I had to eyeball guess which of the quiz options matched their cat photo the most closely. In the fourth quiz we were expected to do coding that was never presented in lecture, and the documentation they linked to was bad. With regular python documentation I'm able to learn how to code in new ways because they give examples. Not so with the turicreate documentation. Another issue was that in one of the quizzes they threw in the vaguery of normalizing to either 0 or 1 in a neural net logic gate question. I found two correct answers where one normalized to 0 and the other to 1 yet was still marked incorrect. Online courses will eventually replace in-person classes but not when they're so filled with errors and students are unable to clarify these errors with faculty.

As noted by others, this is not a course for learning so much as an advertisement for the instructor's own pay software and their other Coursera courses.  I'm not against that per say if it was entirely free, but charging for an advertisement is ridiculous.  In my case I thankfully started with the free model so I didn't lose out, but I could see others being dissapointed.  I strongly recommend starting the material with a free signup and only pay if you really want the extra grading.My other main problem was with the pace and detail in the course.  I would have liked more detail, but I recognize this was intended to be a high level view so I'll live with that level of detail.

I liked the fact that the course covered a wide range of problems quickly. There were however two issues that I did not like.
1)	It is not well supported and given that the technology is proprietary, there are few other places that offer support (i.e. you can’t just look at problems and solutions on stackoverflow to get insight into the tech)
2)	For a course labelled as “intermediate”, it presented very little detail. Most of the course was dedicated to explaining particular problems, the solution to which was inevitably “then you train this really clever, one-line algorithm we have written for you and you query it for insights”. I felt a little cheated by this approach to a subject which should be really fascinating. 
While some of my concerns may be addressed in follow on courses, I am left with little insight into what really lies ahead. For example, is this really an “intermediate” course? What background do I really need? Will we ever get to the detail or will I always just be expected to call someone else’s brilliant algorithm and accept the result.

The introductory course provided a nice overview of key machine learning techniques in the context of common applications of machine learning (case studies).  The concepts are taught in Python using the high-level DATO GraphLab libraries,  so the course provides a good introduction to using the machine learning techniques that are provided in DATA GraphLab rather than on learning the mathematics behind the techniques.  I am investigating the capabilities and advantages and disadvantages of existing frameworks such as Pandas and DATO GraphLab, so this course met my needs, but it would probably not be as useful to data scientists who are interested in learning the underlying principles, mathematics and numerical methods used in machine learning.  I would have given the course a rating of five IF it had done a better job of describing the fundamental principles of machine learning and if it had made it easier to use a non-commercial framework such as Pandas.  I'm planning to take the next course in the series in the hope that it will provide more in-depth coverage of the fundamental principles of machine learning than the introductory course.",0,0,Daniel Valentino,5365387

The instruction is clear and the homeworks are always interesting and well thought out.I really only have one complaint: Graphlab. Graphlab is a fantastic piece of software that makes data science easy. I was amazed at how much harder it was for me to complete the home works with scikit and pandas. Unfortunately, it's very unlikely that any future employer will be using Graphlab. It's a great intro for noobs (like me), but it's very expensive and can be replicated with open source packages. As such, I had to spend a lot of time trying to figure out on my own how to perform graph lab operations in the open source world. Avoiding this kind of slow, frustrating, stack exchange binging, 50 tab opening, nonsense is one of reasons I take MOOCs in the first place. I hope a future version sets up the bones of what open source packages can be used to solve each problem set. In summary, I really enjoyed this class. I was excited to work on it. I learned things that made me more productive at work. I felt the joy of learning. I was disappointed by the insistence on Graphlab but if making the sales case for it is what motivated Carlos and Emily to put the class together, it's worth the frustration.

A plenty of research has been undertaken to make machines intelligent. Learning is a natural human behavior which has been made an essential aspect of the machines as well. There are various techniques devised for the same. Traditional machine learning algorithms have been applied in many application areas. Researchers have put many efforts to improve the accuracy of that machinelearning algorithms. Another dimension was given thought which leads to deep learning concept. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. So far few applications of deep learning have been explored.

Modules are centered around a Real world problem that is easy to relate to such as product recommendations on a website or analysing text. While other courses dive straight into calculus and theory where it's hard to recall the actual problem being discussed, this course doesn't have any those issues. It is very well structured and gradually progresses while providing real learning along the way.The assessments are just the right length and offer a suitable challenge without expecting hours of work for each question.A large benefit of this course is the environment setup is straightforward. I had my jupyter notebook running in a few minutes. With other courses, I was spending hours trying to install things before trying to learning anything but with this course I was up and running quickly",0,0,Paddy,75471638

Becoming more familiar with Jupyter has also been a bonus. One thing that I was not as familiar with was SFrames and the use of dictionaries within Python. I have mainly used Python for numerical linear algrebra, image processing, signal processing, and the like. Links to good tutorials for SFrames would be helpful. As an introductory course, it focuses more on applying techniques rather than specific details related to the techniques.

Word of caution : Course lecture videos uses  the Graphlab. Course jupyter notebooks have the up-to-date Turicreaatecode. You can also use Panda/Numpty/Matplotlib to arrive to same conclusion. However I am new to ML/Python so stuck to course guided notebooks. it worked for me.Course first gives you an intuitive and solid theory background  and then walks you through how to implement that into Graphlab/turicreate.  Best part is Quiz / Assignment. You are not just copy pasting code from the class but really challenged to find a solution using turicreate API .Overall good start.

However, I was pleasantly surprised with the content and delivery - Carlos' and Emily's adorably dorky banter and their clear and concise approach to the various case studies made it easy for me to grasp the fundamentals of Machine Learning. Their delivery of the course's content is beyond reproach. (Although I would have loved to see Carlos going on a little more about Messi and soccer in general!). I struggled a little on the last question of the final assignment (Week 6), but besides that, it was smooth sailing.

This course provides that applied approach to implementing a broad range of machine learning applications with Python, applied to real problems.A course this small cannot provide everything - what this course does not provide is in-depth technical tutorials on the workings of machine learning algorithms. There are many courses out there which do, but this course to great for learning a practical approach to problem solving with machine learning and data processing.If there is a downside, I would say that the use of paid packages in the lectures (graphlab) limits the student's ability to learn Python using the freely available packages on the web, which was my personal preference. However, this is not purely negative, since there are many employers out there who would like to know that you have practical knowledge of things like AWS and graphlab.

I think I've watched every week's videos and completed assignments within about 2-4 hours. The only suggestion I would have (and it is a very personal opinion)  is to spend less time on illustrating slightly irrelevant aspects of the material, such as showing quite a few Amazon products or going through a full shoe collection. I can see how that can make the course a little more lively but for a person who treasures every minute of their free time, it can be noticeable, especially when it takes a significant fraction of the very well-sized small videos.

They lean heavily towards Dato which is not open source - using a 1 year trial license.  However there are better instructions and support for open source in subsequent courses.  Also - the second course in the series which I'm taking now is taking what we did in course 1 and diving into the math and algorithms involved - walking through actual proofs etc.  It doesn't require you to know them well enough to do on your own, but they do walk you through them and explain extremely well - you actually implement the resulting algorithms.

14533823~COURSE!~qi9mnkIJEeWC4g7VhG4bTQ,1452357636093,5,0,"Excellent overview course. It has exactly the right balance between explaining Machine Learning concepts, and providing enough supporting mathematics & logic to understand why these concepts are correct (without going through epsilon-delta proofs). Having followed several Machine Learning courses, this is now definitely my favourite new course, replacing Andrew Ng's famous course here on Coursera (which was also very good & especially complete, but required too often a leap of faith - this course provides really more details on the ""why""). Furthermore, the exercises in this course are spot-on: they use Python and GraphLab Create (for which you get a 1 year student license when taking this course) - the big advantage is that you can focus on the Machine Learning aspect, and not on how to implement something in Python (or Matlab or R). The exercises are challenging enough and require some thought, exactly what they should do. This is not a ""look up the right answer in the slides"" course when it comes to exercises, which I particularly like. The chemistry between the teachers is also very nice and shows they just love Machine Learning, and love teaching it (which they do very well).
