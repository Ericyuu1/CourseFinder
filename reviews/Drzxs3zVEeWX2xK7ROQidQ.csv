The lack of both meant that I sometimes used the videos to put me to sleep...Another issue - for which I bear significant responsibility - is that I expected the course to spend a lot more time on the human dimension of the Arctic.

Anyone can learn how to do this course. Although the questions in the last quiz in module for more marked wrong even though most of them would be right. The only two things you need to know about the Arctic it's  freezing and miserable, and also you don't need a course like this to know about climate change.

Problems: the presenter is HORRIBLE.  He's sing-songy, trying to be interesting.  Can't you get the dino guy?  Or me -I'll do it for free.  PAINFUL.  Also - you need more graphics.  Charging along with Mr. Boring and a map of Alaska behind him as concept after concept - difficult ones for folks who aren't like me with lots of background - is a perfect recipe for lack of comprehension. Even inept and cheesy graphics would be better than nothing. Yes, I noticed that the earth is spinning the wrong way in the ""sun at an angle around the sun"" graphic but who cares?  It's something.  And yes, I know it's free, and I know you have budgets, but 3 universities can't rustle up a graphics undergrad to help out and call it an internship??

I never got a response for my question posted there and I saw that there are many more unanswered questions. The lectures really need more figures, schemes, maps and so on. When a lector is mentioning some toponyms I'd love to look at a map at the same time. It is hard to understand just while listening how the steams go, for example. Similarly, when a term is introduced it should be written on the screen for longer than 3 seconds and be accompanied with an illustration. There were a lot of new words for me and I can't say that I understand all this ice-terminology even after finishing the course.There were illustrations, animations and maps in video lectures, just in my opinion far not enough. Instead, I could enjoy beautiful photographs of Arctic landscapes. The photos were indeed amazing =)The material is interesting and wholesome. The chapters are well-connected to each other and it feels like the basic knowledge on the subject is covered very well.What I liked the most were the questions appearing inside the video lectures.

The script was great - very insightful and informative, but having the presenter talk for the whole lecture without more frequent use of diagrams, figures, etc. to help understand the concepts is not helpful and incomprehensible to me. Specially when it comes to a course with so much geographical content, it would be good to have a more consistent depiction of maps. Furthermore, with all the new concepts, visual aid would help students understand what things are and what they look like since the backgrounds chosen for the lectures have little or nothing to do with the course whatsoever.On the other hand, I do think that the questions throughout the videos are extremely useful as they (usually) tackle problems that were not mentioned previously and gets the student to think independently.
