I have loved Professor Roth's passionate lectures and entertaining delivery; his concepts of the ""really real"" and the lens of his space-time glasses; loved the wide-ranging reading and being introduced to new writers; and also loved the way that the different strands were combined at the end of the course, through the contemporary thinkers and concepts and the eclectic and positive messages for the future ending with Appiah's ""happy globalism"".
