As well as talking through the important issues in experimental design that provide the potential for valid statistical solutions, the course provides links to a range of on-line tools to help. The sections on philosophy of science also help in this respect as they shed a light on the kinds of questions experimenters ask.",0,0,Lee Vousden,5924085

The only problem is some modules are similar to previous MOOC but slightly different, and sometimes it is confussing. Daniel Lakens is the best teacher of statistics I have ever met.

One of the most important abilities for the scientific work is to be able to produce relevant, or at least informative studies; that's the whole point of science, and it's very sad that most of us (researchers) don't fully understand how to correctly assess/conduct research, and the importance of it. This course will definitely help you realize and construct the statistical thinking necessary to improve scientific practices.",0,3,Nora Patricia Hernández López,5595501

The reading and lectures inspired me to read more and clarified questions that have long been on the edges of my understanding of science.The home works were a little rote but I think that helps make the calculations clearly within our grasps. The only frustrating thing was the course depends on a handful of libraries which were tough for me to install. I eye-balled some graphs that were included with the home works and had a to think a bit more about some questions that were generally ""change x to y and rerun, what is the value of z?""",0,0,Alex Riina,6798238
