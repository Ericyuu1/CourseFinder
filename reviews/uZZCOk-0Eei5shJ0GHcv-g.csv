But, if you just want to learn new concepts in data science and do not need a certificate, I recommend you to take other courses other than IBM. There are very good courses on @linkedin Learning. In this program, IBM pushes you to work only on its platforms which is really annoying and I think this a considerable drawback of this program. If you spend at least 4-5 hours a day, you'll be able to complete it in 2 months. The subscription is monthly and it's around $50 CAD and you can unsubscribe whenever you want.

The course was intended in my view as a recollection of the material and practices taught in the course all rolled into a nano project.In my view the topic and objectives for  this course were very loose but the main focus assumes to be foursquare API's which were not mentioned  until this course. The topics were loose which meant issues encountered in data collection via scraping or visualization might not have been covered within the course.For me it was a learning experience but I am not sure about the value of the certificate offered by IBM. For starters the grading is peer reviewed which of course means the grade are not quality controlled but a reflection of your peers grading abilities  regardless  of whether they would like to shoulder those responsibilities.There is no proctor administered  for graded examination or  office spaces for internship like experience  and assumes some higher power is reviewing  your honor code  and motivation.As far my application with this certificate has not given me a technical advantage even within IBM and I am not sure if the third party career counseling offered via Coursera have a success story.I enjoyed the course even though the course and its material  very rough and marketing oriented. The course was supposed to provide me with a practical advantage in the area of Data Science as a new entrant  and I have not observed any advantages so far with my applications on linked in.  ,0,31,Narsi Sarathy,32695513

After joining the course, I was able to further think and ask at work how data collection would affect our product and indicate how the envisioned data may provide misleading information. However, the courses' duration is much longer than indicated on Coursera and apart from the time spent on completing the course contents, I have spent a lot of time trying to get Watson Studio or the hands-on lab operational, and the hands-on lab could be down for a week or more. From my perspective, this is counterintuitive and inefficient, and I did not expect this from IBM's products. 
Looking at some of the reviews for this course, I think it is fair to warn others who are looking to join that the courses are generic and some - if not most of the - time requires the learner to Google answers for any confusion and code tutorial or read books; this does not bother me as it has been my approach for a long time.
 
As I am writing this review I am awaiting my classmate to review my peer assignment for the second time because I got less than the required pass grade, which perhaps my classmates may have experienced once or twice throughout these ten courses due to incorrectly marked assignments. Although I admit I did not perfectly complete the capstone project's slides, based on the guide I would have received a higher score than what I had; for example, I got zero points instead of two points for having my GitHub link and PDF file attached. However, I understand the importance of reading your peer's assignments because some of the assignments I read inspired me, but the peer-review system is flawed because the course expects a constant number of students studying at the same period and the minimum number of assignments required the students to review would cover the whole cohort for that period; evidently, sometimes this system does not operate as expected because there are usually threads asking for help to review the assignment on the week's discussion forum.
Consequently, from my perspective, this course would be more efficient if an automated correction system was also available, similar to ""Machine Learning by Andrew Ng"".  ",0,2,Song Nga Wong,57533296

The video contents and the practice exercises are very good and on point. Instructors are great. However, there are serious problems with the assessment mechanism and this is the reason why I am giving a 4 start.If you work hard on the assignments, meaning that you study and research well to understand the code, you might end up getting a low score on assignments. This is because of peer-graded assignments. Your work might be graded by someone who doesn't understand the material as much as you do, or even someone who submitted a blank file just to see others' work. You rarely get feedback for the missing marks. As a simple example, I once submitted my work and received 4/11 with no feedback. I instantly re-submitted the same work and received 9/11 from another peer. Another problem is that you get to see the rubric only after you submit. Some assignments are not clear on what the specific expectations are. The rubric must be clear before you submit the work. Even if you try to be flexible in your solution to address the vagueness, the peers may not show the same flexibility although you do the work properly.And finally, the biggest issue.. Plagiarism! When I say plagiarism here, I mean copying someone else's work line by line all the way. It is utterly disgusting that it is more widespread than I initially thought. Such cases have been posted multiple times in the forum. I encountered at least 2 cases of plagiarism. The only thing you can do is to flag the submission, but obviously this doesn't stop anyone. What's worse is that those people who plagiarised someone else's work line by line get to peer-grade your own work.  Assessment section of these courses is a mess and has to be seriously re-evaluated. Peer graded assignments can be accepted to a certain extend but not for assignments that require hours and hours of our effort.",0,3,Ozgur Unal,23292301

Overall speaking, the specialization is good and fairly easy (especially the first two courses). In terms of the Capstone Course, it looks intimidating but it won't be a big problem if you follow the materials closely. The final project is a great opportunity to be creative and to utilize all kinds of sources (and get to know the city you are interested in better). Nevertheless, I think the specialization should include more coding exercises/assignments instead of simple quizzes at the beginning. More hands-on exercises should be added to the introductory courses. Personally speaking, I'd like to get trained more on data cleaning and writing loops/functions.",0,6,Chutian Zhou,28596865

First, you learn how to scrape data and use the Foursquare API, which is quite helpful as these skills are generally transferrable. Then you'll need to come up with an idea that is loosely related to location data in some way. You'll have several weeks to implement your idea and write a report and a blog post/presentation. The final project is a lot of work.In my opinion, the grading system could be better. You rely on peer reviews to pass the course, but only one peer looks at your work. Multiple sets of eyes would be fairer and hopefully generate more feedback. The discussion forum aspect could also be improved to promote collaboration and not simply requests to ""please review my submission"". All in all, a decent guided Capstone course.

But after really biting into it, I realized the content makes sense: it allowed me to put to the test what I learned on the course. Being constrained to use the Foursquare API on the capstone feels a bit odd, but at the end using an API to get information works really well. I tried scrapping the information my self and the workload I put on my self became significant. The only new machine learning tool introduced for this final part is K-means clustering, it's the most abstract concept on the entire specialization and I think it's the only one that could have been presented somewhat better. What I noticed while reviewing my peers is that for the assignments  everyone (me included) would just copy the k-means clustering algorithm and repeat the same analysis used on the labs. Which is kind of a shame, I just wish K-means clustering could have been developed better, beyond copy-paste.At then end it's you; the person taking this specialization, the one who decides how much work you're going to put into this.",0,0,Paul Anderson,64762051
