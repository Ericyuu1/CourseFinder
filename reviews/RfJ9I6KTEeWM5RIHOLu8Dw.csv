1296416~COURSE!~RfJ9I6KTEeWM5RIHOLu8Dw,1630429110749,2,0,The course was unfortunately slow and repetitive. Many of the videos could have been far more concise and the points were repeated over and over. The last week had interesting points to it but for the most part the whole course could have been done in two equivalent weeks. Rape and sexual trauma was skimmed and trotted around and the course would have been better if it made a point of not speaking about it altogether due to its different nature from other traumas mentioned. Good try but I felt I was forcing myself to watch the videos as there was so little to absorb from them that was not already evident as a self aware human.,0,0,Luca Cebria Richmond,1296416
