37563833~COURSE!~QDDRU5R_Eeq5HA70JpILIw,1619302110660,4,0,This is a very good introduction to some of the changes introduced to JavaScript in ES6. The material is presented in a logical manner. The instructor's explanations are generally quite good. Due to her accent I did have trouble understanding her a few times but I downloaded the transcript of the videos so if I was uncertain as to what she said in transcript -- problem solved.  It took me about 3 hours to complete the project but I took a lot of additional notes which probably added 30 minutes or so. One negative thing: The code for the 'challenge' was not in the file index.js so I had to type it all out. It isn't that long so it was no big deal. This same instructor has a couple more guided projects on JavaScript which I probably will take. Thank you.,0,0,Gary Crosby,37563833
