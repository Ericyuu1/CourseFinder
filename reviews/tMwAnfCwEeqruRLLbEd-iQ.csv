70904730~COURSE!~tMwAnfCwEeqruRLLbEd-iQ,1601798485307,4,0,"Good foundational, beginner Javascript class and the teacher explains very well. Too many coding classes are just a fast-talking professor saying ""type this here"" without any explanation of why. This class explains the why — knowing why is the only way you'll become an independent coder. However, with both class panels open, the video is way, WAY too small to read and cropped off. Both panels kept popping open every 2 minutes or so (all on their own!) when I was trying to watch the video. Annoying and very 2005, Coursera. ",0,0,Eileen Burke,70904730

The instructions were easy to follow, and the instructor was very knowledgeable. Overall, I would recommend this course and this instructor, especially as an introduction to the subject matter, though more practice and/or classes will be needed before you may be comfortable doing this on your own.",0,1,Mark Johnson,75030090
