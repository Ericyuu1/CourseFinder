10230935~COURSE!~nspFRcKhEemHBw4nQRO9tg,1620064848916,5,0,Just completed Part 5 of the Beethoven Sonatas.  As usual Jonathan Biss is an excellent instructor - very clear and well thought out and presented explanation and discussion.  His instruction has been very helpful to my understanding of these magnificent works.  I am looking forward to Part 6 and returning to re-listen to previous Parts.  One minor suggestion for Mr. Biss - when jumping ahead in the material it would be nice to have a bar # or other reference to locate the material; this happens only occasionally.  I look forward to listening to Mr. Biss's recordings of the sonatas. Thank you.,0,0,Gerald Maier,10230935
65854110~COURSE!~nspFRcKhEemHBw4nQRO9tg,1611612605247,5,0,"Once again, Mr. Biss takes on Beethoven Sonatas covering a breadth of periods and expressions, and gives them deeper meaning through highlighting general and specific aspects of the music itself. I admire his approach to Opus 106 (Hammerklavier) in that he covers this incredibly broad and deep work comprehensively in a way that does not fatigue. He keeps the wonder of the work alive and well. Bravo! ",0,0,Susan Lin,65854110

Part 5, by far, is the most technically challenging of the courses (with respect to passing the quizzes). I gained a much deeper appreciation and understanding of Op. 106 but still have a long ways to go. At least now, I no longer feel overwhelmed by the sonata.",0,0,Bruce Crowe,43787338
