120769025~COURSE!~jHFaIoy1EeuYmRKcAHP-DQ,1675174741699,2,0,Very high level with very basic examples. Short videos with the expectation that most learning will come from reading the information from links to documentation and other resources. The good thing about this course is the practice assignments can be done within the Coursera website without needing to download/install/or access anything externally. ,0,0,Devin Adams,120769025

INstructions for coding assignments are minimal yet have very strict rules leaving the student to rely on solved videos. Quizzes on this course are incredibly easy.,0,0,Patrick Haney,28661709
