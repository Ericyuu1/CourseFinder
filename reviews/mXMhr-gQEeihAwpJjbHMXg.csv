5003082~COURSE!~mXMhr-gQEeihAwpJjbHMXg,1607528271969,5,0,"I really enjoyed the course. The explanations are clear and engaging. The only downside is that I found it a bit challenging to follow the explanations on SDAccel and Vivado HLS in week 4. I believe a set of videos introducing Vivado HLS (quick introduction on design flow, HLS Pragma, etc) and OpenCL would have helped significantly. Thank you to the instructors!",0,0,Joel Mand√©bi,5003082
