It was difficult the understand, did not seem to address PHILOSOPHICAL thought experiments, unless you count experiments in format logic. I would not recommend this course to anyone.",0,0,Annette Velarde,67467872
117488288~COURSE!~ZQ31nO4GEeuMbw667oA5jw,1669153170720,3,0,"The course content described in the syllabus was just what I was looking for and, for the most part, it was delivered as described and was enlightening. However, Dr. DeMay is an enjoyable lecturer. However, his strong accent was, to my American English ears, difficult to follow. I was better able to follow when using the transcripts to read along with the video lectures. However, since the transcripts apparently are created using voice recognition software, there are quite a few errors in the sentence structure, words, capitalization, and punctuation. Trying to refer back to the transcripts for study without the videos was quite difficult when scanning for specific terms and ideas. The transcripts need considerable review and editing. For me, it was distracting and frustratingly difficult to comprehend the ideas being presented. I abandoned the course half way through. So this review applies only to the first four modules (weeks). Best of luck to anyone who attempts this course.",0,0,Jim Beach,117488288

I was not thrilled by his idea of using movies-film, if you will- to illustrate philosophical concepts; there are plenty of real life examples, but that is his choice.  I suggest taking  all quizzes and doing the final assignment. Overall very worthwhile.",0,0,T. W. tewaran,41289410
