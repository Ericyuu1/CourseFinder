This is a perfect example of the absolute worst type of old-style 
top-down history.  If the course had been called Egypt: Pharaohs and 
Gods I would have been happy, but calling it an introduction to Egyptian
 Civilization is disingenuous.  You will learn absolutely nothing about 
Egyptian civilization beyond its rulers.  There was no information at 
all about the common people; how they lived day to day, what their 
subsistence economy was like, how children were raised, how people 
attended the temples.  Absolutely nothing.  Civilization is more than a 
long listing of kings and dynasties but you wouldn't know that from this
 course.

The length  of the videos are very good but you do not need the introductory clip and the music every time. It gets boring after listening to it 10 times. I would like to make a few additional suggestions1- The speaker Prof Silverman is certainly a world expert in this field, but he is simply reading from a script in the most uninteresting and driest possible way. It is simply boring to listen to him but individuals who love to learn more about this topic will endure anyway. Is there a way to make the speeches more interesting and lively?2- I think there needs to be more substantive information and more data presentation as to how we know what we know. It is critical to mention where the information is obtained during the videos, not as recommended reading at the end. XYZ publications demonstrate that xxxx was recognized as the king in yyy tomb. etc.3- It is also helpful to provide more context by referring to what is happening in different parts of the world at the same time. Especially for middle and new kingdoms and certainly afterwards, Egypt's history is much more connected to the surrounding countries.In summary, I would like to say I enjoyed this course and I am glad to have taken it.

We are living in a time where a lot of the current idea's are being challenged in regards to Ancient Egypt, in the most part I thought David did a great job of just sticking to the facts, but also pointing out where things are current beliefs or assumptions based on the evidence at hand. Example he states the Pyramids were 'most likely built the the Egyptians' in the first Dynasty under its 2nd King - Khufu. I like this approach, I think we need to be open minded and flexible so we can go where the evidence takes us, not try and manipulate which evidence is put forward and mock other ideas that might seem somewhat far fetched.

So the ancient astronaut theory is extreme and somewhat far fetched, but not impossible. I don't believe that the Pyramids were built by Ancient Astronauts but the current evidence to support them being built by Khufu is in no way air tight and convincing. Therefore the AA theory has space to breed and grow, so I guess my point is perhaps David should just say he doesn't believe that theory and there is no solid evidence to support it.",0,0,Benjamin B hart,78745150

I have a much clearer understanding of the Egyptians now, and will continue to be in awe of this civilization and what it accomplished. It is obvious to me know how important the life and afterlife were, how important preservation is to them, and what goals they had for themselves in the future. In most ways, I would have to say that they were successful, as we are still reconstructing and preserving their efforts started 10000 years ago.",0,0,Caylene Bowden (Loving Life With Light),76332729

Penn's Museums courses are just amazing. Perfect length of time, a lot of facts based on real studies and references, Studying this course helped me go further in different aspects related to Egyptology, ancient Egypt in general and the religious, artistic point of views. The possibility to download, each lesson in a mp4 file, the subtitles as well. Multi-language subs that are great quality made from volunteers (thank you). But also to understand who are the gods in Egypt, How they come from, Where all happened and why. The importance and origins of the afterlife for the Egyptians of that period, the mummification process before mummification and after. A lot of questions answered and a lot of questions need answers but that is something that stimulates even more. I love the fact that you can study from home, yes but during the lessons you are inside a real museum that is showing the collection, so you can admire not only photos from the Dr. Silverman selection, but see him talking with real monuments in the background. Last but not least at the end a brief but delightful short talk with Dr. Silverman and a scientist talking in front of a mummy to raise more facts and more interesting questions...Thank you Coursera and Penn Museum and Dr.Silverman and the staff that made all this possible.
