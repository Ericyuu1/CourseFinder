However data engineering in the sense of building the dataset used by the model from raw data is missing, which is one of the most important part. Tons of online free example videos are there in youtube on how to apply SVM on real dataset, however for such paid project something extra was needed, which in my case was the data engieering.",0,0,Himanka Kalita,341017

I'd have liked a little explanation of *how* SVMs work (even just how predictions are made once model is trained), but it being ""beyond the scope of the project"" is not unreasonable",0,0,Ran Brynn Reiff,40253877
